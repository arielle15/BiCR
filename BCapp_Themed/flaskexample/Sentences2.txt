1	1	I have 0 sex drive and I had spotting and acne.
1	2	I was originally put on it for acne but it's also been very effective as birth control too.
1	3	I gained a lot of acne when previously my skin was clear.
1	4	My acne seems to be the same few break outs here and there.
1	5	Period is less heavy, skin is better, acne is disappearing.
1	6	I have had bad acne for the past 10+ years, so when I first started taking Apri and the acne subsided I was thrilled.
1	7	I have headaches, am tired all the time, tender boobs, severe cramping, bad acne and heavy periods.
1	8	No weight gain, no acne, no pregnancy lol.
1	9	Some pros are that my acne has cleared up and excess hair slowed its growth rate but the cons outweigh the pros.
1	10	helped my acne slightly.
1	11	Close to no acne.
1	12	It also bettered my severe cystic hormonal acne to only about a blemish or two a month.
1	13	When I'm not on birth control I have extremely painful menstrual cramps, very heavy periods, and crazy hormonal acne breakouts.
1	14	The main reason I am staying on the birth control is for the acne treatment!
1	15	I saw no difference in my acne.
1	16	I started this BCP because every month I grew cyst on my ovaries during ovulation which landed me in and out the hospital, I also suffered from moderate to severe acne, this birth control has regulated my periods, prevented the formation of cyst on my ovaries and I haven't had a breakout In weeks..the only down fall about this BCP is my increased appetite, but that's nothing that can't be controlled.
1	17	I had some pretty bad acne and my periods were heavy and long now my face is pretty clear and my period is still a little heavy but it's super short now (4 days tops) I haven't put on any weight since I started taking the pill my significant other and I haven't use a condom in over 4 years and I haven't gotten pregnant so it works!
1	18	I've never had any problems with my periods or acne.
1	19	I'm constantly moody and sad, I have heavy long-term periods, face covered in acne, low sex drive, hair loss, spots on my skin, sensitivity to most soaps and lotions.
1	20	Suddenly over the past 6 months my acne is terrible and I get menstrual migraines.
1	21	My acne has pretty much stayed the same, but my periods are lighter and shorter.
1	22	I've never had such bad acne in my life and it seems like it never stops.
1	23	I just finished my third pack of the pills and overall, I have gained weight, my acne got worse, but in all honesty, I have been eating pure sh*t while on the pill and even before so I can't really say if the acne and weight gain came from taking the pill.
1	24	Which is weird because I didn't pay out of pocket for my brand name birth control.. Anyways, within the first week I had acne all over my face.
1	25	My acne is about three times worse then normal - granted I don't have perfect skin, but it's really bad at this point.
1	26	I'm writing this review to confirm that I experienced acne as a side effect of this pill.
1	27	I've never had a problem with acne but as soon as I was put on this, it was just pimple after pimple after pimple.
1	28	I gained at least 8 lbs and my acne increased a bit.
1	29	My periods returned, were regular, no acne and my life quality went up.
1	30	Made acne worse!!!
1	31	If you already have issues with acne, I strongly recommend avoiding this medication.
1	32	I specifically asked my doctor for a birth control that would also help with acne.
1	33	I haven't experienced any spotting or acne.
1	34	I was taking it for acne and pregnancy protection.
1	35	I had terrible nausea and bad acne in the beginning, not to mention I spotted for a month straight and then bleed a period flow for another month.
1	36	I've been taking this pill for 4 months now and have gained 5-10lbs, the acne is still bad ( I'm 34 and no longer had it before apri ) oh and my libido is non existent since taking this medication.
1	37	My acne is ten times worse then it ever has been and I get moody/sad crying spells where all I can do is cry for no reason.
1	38	My breasts are also very tender and itchy, and my acne has gotten worse.
1	39	My period is very irregular, I have awful cramps, and my acne came back.
1	40	I didn't get any acne.
1	41	I have had severe headaches.My acne is worse then it's been in years and it's itchy.
1	42	The pill has helped with my acne, migraines, period regularity, and cramping.
1	43	And my acne has gotten worse.
1	44	I didn't gain weight, but it didn't really help with acne and it caused me to get my period about 2 times a month.
1	45	I've been on Apri for about a year now, since I took it I had no extreme side effects however, it didn't do much to regulate the length of my periods which stayed in 5 days, didn't clear up my skin though I never had an acne problem to begin with, I did take away my sex drive and I gained 7 pounds but I didn't get pregnant which is why I needed it to begin with.
1	46	I took Apri for my acne & birth control for 2 yrs & it worked great.
1	47	My acne came back immediately but my periods were lighter and I didn't have cramps while I was off of it.
1	48	My dermatologists prescribed me Accutane for my acne but I decided to try birth control again.
1	49	But 10lbs is better than acne!
1	50	As for clearing acne, my acne was already starting to fade away before taking the pill so I haven't had too many issues.
1	51	I've been taking Apri for 5 months now in hopes to clear my acne.
1	52	My acne didn't improve at all, if anything it made it worse.
1	53	It has cleared my acne almost completely but my cup size has gone from a D to a DDD (I am not a big girl so this was quite extreme and I would say the only side effect that has bothered me.
1	54	It has cleared up my acne, made my periods lighter, and my breasts went from a size B to a size C. The only negative effect is that it may have made my eyes even drier than they already are.
1	55	When I tried to stop using Apri, just to see how my body would react because I didn't want to be taking medicine for no reason, all my acne on my face came back and I even had acne on my chest and my back, which I had never had before.
1	56	It has kept my acne under control as well.
1	57	It cleared my oily skin and acne, but my hunger was out of control and my mood swings were awful.
1	58	My cup size went up to a C from a B, and my light acne has become almost non-existent.
1	59	Before I start my period, I get cramps, acne and I'm very moody on this pill.
1	60	No acne, no significant weight gain, no mood changes, no loss of sex drive.
1	61	I've been taking it for 2 months and it made my acne better, I'm not so moody and my periods are normal for once!
1	62	Fixed my acne right up and regulated my period.
1	63	Someone recommended I try Apri it has worked great for me cleared my horrible acne up which I was spending a lot of money on trying to correct, doesn't change my mood or sex drive, weight stayed the same, no headaches, no depression, light predictable periods lasts three days!
1	64	It's affordable and got rid of my acne.
1	65	I switched to Apri and the acne got a lot better but is still present, when it never used to be.
1	66	No acne, no weight gain, regular periods, no migraines (related to it), no decrease in sex drive.
1	67	I also have had worse acne and have been tired quite a bit.
1	68	I switched to this pill from Necon 1/35 to try and improve my acne in addition to birth control.
1	69	I had no acne, very light and short periods, no weight gain, and no mood swings.
1	70	On Apri, I now have mild acne especially on my period and I have horrible periods at that.
1	71	Luckily after the first month my acne completely cleared up, my depression went away and my periods are always same day and super light and short.
1	72	Prior to taking Apri, I had severe PMS (irregular periods, depression 1 week before and 1 week after my period, horrible cramps, acne) so my doctor suggested a birth control to help regulate my PMS symptoms.
1	73	After taking Apri, my acne has completely cleared up, no weight gain, 3 day periods with light bleeding, and no depression.
1	74	Also more acne than with my previous birth control pill.
1	75	My libido has never decreased nor have I gotten acne.
1	76	Not only that, the horrible acne on my back cleared up and now my back is beautiful.
1	77	My acne went away as well.
1	78	No change in breast size, and never had trouble with acne.
1	79	No other side effects, cleared my acne, and regulated my periods!
1	80	My minor acne decreased.
1	81	I had awful acne before and it all went away after a few months of taking the pill.
1	82	I have cramps and a little acne right before my period starts, but it's usually no big deal.
1	83	My acne has also been a huge problem since getting off of the pill.
1	84	In the first few months my boobs grew bigger and I have never had problems with acne so I can't say it cleared it but it definetly kept it away.
1	85	My face has cleared up but I still break out often and on Yaz I was completely acne free.
1	86	My acne has come back, I have horrible and frequent mood swings, I've gained at least 8 pounds around my hips, I completely lost my sex drive which is ruining my relationship with my boyfriend I have horrible cramps the whole week before and during my period AND I get it for at least 5 days.
1	87	My acne started to clear up and then today all of a sudden my face broke out in several huge pimples.
1	88	I've had no increase or decrease in my appetite or weight, hair seems almost thicker and I had no acne break out.
1	89	I just started and this is giving me bad acne and making me extremely tired.
1	90	My acne cleared up within 2 months of starting Apri.
1	91	My weight stayed the same and my acne cleared up though.
1	92	Noticeably increased my bra size and cleared up my acne
1	93	But I have worse acne now than I did when I was 13.
1	94	No mood swings, some acne though.
1	95	I was previously on Yaz both for birth control and to reduce my mild acne.
1	96	I'm half way through my third pack and my face has been continuously breaking out so bad since I started taking Apri.
1	97	April is awful I'm breaking out like a middle school boy and I'm itchy all the time.
1	98	I have to completely buy a new prescription because breaking out and being itchy "are not side effects".
1	99	I lost 15 pounds after switching and after about one month of breaking out, I was back to clear skin again.
1	100	First week on this stuff and my face is just COVERED with pimples, my face is itchy/irritated, and I feel awful.
1	101	It made my periods even lighter than they were before, I get no pimples, I've lost 15 pounds, my breasts went from a B to a D, and emotionally I feel the same as I did before it.
1	102	I have taken it for about a year and I no longer have cramps, I have lost weight, and my pimples have vanished.
1	103	It made me break out with huge pimples, when I previously had nearly perfect skin.
1	104	I've always had terrible periods  (cramps, heaviness, fatigue, moodiness) so I was hoping the pill could relieve some of those symptoms.
1	105	Been taking apri for 3 months; First 2 periods were fine no cramps, pretty normal.
1	106	Was extremely heavy, no cramps but the heaviest period I've ever had.
1	107	I've noticed slightly heavier cramps than normal, but they're not unbearable.
1	108	This made me completely regular, gave me way lighter periods that last at most 5 days, lowered my mood swings and reduced my cramps.
1	109	It took about 2 and a half months to see any improvements, but my face is almost always completely clear, I have much lighter cramps, and a much lighter flow.
1	110	The week before I was on the non active pill (white ones) i had cramps 5 days straight , when originally when I was off birth control I hardly had cramps.
1	111	While this pill did fix my cramps it did Also give me a blood clot after 3 Months of taking it that lodged in my ankle and then I ended up in the emergency room thinking I had compartment syndrome.
1	112	The cramps were horrible causing vomiting which never happened..
1	113	I never had bad period cramps before I started taking this pill, and now they are extremely painful.
1	114	I get cramps through-out the month and a lot of spotting.
1	115	I get severe cramps, bloating, and heavy periods.
1	116	Previous to this my experiences were heavy periods, terrible cramps, headaches, weight gain, constant spotting, 2 week long periods, anxiety which I never had before going on the pill.
1	117	My periods were still heavy and I got bad cramps.
1	118	I was throwing up, had really bad cramps, headaches, constant nausea, and frequent urination.
1	119	Started this birth control because I had really really bad cramps.
1	120	It cured my cramps and made my period lighter.
1	121	However, my periods are still fairly heavy and the cramps painful, and I suspect that the estrogen may have something to do with the migraines I experience, but I'm not sure.
1	122	I was put onto Apri because I had horrible cramps and long heavy periods.
1	123	My cramps went away, skin cleared up a little bit.
1	124	I started originally on Tri-Sprintec but after a few days I couldn't handle the cramps, bloating and spotting all the time.
1	125	Not to mention it works wonders for your cycle: mine's extremely consistent, my periods are lighter, and my once terrible cramps are distant memories.
1	126	I normally have very painful abdominal cramps but Apri has helped a lot with the pain.
1	127	I'm 13 and I take it for regulating my periods and making my cramps easier to handle.
1	128	I started taking it to prevent pregnancy, not for any other reason since my periods were regular and I rarely experienced any kind of cramps or moodiness.
1	129	I started experiencing cramps around the time my period began.
1	130	Yes, my periods are regular and I am not pregnant, but my cramps are extremely painful still, and I am very moody.
1	131	Lack of sex drive, mood swings, increased bra size from A to D, gained 10lbs, heavy 7 day period, cramps.
1	132	It did not help with cramps at all, and it made me gain a lot of weight.
1	133	I've never spotted, my cramps are milder then before I took it, I rarely have a blemish, never gained weight and for the past 2 years I've personally been having sex without a condom and never had a pregnancy scare (I don't know if it will be the same for everyone so use a condom!).
1	134	No cramps, 5 day periods, no mood swings, not pregnant.
1	135	I noticed my periods were shorter and the cramps were less.
1	136	But on the good side my periods are much shorter and my cramps are less awful.
1	137	I can predict my period to the day and get no cramps and it only lasts 2-3 days.
1	138	It started off good with lighter periods and no more cramps.
1	139	This birth control was great for reducing my periods and helping with endometriosis cramps, but it has made me very depressed and tired.
1	140	Continued to get pretty bad cramps the first day of my period.
1	141	It felt like really bad cramps.
1	142	If I missed more than a day, I got severe cramps, but they went away as soon as I was back on schedule.
1	143	I'm more tired than usual and get severe cramps on and off.
1	144	They've been unnoticeable and my cramps don't even exist anymore.
1	145	When my period came on after the first month I had really bad cramps.
1	146	I've been on Apri for 3 months, my periods are regular but I get horrible cramps, backaches and bloating.
1	147	I have cramps for about 2 days, and my periods are short.
1	148	I get extremely bad cramps, my hair is literally falling out, I have mood swings like crazy I've completely lost my appetite and somehow I've gained weight.
1	149	My sex drive is completely gone and my cramps are horrid.
1	150	I have lost my sex drive, and when my period starts I get horrible cramps.
1	151	Although my period is more predictable and more manageable in terms of pain, my 2nd and 3rd day of period is still very heavy and I still cramp a whole lot on the 2nd day.
1	152	I cramp, but not every cycle.
1	153	The only downside is if you miss a pill, you will bleed a lot and cramp, etc.
1	154	My periods are typically 4 supersoaker days with some cramping -2 days.
1	155	I was prescribed Loestrin in 2009 for bad cramping and PMS, but got off that due to huge mood swings, bloating, weight gain and breast tenderness.
1	156	I have had headaches several times per week, extreme nausea, cramping and tiredness.
1	157	I didn't experience many side effects at first, but with my first period on the new pill came painful cramping and heavy bleeding.
1	158	Before getting on this pill, I used to have horrible cramping and very heavy periods, lasting as long as 10 days.
1	159	My OBGYN said that being on this pill has significantly reduced my risk of breast cancer, and I have much more regular periods and less cramping.
1	160	I only get very light cramping right before my period starts.
1	161	I initially began taking birth control to control severe PMS and cramping and have switched pills 3 times, most recently to Apri.
1	162	The only downside I've noticed is intense cramping the first week I took it.
1	163	Very heavy with lots of cramping.
1	164	The only problems Ive had in the last few months using it is the cramping I get during my periods..its unbearable.
1	165	It has helped regulate my periods and made the cramping less severe.
1	166	In the last year or so, my period has become very heavy, lasting 4-5 days with cramping for at least 4 days.
1	167	I got on it to try and stop mid cycle spotting I was having and it made it worse (though I know to be fair you need to give a pill 3 months) I was way better off off of it.
1	168	Now I haven't got an actual period but I've been spotting for about 5 days now.
1	169	I was spotting the entire time I was on this birth control pill so obviously not effective.
1	170	I have have been moody, crying spells, decreased sex drive, and constant spotting.
1	171	I will get spotting for about a week or two after I get my period.
1	172	I get a little spotting the week after but I can deal with it.
1	173	My doctor prescribed it for three packs in a row therefore I only get my period four times a year and I have no spotting and no issues with my period when it comes.
1	174	I had some light spotting for the first 2 weeks but it has completely stopped now.
1	175	It made my period so regular that I knew to the day down to the hour that I would start my period, with absolutely no spotting in between periods.
1	176	I had a headache every day after starting to take this pill.
1	177	I'm so glad I did it's been 2 years and all I get is a headache around the time my period is due.
1	178	The first day I took it in the morning and had a bad headache that evening.
1	179	Also, not many side effects no headaches or nausea.
1	180	I've been nauseous everyday this week, gotten severe headaches, and now I am worried that my relationship is gonna be ruined because of the side effects this pill has on me.
1	181	I have terrible mood swings, headaches and nausea when i never had that before.
1	182	I get a lot of headaches, nausea and stomach discomforts for a week into starting a new pack, decreased libido, and in the beginning I'm quite dry which is uhm, have never been an issue for me, I get so moody, stress is harder to deal with, I get anxiety attacks, I get so easily fatigued, and the combination of these 2 I just get so unmotivated into doing daily activities.
1	183	I've been on it for 4 months now and it does its job I just get headaches almost everyday.
1	184	My skin has been super itchy all over since I've been on it and I've been getting stomach pains and headaches.
1	185	But I do get huge headaches from time to time and feeling dizzy for about 2 months now.
1	186	I had constant fatigue, frequent headaches, mood-swings, moodiness, and felt depressed a lot of the time.
1	187	I do not get any of the side effects - no headaches, mood swings, weight gain, etc.
1	188	I also get terrible headaches and am constantly tired.
1	189	Slight headaches and I feel sick sometimes.
1	190	I have noticed frequent headaches, at least a 15 pound weight gain, and ZERO sex drive.
1	191	Great pill,  because it made my periods regular but gave me MAJOR mood swing and headaches.
1	192	However, I have had severe nausea, headaches (on the verge of migraines), and slight bloating.
1	193	I have taken a lot of different kinds and I get serious headaches from taking the others.
1	194	Rated a 5 due to its effectiveness at preventing pregnancy but I stopped taking it after many years of this brand or the same ingredients in different brands because I've finally realized it is the cause of my frequent migraines, terrible moodiness and anger issues.
1	195	I had a lot of side effects within the past three months, such as terrible acid reflex, nausea, heavy bleeding, migraines, and my face broke out terribly.
1	196	During the sugar pill week, I had severe migraines which is something I never get.
1	197	I know it's been effective so far because I have migraines when I ovulate and no migraines on the pill, so I'm taking that to mean I'm not ovulating!
1	198	After a week on Apri, I started to have migraines every 3 days.
1	199	I also got migraines and felt nauseous sometimes.
1	200	My migraines got worse (almost every day) and sex drive went way down.
1	201	My sex drive went down horribly low in the past 12 months to the point where it became a problem.
1	202	Sex drive is pretty normal, and weight gain has not been out of control, as long as I watch my diet and get my steps in every day I stay in the 120-130 range.
1	203	Some days I have a very low sex drive, some days very high.
1	204	My sex drive is the same or even increased, weight is the same, appetite doesn't seem to increase.
1	205	I an 18 this is my 3rd birth control I tried in a year, Did the job but I definitely noticed a lower sex drive and feeling super emotional.
1	206	I also had no sex drive.
1	207	My sex drive increased and I was more wet during intercourse than my last pill.
1	208	My sex drive has decreased just a little, but nothing too major.
1	209	horrible lost all sex drive, was hungry all the time, cried for no reason, really annoyed 24/7, felt like a monster, made me self-conscious and feel worthless.
1	210	I've noticed my sex drive has decreased to being nonexistent except for during my period week.
1	211	Other than the decreased sex drive, this pill works fine for clearing my skin and preventing pregnancy.
1	212	My sex drive is nearly non existent.
1	213	I have no sex drive whatsoever.
1	214	completely lost every bit of sex drive i had.
1	215	My sex drive seems to be a tiny bit lower, but I never had a crazy high sex drive in the first place.
1	216	Worst part of this pill: no sex drive.
1	217	My mood has been pretty normal and my sex drive is good.
1	218	I've been on it about four months now and have seen a significant decrease in my sex drive, which, hello, sucks (newlywed, remember?).
1	219	The only thing that sucks about this pill is the noticeable decrease in sex drive, other than that it's fine.
1	220	I have found that I don't have much of a sex drive at all, but it's not worth it to me to switch just for that reason.
1	221	However, it absolutely killed every ounce of my sex drive which used to be high and healthy.
1	222	The only other complaint I could state would be that within a week of taking the pill, my sex drive was almost completely gone.
1	223	But I think the worst side effect is that my sex drive is non-existing which is affecting my relationship.
1	224	No depression, weight gain, loss of sex drive, or any other negative side effects.
1	225	I have been on it for 9 months and at first it was ok but after a while I would get painful, heavy periods the first day, backaches during period, breasts hurt all the time, and no sex drive whatsoever.
1	226	While off for 2 months, my weight had gone down, and sex drive went back to normal, and I head energy again.
1	227	It's not the pills fault, but you may notice weight gain, feel sluggish, and a lower sex drive if your body reacts to this the same way I do.
1	228	But, no decrease in sex drive and did prevent pregnancy.
1	229	So, I have gained weight, lost any sex drive (but I'm not active anyway), and am a little irritable.
1	230	My sex drive is the same, but I can't eat anymore.
1	231	My sex drive is usually very high.
1	232	After about 4 months though I completely lost my sex drive.
1	233	Since starting the pill I have noticed that those whiskers aren't growing anymore, also I have regular periods, my sex drive is normal and I have not gained any weight!
1	234	I lost all sex drive and was flat line.
1	235	My mood is better and my sex drive is back... so happy to be back on Apri this has really turned my life back around to where I was before.
1	236	It also has increased my sex drive immensely!
1	237	I noticed a considerable drop in my sex drive, which frustrated both me and my boyfriend.
1	238	I also have a very diminished sex drive.
1	239	I have not gained any weight, my sex drive is the same it was before I started taking the pill and my insurance covers it.
1	240	Mood swings are horrible, appetite is horrible, no sex drive at all.
1	241	Sex drive has increased.
1	242	I haven't noticed a decrease in sex drive, but I haven't seen my boyfriend as often as usual so when he moves back I guess we'll see.
1	243	Overall I suggest this pill to many of my close friends because my sex drive is still high and they see how I've never had a mood swing, or bloated.
1	244	I've been takin Apri for about 3 wks now....my sex drive is extremely high, even 15-20 minutes after I take the pill.
1	245	I also have lost my sex drive.
1	246	I do believe it decreased my sex drive because it has changed since I started taking this pill.
1	247	I also have my sex drive, which I never really knew was gone until I switched to Apri.
1	248	My bra size definitely got higher, and my sex drive hasn't changed at all.
1	249	And in the last year and a half I have had no sex drive.
1	250	However I'm really starting to debate if the no sex drive is worth it.
1	251	The zero sex drive is NOT like me, and has affected my relationship.
1	252	I've seen a little weight gain and loss of sex drive, and I do feel as though I'm a little more emotional.
1	253	I lost my sex drive, wanted to eat everything in sight, and was very emotional.
1	254	This one didn't seem to have much effect on me besides NO sex drive....
1	255	I have completely lost my sex drive which is hurting my relationship and I feel depressed all the time.
1	256	My sex drive has decreased slightly, but I won't let that put a damper on my nights.
1	257	My sex drive has vanished along with when I am in the mood I have horrid vaginal dryness and I've gained weight in my lower parts.
1	258	I haven't gained weight and my skin is good, but my sex drive is completely gone.
1	259	My baby is almost 4 months old and prior to taking Apri I was on Camilia which  made me have a non-stop period and no sex drive.
1	260	With Apri I've noticed I'm moodier, no sex drive, depressed, suicidal thoughts, all of which I have NEVER had any of these problems.
1	261	My sex drive is almost completely gone which causes problems between my fiance and I. I am also very moody all the time.
1	262	However, over time, I lost my sex drive.
1	263	I quit Apri immediately hoping the sex drive will come back and my fibroids will start to shrink a little.
1	264	Very sad, no sex drive and 15 more pounds.
1	265	My sex drive I feel is higher but I do get more discharge and my breasts got bigger so 10 for this pill and good price too!
1	266	My breasts have gotten slightly larger and my sex drive has increased.
1	267	I have NO sex drive what so ever, which is affecting my relationship with my almost husband (in 5 weeks!)
1	268	I didn't really notice any changes in my sex drive.
1	269	Been taking Apri for about 2 1/2 months and I've gained about 10lbs, my sex drive is extremely low and I'm really moody for no apparent reason.
1	270	So far I haven't gained weight, my periods are regular, but I have had an EXTREME decrease in sex drive, enough to affect my relationship.
1	271	I have the worst mood swings and my sex drive is completely gone.
1	272	I have been using Apri for 5 months, and having had any weight gain and no decrease in sex drive.
1	273	I don't know why people are saying that their sex drive is gone.
1	274	It has not made me any more moodier or has not changed my sex drive and my periods are way normal.
1	275	I completely lost my sex drive as well so it is hurting my relationship.
1	276	My boobs have gotten much bigger, and I haven't seen the decrease in sex drive that many others are seeing.
1	277	Apri made me gain weight and lose my sex drive.
1	278	Well I have been on Apri for about a year now and believe me my sex drive is gone and my boyfriend hates it.
1	279	Some say it lowers sex drive but my sex life has stayed the same.
1	280	It has SERIOUSLY messed up her sex drive.
1	281	My libido was non existent even after taking it for more than 3 months.
1	282	:I lost 5 pounds and my skin is clearer than ever and I am NOT pregnant and my libido is still intact way better than ortho tri cyclen
1	283	I figured it wouldn't happen to me since I had a very strong libido but it is now gone.
1	284	Weight gain?
1	285	Got my period exactly every 28 days, no major side effects except for weight gain (part of which I blame for starting college at the same time).
1	286	Made my skin clearer, and no problems of weight gain either.
1	287	No weight gain or other side affects.
1	288	My periods were shorter and I didn't experience any weight gain at all.
1	289	So far no weight gain either, my skin hasn't broken out on this, and my boobs are getting bigger (plus for me, being an A cup).
1	290	However, I have noticed some weight gain (10 lbs) or so and I cannot seem to lose it.
1	291	My doctor did warn me about the initial side effects, and they were pretty bad honestly (highly emotional, weight gain about 10 lbs), but after I gave it 3 months something clicked and I stopped being emotional and I have lost all the weight and even a bit more.
1	292	I did feel a little nauseous for the 1st couple days, but I had no weight gain and no other adverse health or psychological complaints.
1	293	While Apri may not have been the direct cause of my 'episode', I definitely attribute it to my weight gain.
1	294	Highly recommend, no weight gain or mood swings compared to other birth control pills I have taken.
1	295	However I've noticed recent weight gain (10 lbs in 2 wks) & increase in my appetite & cravings.
1	296	No weight gain
1	297	Weight gain is A LOT easier but like anything it can be controlled with extra effort.
1	298	I have been on it for 2 months and the weight gain in my belly is ridiculous!
1	299	The only thing is I'm hungry more often, no weight gain though.
1	300	I have had almost no breakthrough bleeding, no weight gain and no problem with weight gain.
1	301	I have always been small (5'4 108 lbs) so this weight gain was very noticeable and I could not shed the weight.
1	302	No side effects or weight gain or anything!
1	303	Besides for the awful weight gain the only other symptom I experienced was lots of crying.
1	304	I never cried before I began the pill but if you can stand the weight gain and crying I strongly recommend.
1	305	No noticeable weight gain.
1	306	I can't say much about weight gain, because I've only been on it a week, but I haven't noticed any chance as far as that goes.
1	307	Went on Apri and have never had ANY side effects (nausea, weight gain, etc.).
1	308	No weight gain at all, no bigger boobs either but it beats having babies!
1	309	The only downfall is major mood swings and weight gain.
1	310	I have no drive, low energy (I'm sure from bleeding for 2 months), I just want to eat all the time, I've gained weight, overall this BC didn't mesh very well with my body.
1	311	I've gained weight, but I don't think Apri was the cause.
1	312	Didn't gain weight at first, then I gained 10-15lbs, and overall I gained 35-40lbs.
1	313	I feel bloated all the time, I've gained weight in my face and stomach.
1	314	I have gained 15 pounds in 4 months despite getting 2 hours of exercise almost everyday.
1	315	This is one of those drugs that sneak up on you been on this shit for 8 months the first couple months I felt fine but by the 6th month I started having horrible pregnancy symptoms even though I wasn't pregnant and overall I've had anxiety attacks depression spells and I've gained water weight from the pills.
1	316	gained about 10 pounds, mostly in my breast.
1	317	I might have gained like 5 pounds or less but that might be because of my lazy ass and not the birth control :) best of all, I haven't gotten pregnant!
1	318	I don't think I've gained much, if any, weight other than in my chest, but I've had some nausea every day I take the active pill and I might be running a bit warmer/sweatier than my normal temperature.
1	319	This past month, I've gained around 10 pounds, reaching the 120s.
1	320	On top of that, I gained about 40 pounds.
1	321	I got off of this birth control this month because I have gained almost 30lbs since I started it in May and it is now December and I'm gigantic.
1	322	As for changing my weight, I believe Apri has actually helped regulate my weight, so I haven't gained any pounds nor lost any while maintaining the same diet.
1	323	I've also gained at least 10 pounds in addition to my normal weight and that's being modest.
1	324	Also after 4 months on apri I gained about 9lbs while doing cardio and eating a healthy diet.
1	325	I just got back on April  and it's day four and I have already gained about 5 lbs.
1	326	I have been using Apri for 3 months and I have gained 10 pounds.
1	327	I haven't really noticed any mood changes but I've been taking B6 pills everyday with it since that's what I had to do while on my last BC and I def haven't gained any weight.
1	328	During the first month I experienced extreme nausea and gained 5lbs quickly!
1	329	In addition to that, I gained at least 5 lbs in that short amount of time and had mood swings.
1	330	Then about a month in I gained over 10 pounds even though I didn't change my diet or exercise.
1	331	I've gained about 10lbs since on this pill, even though I workout and eat healthy I can't lose the weight.
1	332	I gained maybe 5 lbs.
1	333	I definitely have not gained weight from it if anything it makes me feel full faster and longer.
1	334	With this pill, I constantly felt tired and had to monitor what I ate so I didn't gain weight (I gained about 5 pounds, still working out although not as intense as before due to being tired, BUT I was eating less!)
1	335	I have gained weight in the last year, I wasn't sure if it was caused by the birth control, so I went off of it for about 6 months.
1	336	I've gained 5 pounds.
1	337	I also gained about 5-7 pounds and I could have been imagining it, but I thought my legs started feeling funny at night.
1	338	I haven't gained any weight.
1	339	I gained weight all in my stomach and had horrible horrible bloating before my period for about 3 days.
1	340	I haven't gained any weight - just fluxed a bit up and down a few pounds.
1	341	I would get breakthrough bleeding at the most random times and gained about 15 pounds.
1	342	I don't think I've gained weight off this pill, my weight fluctuates on its own but I have noticed (for me) significant increase in breast size, which I and my boyfriend love.
1	343	My breasts have grown almost 2 full cup sizes but I have not gained weight anywhere else.
1	344	After a few months of Tri-Sprintec I gained 17 lbs!
1	345	My appetite increased so much to the point I have gained 8 pounds.
1	346	I haven't noticed that I have gained weight, but I am always hungry and have a lot of cravings, period is regular and its nice to know when the time comes.
1	347	My periods are much better but I have noticed that I have gained a bit more weight.
1	348	I have taken Apri for 4 months now and have gained over 20lbs.
1	349	In the first month, I gained 12lbs just around my love handles, and my breasts grew a whole cup size bigger.
1	350	I gained about 5lbs just in my butt since using this birth control.
1	351	Bad thing is that after two months of use I have gained 3-4 pounds.
1	352	I am on this medicine for couples months now and have gained weight and my depression came back full force.
1	353	I've only been on this for about a week and I have already gained 7 pounds!
1	354	My breats got noticeably larger within the first few weeks and I gained about 10 pounds, but I'm a thin girl anyway so I gladly take on the extra few pounds and curves.
1	355	After I had my daughter I had lost 50 lbs, but I have gained that and probably plus some back.
1	356	I do have bigger boobs, get super hungry (not just normal hunger) but haven't gained weight.
1	357	I have gained a lot of weight on my hips and stomach.
1	358	I am not moody at all, and haven't gained any weight.
1	359	The only problem is that in 18 months on the pill I have gained about 20 pounds, with very little change in my diet and exercise.
1	360	I my boobs got huge on this pill but as well as them I also gained a extra weight on my hips.
1	361	I've been taking Apri for 7 months now and have gained about 8 pounds.
1	362	Those continued and then nausea was added to it.
1	363	I've never once experienced any nausea or negative side effects from taking the pill.
1	364	The worst thing has been the nausea.
1	365	I've also seen mood swings and nausea the last couple months as my body has been adjusting, and I'm just not about that life.
1	366	The first few months I may have had a little bit of nausea and bloating, but that's all gone now.
1	367	However, I do have some slight blurred vision, a stuffy chest feeling, and a bit of nausea.
1	368	One day I had a bit of nausea it didn't last long.
1	369	Over 6 months ago I switched to this from a more traditional bc pill because of nausea.
1	370	Taking this pill before bedtime helped with the nausea.
1	371	Since then my periods have gone back to normal, I've gone up 2 cup sizes in the last 8 months, but I have been experiencing some very mild nausea and lightheadedness.
1	372	It's regulated my periods so I can predict it down to the hour, they're less painful, I feel less nausea, and they're much shorter and lighter!
1	373	We fight constantly and I have horrible mood swings, and I always have nausea.
1	374	I've bled the entire time being on this pill, mood swings, dark thoughts, very emotional, nauseated  all the time, the bloating is so uncomfortable (prior to starting this pill I had my waist back and almost a flat stomach but now I look like I'm a few months pregnant again!)
1	375	I felt nauseous the first few days.
1	376	Made me nauseous and weak from the excessive blood loss.
1	377	Also makes me nauseous.
1	378	But about the only downfall to this medication is that if I don't eat quite a bit right before I take it, I'll wake up in the middle of the night feeling nauseous & not able to go back to sleep.
1	379	In the beginning I was also super nauseous but that is fairly typical in my experience.
1	380	Even after one shot, or a glass of wine I would feel very nauseous and immediately throw up.
1	381	I've jumped around to many birth control pills through the years - some landed me in the hospital with severe blinding abdominal pain, some made me suicidal, and some made me nauseous.
1	382	I went to work and was very nauseous.
1	383	Apri made me sick to my stomach everyday and I had to quit taking it because I kept getting nauseous and wanted to get sick!
1	384	The only side effect I've noticed has been waking up at night or falling asleep at night extremely nauseous, but I assume that's normal because my body is adjusting to the pill.
1	385	When I first started on Apri, it made me nauseous in the mornings.
1	386	I got really nauseous from it the first day.
1	387	For the first month I was always nauseous or on the verge of throwing up within literally 30min-1hr of taking the pill [I learned that eating right after helped a lot] But I decided to give it a go until the second month.
1	388	The first week or so I was waking up nauseous, but since then it's gone away.
1	389	All of them have caused me to become nauseous, moody, etc.
1	390	I was nauseous on the very first day I took the pill and I am still sensitive to smells.
1	391	My first month on this hellbent pill was constant cramping+nausea, 25 days of bleeding, and horrid mood swings, dark thoughts, deja vu and dizzy spells.
1	392	Since I read reviews before hand, I'm in total control of my mood swings since I know its the birth control making me agitated.
1	393	During the third week, I had mood swings and felt depressed, but I always feel this way a week before my period, so it was normal to me.
1	394	The downside is the absolutely AWFUL mood swings, and I mean awful.
1	395	My mood swings were out of  wack when I first started the pill.
1	396	Do NOT take this birth control as it leads to childbirth and mood swings.
1	397	Mood swings could probably be better, but that comes with all young female adults under stress anyway.
1	398	Within the first month I experienced some mood swings and I would get emotional.
1	399	I have taken this for 3 months now and my period has been regular but   I  extreme mood swings.
1	400	I had noticeable mood swings that were not present before going on Apri.
1	401	The past few months, however, my periods have been heavier than before I started the pill and I have severe mood swings that have affected my life drastically.
1	402	Her mood swings are unpredictable and unexpected we have been married for 4 years and it has been really trying on me and us.
1	403	Ever since being on Apri I have noticed a huge change in my mood swings, they're basically gone.
1	404	Another bad side effect are the mood swings which happen frequently.
1	405	However, I have noticed a dramatic increase in mood swings with Apri.
1	406	The downfalls to Apri is that I have crazy mood swings and it's taking a big toll on our relationship.
1	407	I started gaining weight almost immediately and suffered through some pretty wild mood swings.
1	408	I haven't experienced any mood changes amd i still weigh about the same.
1	409	First time on birth control and was nervous that I'd have the horrible side effects that I've heard about online and through friends.
1	410	When I first started taking Apri which was a year ago I found that it changed my mood a lot making me depressed, anxious and angry all the time for no reason.
1	411	Please if you are experiencing depression, anger issues, anxiety or similar issues don't write it off, it will begin to have a huge affect on your daily life.
1	412	It gives me crazy amounts of anxiety, I've had anxiety a couple times in my life but it's an everyday thing now.
1	413	I've always been an outgoing go getter type of person, but all I wanna do now is sleep and ignore my anxiety.
1	414	I have pretty bad anxiety already, and the shot pretty much made it worse.
1	415	I don't take any medications for my anxiety, because I don't believe I need to but I had to with the depo shot.
1	416	I switched to this birth control from Gildess fe 1/20 (It made me depressed intensified my anxiety and I was having two periods a month).
1	417	I have also felt anxiety and will wake up in the middle of the night.
1	418	Before Apri, I had been experiencing very tender breasts, break outs, and constant food cravings before my period would start.
1	419	Last month the day after my cycle, my first yeast infection.
1	420	On my fourth pack and the new side effect i have is yeast infections!
1	421	Only side effect I've experienced is an increase in yeast infections (about one a year) since I started taking it.
2	1	And my face (normaly pretty clear) has broken out with so much acne and I've experienced vaginal dryness.
2	2	No acne, no mood swings.
2	3	But here now I’m so depressed, anxiety ridden, have acne all over my face and behind my ears!
2	4	No acne just broke out little bumps along jaw line but no one can notice except me.
2	5	This pill gave me the worst acne I have ever experienced.
2	6	& it cleared up all my acne!
2	7	No weight gain , mild mood swings , helps with acne ( keeps my skin super clear ) although I'll get a occasional pimple here or there.
2	8	I have AWFUL migraines, acne, gained weight, TERRIBLE mood swings, and the worst cramps.
2	9	I'm super moody, terrible acne, mild to excruciating cramp pain, I'm having outburst at work, and crying myself to sleep.. just stay away from this.
2	10	Grateful I haven't experienced acne, mood changes, nausea or headaches.
2	11	I had acne before starting, and Aubra neither cleared this nor worsened my skin.
2	12	Ever since I started taking this pill my acne has only gotten worse.
2	13	Already I've had bad mood swings, gained weight and also I'm currently experiencing the worst acne I've ever had.
2	14	My acne is so bad, it hurts my face so much.
2	15	Medication made me depressed easily over nothing never was one for mood swings also it was a constant struggle to stay awake period went from super tampons to ultra tampons acne for the first time in my life after I decided to get off of it and worst of all it made sexual sensitivity numb to any stimulation so glad to be off of this garbage...
2	16	Started developing horrible acne which I have never had before and I know its from the pill :( it comes on a week before my period every month and lasts 2 weeks.
2	17	I also developed extremely bad acne which I never had before.
2	18	I had pretty bad acne before starting, and my face cleared up within the first pack or two.
2	19	Similarly with acne, I had a flare the first few weeks I used it, but afterwards my acne has severely improved and I've had a clear face since.
2	20	To be fair though, I never had bad acne to begin with.
2	21	Cleared acne.
2	22	Only time I would get acne was close to my monthly cycle.
2	23	I had little to no acne before taking it, and I have noticed I only get a few pimples here and there, my sex drive has not changed at all still pretty good.
2	24	As the days have gone by my face, neck and upper back have broken out in very painful acne.
2	25	I am 28 and haven't had any major acne since I was 19.
2	26	On the bright side, my boobs got bigger, I have not gained any weight, and my acne has decreased.
2	27	Cons: no sex drive, horrible acne before my period, depression, weight gain.
2	28	Got lil acne before I was on it and get a lil still.
2	29	It has cleared up my acne drastically.
2	30	I still get a little bit of acne, but not near as bad as before.
2	31	The first week was fantastic but on my second week, I noticed some acne or rashes on my forehead.
2	32	i've never had acne problems besides an occasion zit here and there.
2	33	Update I been on it 2 months extreme acne huge boil looking pimples all over my face and in ears ouch hair loss worsening depresion weight gain because I can't stop eating
2	34	It did clear my acne.
2	35	Try and clear up my acne.
2	36	Some symptoms: sickness (worse right after taking the pill and more around 1-4am), migraines, bad cramps (on and off period), nausea (I still haven't vomited but there are times where I think it'll be more satisfying then feeling like it), my stomach sticks out like a balloon, I've been pretty emotional (I get really sad and have no idea why), I fainted twice and get dizzy often, my body feels weak and I bruise easily, both knees cramp up, but my period is regular and light and my acne has went down.. also I'm not pregnant so that's good too.
2	37	I've just completed my first week I've experienced so far anxiety, sudden fleeting waves of nausea, appetite increase ,acne , mood swings, worsening depression I hope it gets better
2	38	Boobs grew for sure and acne has cleared up.
2	39	I was fine before taking birth control, i went on it for acne and to regulate my periods but now I don't think it was really worth it, it's starting to make me feel like I'm starving like an hour after I eat a full meal.
2	40	So here it goes:  I am a 33 year old female who was not taking any form of BCP and I wanted to get on the pill because I had been having really annoying acne lately (not sure why) and also my periods had become heavy and bothersome.
2	41	One month later, my acne is completely cleared up, no new breakouts at all, my entire completion even looks clearer, I have absolutely no side effects WHATSOEVER, and my period is even much lighter than usual!
2	42	I've never gained weight, felt bloated, had acne, or ANYTHING until taking Aubra.
2	43	I'm experiencing acne, bleeding and cramping between periods, severe anxiety, headaches, moodiness, and weight gain.
2	44	It helped with acne.
2	45	This was the very first birth control brand I've taken, I was so happy because it didn't give me any weight gain or acne.
2	46	The first month was awful a lot of spotting that sometimes required a tampon, my sex drive stayed the same, second month I changed my time to taking the pill in the morning , sex drive the same no weight gain but horrible acne.
2	47	I hadn't had acne since junior year of highschool and now my forehead is covered and I've had ance on my cheeks and jaw (which i have never had in my teen years) .
2	48	No weight gain nothing different with acne I feel normal and great!!
2	49	I'm moody, irritable, depressed, hungry, bitchy... vaginal discharge has changed  (gross), my urine smells, my acne has gotten so out of hand and it's STUBBORN.
2	50	Cystic acne all around my mouth, jawline, Chin and neck.
2	51	The only problem I have with this birth control is it has made my acne worse!
2	52	I guess half a bottle of foundation to cover up my acne is better than having an unplanned pregnancy so I guess I will have to live with the complications it comes with.
2	53	At first, gildess cleared my acne but it gave me severe mood swings along with constant headaches.
2	54	After the 2nd month, my acne got worse and that was the last straw for me to go and switch pills.
2	55	The constant headaches are gone, my period lasts about 4 days, no mood swings whatsoever, and my acne is fairly mild.
2	56	Still got cramps around the second day and acne about a week or so prior to my period.
2	57	I've been gaining weight and breaking out and freaking out at my boyfriend and having random bouts of depression that is usually controlled by other medication I take.
2	58	i've been on this birth control now for almost 3 months and i've been breaking out like crazy.
2	59	I have never in my life experienced any skin problems, but once I got on this pill I had pimples all over my face.
2	60	The first day I took it I felt a little nauseous but switched to taking it before bed and now don't feel anything (even if I forgot the night before & have to take it in the middle of the day) I did get two pretty big pimples the first week but no physical changes besides that.
2	61	Since I got on it though, I've noticed that my skin got worse- pimples appearing everywhere- bigger than I've ever gotten in my life.
2	62	I use to get huge pimples on my forehead right between my eyes and it wouldn't go away, even after months of ance face washed and spot treatments.
2	63	Gave me cyst like pimples all over my body.
2	64	Skin is fine, do get 2 or 3 zits but very tiny.
2	65	After taking this birth control my face has huge zits everywhere!
2	66	I have experienced extremely painful cramps and weight gain.
2	67	However I still get cramps and occasional mood swings occur.
2	68	I was on Loestrin/ LoMedia for close to 10 years, never had an issue, never had bad periods with it (my periods before BC were debilitating, I would always get sick and have heavy long periods with death cramps).
2	69	Have had painful cramps and back pain since I started it.
2	70	Still have the mild cramps, but bad back pain.
2	71	Monday back pain was insane and my cramps hurt so bad I ended up in the ER.
2	72	Today is day 3 and my cramps a horrible as well as back pain.
2	73	First day light cramps that's it.
2	74	No more severe cramps and my period is light flow and it only lasts 3/4 days, used to be heavy lasting 6 days.
2	75	At least my cramps stopped and breast tenderness stopped but other than that HORRIBLE!
2	76	I hardly ever get cramps on it and I don't really get any side effects on it.
2	77	Third week and I'm having terrible cramps accompanied with more bleeding.
2	78	I THINK I'm on my period now (end of first pack) but very very light bleeding & no cramps.
2	79	I'm nauseous, fatigued, and get cramps constantly.
2	80	On top of that, my periods actually got worse; heavier bleeding, really bad cramps, etc.
2	81	In addition my cramps and periods are a lot shorter and less severe.
2	82	It eased my cramps a lot and doesn't make me break out.
2	83	I had severe cramps& headaches.
2	84	Helps with cramps that were extremely painful- passing out painful before taking it, to barely noticeable on this pill.
2	85	I've been taking aubra for about 6-7 months now, and I have had no major side effects, the only thing I can really complain about is before when I got my period I  would never get cramps, now when I do have it I get cramps but they are very minor.
2	86	No cramps, light, no bloating, good energy level, and exactly the right number of days.
2	87	Along with the spotting I've been getting cramps that feel worse than my usual period cramps.
2	88	At first it was nice because my periods were lighter, and my cramps weren't too bad.
2	89	I was on lutera but I changed doctors and he only had aubra so I started taking that and horrible I bleed non stop and it gave me horrible cramps.
2	90	I feel normal except my sex drive really lowered and I get horrible cramps and bloats on my period.
2	91	I get very light periods now that last two days with little to no cramping.
2	92	The first month of taking it I only spotted for two days, but the second month my period was normal with less cramping.
2	93	Only PMS I  had was slight cramping and nausea.
2	94	I have had no weight gain, and no cramping.
2	95	My stomach gutted so bad from cramping.
2	96	However, my sex drive has drastically decreased, I've been cramping since week 2, I've been extremely emotional, and now I've been menstruating longer than usual (it has always been 3-4days now I'm on day 6).
2	97	Started taking these pills because I was cramping a lot during my period and they were heavier than usual.
2	98	6 mths later, I've noticed that I'm super emotional/sad, periods are inconsistent, 1 month its heavy w/break thru bleeding for about 4-5 days, spotting for about 2 weeks before and or even after my period, the next month I may not bleed much at all and the cramping hasn't decreased.
2	99	My 1st week of taking Aubra I experienced some cramping and it made me cry.
2	100	The first month was OK because I had a very mild period week, minimal cramping.
2	101	I started to get inter-menstrual cramping and sharp pain in between periods.
2	102	With this I felt really sick and crampy if I took more than 2.
2	103	I had a little spotting Saturday no pain Sunday little more blood severe pain like never before.
2	104	No spotting.
2	105	I got my period almost twice a month and a lot of spotting.
2	106	I did experience some spotting and nausea when I first began, but that subsided after a few days.
2	107	My period is nothing more than a day or two of spotting which is pretty cool but the constant moodiness and terrible nausea are not worth it.
2	108	I just started taking this birth control (Aubra) and so far, I haven't notice any really crazy symptoms or spotting.
2	109	I don't have spotting.
2	110	The third month I started spotting for 2 weeks before I got my period and only had it for 3 days.
2	111	Periods have been lighter which is a plus but obviously all the blood that should be draining isn't because of all the spotting.
2	112	Other than that my skin doesn't break out and I haven't had any spotting in between!
2	113	I also had some spotting in between periods and I gained some weight as well.
2	114	Ever since starting Aubra I’ve woken up 5/7 days of the week with a headache and absolutely no ambition to get out of bed.
2	115	I had severe stomach issues, sweating, and as the week went on, I had vision problems and an extreme headache that was getting worse instead of better.
2	116	I have had the worst headache of my life for two weeks straight not to mention the nausea and vomitting.
2	117	The first week I had constant headaches but they went away and now everything is fine.
2	118	I started to break out, a ton of headaches, mood swings, and weight loss.
2	119	For the first three weeks, I suffered from constant nausea, severe headaches, shortness of breath,  IBS like symptoms, emotional instability, and I felt extremely lethargic.
2	120	I started aubra back in July so I would be less anxious about pregnancy.The first month or two I was on it, I had headaches and nausea, as well as random bleeding.
2	121	I have had terrible headaches and have broke out in hives all over my face and arms.
2	122	I would get mild headaches but nothing ibuprofen couldn't fix.
2	123	I've also noticed an in increase in the frequency of bad headaches and a lack of energy.
2	124	But on this one my only side effects were mild headaches and I'm definetly mode emotional.
2	125	I had terrible headaches, dizziness, and was moodier and found myself crying at the slightest things that normally wouldn't have upset me.
2	126	been nauseous and have been having severe headaches, which i never get, and to top it off oh boy i have been EMOTIONAL!!!
2	127	I've also been getting headaches MUCH worse than I'm used to that seem to last forever.
2	128	Surprisingly, I have been on the pill for two whole months and the only mild symptoms I could think of that I've had are two bad headaches and the bloating feeling closer to my placebo week.
2	129	I had headaches very often, even more so when it got close to my period.
2	130	I never had headaches prior to Aubra.
2	131	I started this pill on day 1 of menstrual cycle last month and haven't had a period yet... have had plenty of headaches though!
2	132	No mood swings or headaches.
2	133	At first I experienced terrible migraines for the first few weeks, but afterwards they went away.
2	134	Sex drive seems to be normal as a a lot of people say otherwise.
2	135	My depression and anxiety was off the charts, also I had low sex drive.
2	136	It has killed my sex drive (I’m 18), caused dryness, made my boobs smaller, and worst of all worsened my depression which has negatively affected my relationship as if the others weren’t enough.
2	137	Sex drive remained as high as always.
2	138	Kills your sex drive.
2	139	Right now my only complaint is my breast are really tender, but other then that I have more of a sex drive which my fiance and I aren't really complaining about lol so I really recommend this pill if nothing else has worked.
2	140	However, now five months in, I have absolutely no sex drive, my last period lasted 13 days, and I have been in a depressed-like rut for about two months.
2	141	I broke out like crazy, my mood swings are just incredible, PMS is horrible, my sex drive is gone and natural lubrication is a problem for me now.
2	142	It also kills your sex drive... as for the difference in bleeding, I wouldn't know.
2	143	Now that I have been on it for over 6 months, I have zero sex drive at all and I'm very moody, constantly hungry, my breasts decreased in size, and I get intense bouts of nausea.
2	144	I'm more depressed than ever, my libido is extremely low and I barely climax, I cry all the time and it's causing relationship issues.
2	145	No weight Gain.
2	146	I didn't experience any weight gain, I did have some mood swings but that's basically it.
2	147	I haven't had any significant weight gain and my breasts feel rounder and firmer.
2	148	I have not experienced any mood swings weight gain or weight loss.
2	149	No weight gain, no weird mood swing.
2	150	I haven't experienced too much of the side effects like weight gain, nausea, or anything.
2	151	No weight gain either.
2	152	The pill does work against pregnancy which is great but the emotions and weight gain is the bad part about the pill.
2	153	And no weight gain at all.
2	154	I love it so far, I don't feel any symptoms and no weight gain.
2	155	When I first started taking it I found myself hungrier than usual & with an increased appetite, and I gained almost 10 lbs, but after the first few months my appetite curbed and went back to normal & I lost the weight.
2	156	I gained 10 lbs.
2	157	My period is regular and light, I have not gained weight, my boobs have grown and are firmer and my skin is perfectly clear nowadays.
2	158	The first time I gained 10 pounds but I am also an active person and go to the gym daily, so I lost it pretty quickly.
2	159	I gained about 25 lbs in less than a year.
2	160	and i've gained 10 pounds.
2	161	I haven't gained weight.
2	162	I recently have noticed I've gained a lot of weight.
2	163	I've gained a little weight, but my belly is so bloated like I'm 4 months prego.
2	164	Plus in addition to all that, I haven't gained weight since I've been on it!
2	165	I gained about 15lbs in 3 months, but I also had moved across country and started a new desk job, so cant account that all to the medication.
2	166	I haven't gained weight like I did with the other one and I am not so emotional.
2	167	No nausea from this.
2	168	The first 2 days or so I had a slight twinge of nausea that would come and go but I barely noticed it.
2	169	I had little to no nausea and I only got a tiny bit emotional the week of my period.
2	170	Made me so nauseous
2	171	I began to feel very nauseous during my first non-hormone week (which I confused as morning sickness), so be aware of that.
2	172	I only was nauseous the first few days of taking it and then that disappeared.
2	173	I felt nauseous a lot.
2	174	No difference in mood swings and emotions.
2	175	I already have anxiety, so mood swings are normal, but I haven't noticed it being worse.
2	176	I crazy mood swings or depression like I got on other birth control pills.
2	177	Once I got on this medication I didn't really feel that many symptoms, EXCEPT for my mood swings.
2	178	I've been on this for 4 months now & one tip for you ladies: if you feel like you can overcome the depression and crazy mood swings, it is best to be safe and just get off of it.
2	179	Also had mood swings on it.
2	180	I had terrible mood swings to the point people were referring me to other brands.
2	181	Before getting on the pill, I had clear skin, regular periods, no PMS or crazy mood swings.
2	182	The only negative side effects I would say is that you sometimes may experience mood swings.
2	183	Mood swings were horrible at first then got manageable.
2	184	But after the initial two weeks passed I start feeling better no huge mood swings and I don't really feel any of the other side effects either which I'm happy about.
2	185	When I first started taking it, I had terrible mood swings and my period was terrible.
2	186	I also experienced crazy mood swings that caused major problems in my relationship.
2	187	Mood swings are a bit of a problem to where I will get upset with my boyfriend for not replying in a timely matter, over dumb stuff I get upset.
2	188	I suffer from PMS sooooo bad and mood swings.
2	189	Only issue was the severe mood swings it would give me (which is why I'm not on it).
2	190	It was my first brand of birth control that I had ever used, and I was very nervous.
2	191	So maybe this wasn't the right BC for me, but I am also now nervous to give any other BCs a try.
2	192	I found myself way more irritable on this BC then I've ever been my entire life, anxious to the point of debilitation.
2	193	But then I found myself crying all the time over seemingly nothing and it wasn't just simple tears I was always close to having anxiety attacks.
2	194	I had really bad anxiety...my heart would start pounding at random times for no reason....I would get extremely depressed and or really angry when it got close to my period....my eyes got super dry and my contacts were painful to wear..... And recently got off of it, for about 2 months now and I have a lot of side effects from quitting it as well.
2	195	I hate this pill, extreme depression, breast pain, moody, cry at everything.
3	1	I have very minimal acne it’s the same as when I wasn’t on BC .. just 1 or 2 small pimples before my period is supposed to start then they go right away.
3	2	My side effects were fluid retention (mostly in my chest which resolved after about 5 months on the pill) and acne.
3	3	I don't usually have acne and it would go away during my period week so I knew it was coming from the pill.
3	4	My sex drive has increased, my acne has almost completely cleared, it definitely increased my breast size by one cup, reduced my period bleeding and helped regulate, and I’m able to maintain a steady weight.
3	5	Unfortunately what it has given me is terrible acne, depression, day long lasting nausea, and the day before my period I had horrible pains in my right side from my belly button to the bottom of my pubic bone that I nearly went into the e.r.
3	6	I have been through a lot of rough patches with my health, involving ovarian cysts, hirustism, hormonal cystic acne, and painful and heavy periods.
3	7	I started this birth control 2 months ago and I have never had acne or skin problems and I'm getting small zits/bumps/acne around my chin and jawline and I've done a ton of research and it's hormonal.
3	8	My mood has definitely levelled off and I feel more calm overall I think than my last bc but I cannot stand getting this acne I'm developing.
3	9	I have been using this for about three or four months , I haven't had any major mood swings or major acne breakouts but I have been experiencing abnormally painful cramps and an extremely heavy flow.
3	10	I've not had any luck with it reducing acne, however, my period became completely regular.
3	11	My only complaints are the acne and my breasts grew so much and I'm having a hard time with how much they've grown so quick.
3	12	It would work perfect for me if it wasn't for the acne.
3	13	However, it has not helped my acne at all.
3	14	Other than that, I am obviously not pregnant, did not gain weight, never had problems with acne, and no nausea.
3	15	Cleared up my acne within a month or two; I don't get any cystic acne anymore.
3	16	I've lost weight and my acne has cleared up so drastically!
3	17	It gave me cystic acne and before my skin was clean.
3	18	It just seriously screwed up my face with cystic acne all around my chin and mouth area.
3	19	I never experienced side effects while on my old pill, but I had to change pills because the other one has more estrogen and is also for acne, which I don't have much of anymore.
3	20	I had a lot less acne while on Aviane, but small flare ups a day or two before my period.
3	21	I've had problems with acne before but it seems like it's pretty bad this time.
3	22	I'll probably post an update on my acne in a month or two.
3	23	Very slight improvement in my acne, made my breasts a little bigger, and helped increase my sex drive.
3	24	I have been taking it for the past 2 weeks, and the only side effects I've noticed are nausea, headaches, a little more tired then usual, slight more acne.
3	25	I never had any issues with an irregular period or acne, but my main side effect was moodiness.
3	26	I also noticed an increase in my acne the past two years.
3	27	(I've had adult acne) Only effect I felt was very mild nausea.
3	28	I've been super moody since I started Aviane, I haven't noticed any difference on my acne yet but I've only been on it for a month.
3	29	Didn't experience any acne or stomach nausea.
3	30	My acne hasn't been bad, but other than that I feel like I'm dying with these suckers.
3	31	Okay so I was on Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo before I started Aviane and I had AWFUL hormonal cystic acne along my jaw line.
3	32	I switched to Aviane in the attempt to control my acne.
3	33	I started taking Aviane 4 months ago and it caused me to have bad adult acne, little bumps all over my face.
3	34	The only symptoms I experienced during the first month was breast tenderness and clearer skin (I used to have adolescent acne).
3	35	never have I had an acne problem.
3	36	It led to near-constant nausea and severe adult acne.
3	37	It makes me way more irritable, I gained 30 pounds( and I'm a healthy person, I always watch what I eat  and I exercise ), my acne is worse, I'm moody, emotional, and more sad.
3	38	It caused me to be emotional almost all the time, I have very little patience, moods swings, I gained weight, it's tough to lose weight, I have constant headaches and my acne is horrible to the point of scarring.
3	39	I haven't experienced any acne or weight gain.
3	40	In addition to my uncontrollable emotions, this pill has caused severe migraines to the point of vomiting, increase in acne, sleep deprivation, and lack of motivation.
3	41	Before taking this pill, my acne was mild to moderate.
3	42	After one month of taking this pill my acne has been the worst it's ever been in my entire life.
3	43	I never used to get acne on my chin, but now my chin has erupted and looks slightly pizza-ish.
3	44	I have cystic acne like I never used to.
3	45	I wouldn't advise this pill to someone looking for a BC that will fix acne, because this certainly wasn't the case for me.
3	46	My acne also cleared up.
3	47	My acne and weight have stayed the same.
3	48	I had beautiful skin, with occasional pimples around my period but this made my skin have acne scars & break out every day.
3	49	Decreased sex drive, acne, and very depressed.
3	50	However, I did not gain weight, my acne was controlled, and I didn't get pregnant.
3	51	I have been on it for about 3 months now, and my acne is still worse than before I got on it, not that it's a big deal.
3	52	This birth control cleared up my acne, increased my cup size, and regulated my period.
3	53	Terrible, uncontrollable acne.
3	54	My acne I get on my chin is ok hasn't gotten better or worse.
3	55	I did see bad acne underneath my skin right after my first period but that lasted a day and since my skin has been clearer.
3	56	Aviane has cleared up my acne almost completely.
3	57	I used to suffer from mild acne and my skin is almost flawless.
3	58	So far have gotten break through bleeding, mood swings, now I am getting slight acne on my cheeks (I never have acne), also was experiencing vaginal burning and tenderness that has seemed to subside.
3	59	The one side effect I have had is terrible acne!
3	60	I've never even had acne on my cheeks.
3	61	I definitely have noticed that when on birth control I do not get acne, but when I am on it I usually have pimples.
3	62	No mood swings, short periods, no acne.
3	63	CONS: My acne is SO bad and getting worse.
3	64	I've been on Aviane for 3 months now, and I must say I have absolutely 'No' complaints, no weight gain, no mood swings, no dryness, and on the positive side, my moderate acne flares have greatly reduced, my face is less oily, and I have just about 2 new breakouts when on the placebo pills, unlike having a full blown breakout during my periods, I am very happy with this pill.
3	65	The only thing that has changed is I do have light acne as opposed to having no acne before.
3	66	My breasts have grown, and the only downside is that I get a little acne when I am on my period.
3	67	However, I have gained 20 pounds in the past two years, went from a 34 C to a 38 D (on the brink of DD), acne has stayed the same and I have experienced mood swings, anger, and depression.
3	68	Cons: vaginal dryness, vaginal sensitivity, very low sex drive, very bad acne.
3	69	After getting off of Ortho-tricylen Lo I switched over to several other generic brands of which my gyno recommended.. all of which had crazy side effects (break through spotting/bleeding, acne, rashes on my face, crazy mood swings).
3	70	My face isn't totally clear of acne and my period cramps/flow is only a little less, but this is a good pill if you just want the basics without altering your body.
3	71	My acne has gotten worse though...I usually only get one or two pimples, but now I have acne around my hairline, my nose, chin and chest.
3	72	I'm going to stick it out for a few more months to see how it goes; I've been using 5% benzoyl peroxide cream to help with the acne problem.
3	73	My acne is the worst it's ever been and I know Aviane caused the cystic acne on my chin every month.
3	74	No weight gain, no mood swings, improved but didn't get rid of acne but this can also be related to the fact that the dose was too low for me.
3	75	I started it to get rid of my acne, I had acne on my face, chest, and back.
3	76	Before starting this pill I had no problems with acne at all but for some reason this pill made me break out all the time and I couldn't control it at all.
3	77	At first it made me lose my appetite, but on the second month no side effects at all, no weight gain, acne or mood swings.
3	78	It's made my period 2 weeks early, given me CONSTANT yeast infections, acne, and causes me to sweat a lot.
3	79	No acne, no moodiness, no weight gain (I actually ended up going from 117 to 111 while on the pill for those of you who might be worried about weight gain as much as I was), no breast tenderness, or any substantial change in sex drive.
3	80	Only possible effect could be a tiny bit of acne, but more like an extra tiny pimple rather than a whole breakout.
3	81	Sore breasts, headaches, bad acne, now I'm on my period but the thing is I'm on day 5, I usually only bleed for 4 days.
3	82	I've never had acne and have started breaking out.
3	83	I do get more acne on my face during my period now than I did before, though and mood swings during week 3 can be extreme: crying for no reason, feeling anxious/overwhelmed, getting unreasonably angry and upset.
3	84	The worst side-effect for me is acne.
3	85	I'd hate to chance switching to something else that's worse, but if this acne doesn't subside, I'm going back to my doctor.
3	86	I originally started taking Aviane about 7 months ago because i had pretty bad acne.
3	87	I haven't gotten any mood swings, no weight gain and my acne has cleared up very quickly.
3	88	I've had no weight gain, no flare in acne, and not any unusual mood swings.
3	89	Was on Aviane for a year with no problem, switched to Ortho for 3 months and gained weight, got acne, and my sex drive DIED.
3	90	No breakthrough bleeding and no acne.
3	91	I haven't had any other side effects; no cramps, no weight gain, no acne, just abnormal lengthy bleeding.
3	92	My minimal acne is about the same, but during the first few months I noticed that Aviane cleared my skin up quite well.
3	93	During my periods when I stop taking Aviane, my acne might flare up a bit.
3	94	I originally went on birth control to help my acne, which it kind of has, but not as much as I'd hoped that it would.
3	95	The worst part about this pill is the insane acne that I got.
3	96	I'm now 8 months into it and breaking out like a teenager.
3	97	I'm on my second week of Aviane and my skin is breaking out sooooo bad, all over my face.
3	98	I've been on Aviane for 4 months now and at first there didn't seem to be much of any side effects but after the second month or so I started breaking out like crazy.
3	99	Within a couple of months of being on Aviane, my cheeks started breaking out really badly.
3	100	My periods were a lot longer, my cramps were very bad, and I started breaking out on my face.
3	101	My skin did change and I am breaking out, but it doesn't really bother me.
3	102	Also I am breaking out and I normally have clear skin.
3	103	So far I don't see any problems except I've been breaking out more than I should since I'm on birth control.
3	104	I've been having breakthrough bleeding and a few pimples here and there whenever I am about to start my period.
3	105	Also my skin would get pimples like crazy.
3	106	Before going on it, I had some pimples here and there but it was out of control with cystic pimples.
3	107	I've had no weight gain, hardly any spotting, and absolutely no pimples, lighter periods, a few mood swings.
3	108	Only dislike is I have gotten a few pimples and my period was like 9 days long.
3	109	Also, I've noticed a few more pimples around the time of my period, and a lot more emotional as well.
3	110	So far I have had no spotting just a few pimples here and there and NO major mood swings.
3	111	I am in sales and my chin is so broken out in huge pimples that it is making it painful for me to talk.
3	112	I have not gained weight, light and painless periods, same sex drive, not moody no zits no anything!
3	113	I had flawless skin on Orthro Tri-cyclen LO, but I will take zits over anything.
3	114	It is the third month now and I've gained 10 pounds, skin is dryer than a desert, horrible cramps, gassy and my nipples are so sore.
3	115	I have been bleeding non stop going on three weeks and the cramps and abdominal pain is unreal.
3	116	I can pinpoint it's start within a 32 hr range, and it has reduced my flow and cramps significantly.
3	117	Also whenever I am about to start my period I get depressed and I get really bad cramps.
3	118	I switched because I got weird cramps.
3	119	Since being on Aviane, I've been having cramps very often.
3	120	I am 23 years of age and this is the first BCP I was put on to treat my severe cramps.
3	121	Until my third week in 10 days before my period I started getting dark discharge heavily for a week on top of that I experienced cramps that weren't as painful as they usually are but still enough pain for me to feel uncomfortable and notice them.
3	122	I haven't experienced any other side affects, except breast tenderness and mild abdominal cramps.
3	123	When I take the inactive row of pills, my periods aren't as heavy and cramps are lighter.
3	124	I had intense cramps and felt down right miserable.
3	125	After a while, cramps weren't so bad.
3	126	Upon taking it during the first month, I experienced severe nausea, headaches and a HEAVY period with the worst cramps I have ever had.
3	127	Each month alternates with irregular bleeding (getting my period before the placebo pill week) with cramps which might be due to a wrong prescription.
3	128	My cramps went away and my period became shorter and lighter.
3	129	I was taking this pill to help me with my horrible heavy bleeding, cyst & horrible cramps but my period this month has been the worst one yet.
3	130	my cramps are horrible, the bleeding is just as heavy & i'm not passing clots!
3	131	It did its job with preventing pregnancy, but didn't help with my heavy period and painful cramps.
3	132	I will give this pill points because it did regulate my periods and lessened the severity of my cramps.
3	133	I took this pill for birth control, less cramps and a lighter period.
3	134	I have been taking this pill for about 2 months now and I can already see a difference in my flow its getting a lot lighter and I had very bad cramps before and now I have none at all.Also I this pill didn't cause me to gain any weight ,my weight has stayed the same and has even went a few  d but I'm not sure if it's  because of the pill.
3	135	I definitely lost some weight, my period was super light, lasted 3 days, no cramps and my skin cleared up amazingly.
3	136	I've experienced slight mood swings, less period cramps, and an increase in cup size(s).
3	137	I started this pill to help with my cramps because I would be in extreme pain from my periods.
3	138	Needless to say it fixed my cramps but caused me other problems.
3	139	My cramps are very minimal.
3	140	I have taken a few different birth controls and had a lot of problems with them (Apri-painful sharp pains during intercourse,cramps).
3	141	I do not have cramps ever, period lasts 3-4 days (not heavy), always comes the same day, pain has stopped, no weight gain, no cravings, no mood swings, nothing.
3	142	After that I was experiencing aura migraines, horrible painful cramps landing my in the ER.
3	143	This pill had no side effects didnt make me break out or get bigger breasts but it did make my cramps 5 times more painful than they normally are.
3	144	It's pretty light, but I get bad cramps that last for 2-4 days.
3	145	But on Aviane it has lasted 7 days and it's super heavy with cramps.
3	146	Negative side affects are that I have a huge appetite (thankfully a high metabolism) constant headaches, worse PMS, no motivation, tiredness, irrational mood swings, and last week I noticed breakthrough bleeding and cramps halfway through the pack.
3	147	I have occasional cramps but they are infrequent and only last a few seconds.
3	148	Got horrible headaches, gained weight, and cramps were horrible.
3	149	After 2 years of Lessina I begged to be switched back to Aviane, and now only after 2 months of taking it I have lost 11 lbs and the cramps and headaches are gone.
3	150	I do get tender breast while on my period but I rather have tender breast and moodiness and cramps!
3	151	I have also suffered from moderately severe periods, with cramps that made it impossible to go to work or school.
3	152	Pros: shorter and lighter period, and little to no cramps.
3	153	No mood swings, light period and mild cramps.
3	154	I was on it for a few weeks and started to get leg cramps.
3	155	The only thing that bothered me was the leg cramps, everything else seemed to be fine.
3	156	I had bad cramps but very light period.
3	157	I had the worst cramps yesterday.
3	158	The first week I had severe nausea, fatigue and cramps, the second week was fine aside from general moodiness, and then the first day of the third week I got my period and am now on day 9 of bleeding.
3	159	I did not experience any weight-gain or change in the length of my period, cramps, etc.
3	160	I have been on Aviane for 2 and a half weeks and have been extremely emotional, had breakthrough bleeding for almost a week now and have bad cramps and bloating.
3	161	I mean, granted, I haven't had any cramps, but this weight gain and mood swings at the beginning of summer is a no go for me.
3	162	I first got on it when I was experiencing terribly painful cramps that made me throw up.
3	163	No cramps at all, skin looked great, mood was fine.
3	164	However, when I was off the pill for a month, the painful cramps came back and I was vomiting.
3	165	I had super bad cramps and now I have none, my period is regular, complexion is clear.
3	166	I normally have my period for about 5 days, 3 heavy days and 2 light days, with minimal cramps, however this period has been going on for about 7 days now bleeding heavily the entire time, my breasts are in excruciating pain (my breasts normally hurt before I start my period not during my period).
3	167	I have had the worst cramps, dizziness, some headaches, and I haven't had an appetite.
3	168	No cramps, lighter periods.
3	169	I've started this pill 3 weeks ago, and I've had a headache the first three days and the end of the first week I had really bad cramps that I never had before.
3	170	A little bit of breast tenderness, few cramps.
3	171	On the other side periods are great, very light and no cramps or anything.
3	172	I hadn't noticed anything abnormal about my periods and I had less cramps.
3	173	I started on Aviane to stop my period for awhile: I get horrible cramps, and Advil had always been my go-to drug, but I was diagnosed with stomach perforations from taking it, so my gyn thought giving my body a break from my period might be a good idea.
3	174	On day 11, before I could even take my next pill I started my period very heavily with very painful cramps - I wasn't supposed to start for another 2 1/2 weeks (this is what I was put on the pill to control).
3	175	I've had NO abnormal bleeding - however when I'm on my period the first day, my cramps hurt a little more than usual.
3	176	I have lighter periods with no cramps, and I haven't gained any weight like everyone says you do when you go on the pill.
3	177	However, by year two I was having panic attacks, mind-boggling depression, horrible break-outs, and titanic cramps.
3	178	Plus, no cramps!
3	179	My moods are slightly more moody, but my cramps and periods are painless.
3	180	I used to get nauseous and dizzy when my period would start, and now, other than the occasional light cramping, it is hardly noticable.
3	181	I used to have cramping so bad on the first day of my period that I would throw up, but since I started aviane my period symptoms are practically non-existent (except for minor break outs on my face right before it starts but this was a symptom prior to taking aviane as well).
3	182	My 1st month in my third week, I started cramping.
3	183	Now my periods are 3-4 days long, my cramping no longer requires pain meds, and I'm no longer moody.
3	184	I get a half day of faint cramping and a little spotting.
3	185	My periods are still heavy and I do still experience the same amount of cramping I did when I was not on any birth control.
3	186	My period lasts 3-4 days with no cramping usually.
3	187	I started to break out on my face, no cramping, dryness around the vagina, no sex drive at all.
3	188	During the last two months, my breasts are constantly super sore and I have (mild but annoying) cramping every day.
3	189	I have experience heavy breakthrough bleeding during week 3 with painful cramping as well.
3	190	No weight gain at all, and after my third round of full packs, I had no cramping before my period, which is unheard of.
3	191	I don't notice any difference in cramping or bloating from before (I usually experience those on the first day and still do).
3	192	I've had very little breakthrough bleeding, but I did experience some strange cramping.
3	193	After a month or 2, during my 2nd week of pills, I started getting really bad cramping & back aches, & had to have frequent bowel movements(mostly in the middle of the night & the morning & took forever).I thought that because I had Ovarian Cysts before & this felt like them, it could be them again.
3	194	In the past week I have started noticing extreme anxiety and cramping (even though I'm not on my period).
3	195	I'm almost done with the first 3 weeks and in the last week I've had minor cramping and a little bit of spotting, but nothing I haven't been able to handle with no painkillers.
3	196	My period only lasts about 3 days, which is wonderful and moderate cramping.
3	197	They are light, short, and I have barely any cramping.
3	198	I was moody, crying all the time, angry, always hungry, bad cramping and depressed.
3	199	I experienced extreme bloating, weight gain, moodiness, crying for no reason, depression, sore ovaries, muscle cramping, back pain and a migraine headache!
3	200	I've had less cramping with periods as well as lighter periods.
3	201	I have no mood swings, my period is normal (can be crampy for the first day, but nothing too crazy), my sex drive is normal (definitely increased compared to Yaz!
3	202	NO issues except for very light spotting while taking the hormonal pills.
3	203	I have not had any side effects other than mood swings for the first week I went on it and spotting the week before I got my period.
3	204	I started spotting the day before my placebo pill, which was followed by extremely agonizing pain in my stomach & pelvic.
3	205	For 3 days I had spotting, and then it was like the flood gates opened on the 4th day.
3	206	And lastly, I did experience pretty heavy spotting a few days in; even though, I waited until the Sunday after my cycle to start.
3	207	I started spotting within a day of taking the pill...
3	208	I have been on aviane for 4 packs now and at first there was spotting for about the first three weeks.
3	209	Low sex drive and spotting are my number 1 issues when on the pill.
3	210	My period has actually gotten lighter and lighter as time goes on to basically just spotting.
3	211	Also, I have had a lot of abnormal spotting on this pill.
3	212	I'm almost finished my second pack and I haven't experienced any spotting or mood swings that anyone else has mentioned.
3	213	I experienced minimal spotting the 2nd month.
3	214	However, I am now switching to Yaz because this month I missed taking the pill by 1 hour, only 1 hour, and it caused me to have spotting, then resulted in getting my period while still taking active pills.
3	215	It kind of helped alleviate PMS but for some reason my body wouldn't listen to the pill and continued to have a monthly period well into the second three month span along with spotting.
3	216	My breasts are swollen, I still break out, and have had a lot of spotting initially but now I don't.
3	217	The first month I was spotting a bit but after that my period has been good.
3	218	I had some initial spotting which later turned into bleeding throughout my 3rd and 4th weeks.
3	219	I have been using Aviane for almost a year now and I would have to say that the only side effects I noticed was my skin has been a little bit more oily and I get 3 to 4 days of spotting before my regular period.
3	220	Have a little bit of spotting but I'm actually happy to be seeing that.
3	221	(Mmy sister started Loestrin last week and she's been spotting ever since).
3	222	Though I have noticed that my boobs hurt extremely bad and I have been spotting non stop the whole time.
3	223	I've had a little spotting but it's never that much and it never lasts for more than a couple of hours.
3	224	I took Aviane for only 10 days but in that time I gained a bit of weight, had severe migraines almost everyday, spotting and severe nausea.
3	225	I usually take it around the same time everyday which prevents spotting.
3	226	I've also had some irregular spotting  but I think this goes away after the first 1-3 months.
3	227	My period only last 5 days now, with no spotting whatsoever.
3	228	But what really bothers me is the week before I'm going to start my period I spot for about 2 days.
3	229	Since I'm single now am not sexually active right now I'm going to stop using Aviane to see if my dark spot problem clears up.
3	230	If I didn't take it at the exact same time every day, I would spot and after month 3 I bled for 2 weeks straight.
3	231	I'm constantly nauseous with a pounding headache, I'm dizzy all the time, and always in pain because it feels like my stomach acid spread throughout my entire rib cage.
3	232	I am on my first month now and I feel so ill. My nausea is extreme, I have had a headache for weeks and I'm very off balance.
3	233	I experienced no nausea, headaches, and zero mood swings.
3	234	The first one that I was on gave me severe headaches practically everyday.
3	235	Luckily with Aviane my headaches are gone.
3	236	At first I loved Aviane because my headaches went away.
3	237	The only reason I hate this is because of headaches.
3	238	It has helped against pregnancy, no gain weight, normal appetite, but the headaches were bad.
3	239	When I went on my other pills I didn't like them so I tried to switch back to those and noticed right away the headaches.
3	240	Also I've vomitted once and have been consistently nauseous and have headaches all day.
3	241	I've only been taking aviane for 2 and a half weeks, but so far the only side effect I have had was the first 3 days or so, I had mild to severe headaches the next morning, I take my pills at night.
3	242	Haven't had an headaches since then, i have noticed an increase in my sex drive, which isn't a bad thing
3	243	No mood swings, no headaches, etc.
3	244	Normally, I would get migraine headaches and nausea from other pills and/or nuva ring .
3	245	Also, I have been moody, anxious, and have had continuous night sweats and headaches.
3	246	I had really bad nausea and headaches.
3	247	I had regular periods (4-5 days and no irregular bleeding) and no mood swings, however I did always feel a lot hungrier but I didn't gain any weight and I would experience very frequent terrible headaches.
3	248	Other than that I would recommend this pill plus everyone is different so just because I had headaches don't mean you will.
3	249	When I didn't have migraines I had headaches and dizziness.
3	250	Also, I noticed myself being more moody and having side effects such as nausea and headaches.
3	251	I gained nearly 10lbs after using this for 6 weeks, I experienced constant nausea, occasional headaches, felt tired ALL of the time to the point of needing an afternoon nap, and extreme bloating.
3	252	So far I've noticed hair loss, which my doctor told me will eventually go away, headaches only in morning and before bed time, mood swings.
3	253	Negatives: my mood swings are extreme, I have gained weight, I get nauseous and have slight headaches, and my breasts are sore and seem to be bigger.
3	254	I also don't get as many headaches.
3	255	The first couple of months were going fantastic, but after that I noticed that I would cry and get emotional at the most ridiculous things and get more than my fair share of headaches.
3	256	I also got pretty bad headaches while on this birth control.
3	257	My breasts hurt, I get mood swings, headaches, a lot of nausea which in a way is good because I lost a few lbs instead of gaining weight.
3	258	I have horrible headaches and I get moody right around the time I start my period(s).
3	259	I would recommend this to anyone who can handle a few headaches and possible irregularity for the first few months.
3	260	I switched from reclipsen because it gave me a migraine every day, on the bright side this pill hasn't given me any.
3	261	So severe that I lost vision In my right eye before every migraine (aura).
3	262	Headaches stopped I have an occasional migraine towards the beginning but could be caused from stress as well.
3	263	Rare to get a migraine.
3	264	The breaking point was when I had a total PMS episode complete with migraine and heavy period about a month and a half into the second three months.
3	265	Then I switched to Lutera and I got a migraine everyday.
3	266	I haven't had a single migraine and I still have very short light periods that last about 2-3 days.
3	267	I started taking Aviane in April I switched to it from YAZ because it made me psycho with migraines every other day.
3	268	I had migraines on and off throughout the first month and they have gone away.
3	269	Also very bad migraines and severe nausea.
3	270	During my first week I had aura migraines, so bad that I vomitted at times.
3	271	I also suffered from at least 4 severe migraines while on this pill.
3	272	I also got migraines during the placebo week and had a lot of vaginal dryness.
3	273	Now that my body has adjusted, I feel normal again, no migraines, no mood swings, and no more dryness.
3	274	Heavy bleeding on a crazy schedule and hormonal migraines that hadn't existed with other birth control.
3	275	CONS: longer periods, migraines when on placebo.
3	276	Every birth control I have been on before has given me migraines and made me gain excessive amounts of weight.
3	277	I do get migraines which I got before I started the pill and nausea which are both tolerable.
3	278	Bigger breasts, fuller lips, no more hot flashes or night sweats, no more migraines and increased sex drive.
3	279	I have migraines triggered easily normally but this was ridiculous.
3	280	It caused me to break out everywhere, bloating, and migraines everyday I was on it!
3	281	Aviane made be feel excessively fatigued, and I still got the migraines.
3	282	It cleared up my skin to porcelain-like results within the first month, it regulated my cycle like clockwork, helped me shed unwanted weight, improved my sex drive, and even increased my breast size (bonus) from a small 34B to a full 34D cup.
3	283	I have no sex drive anymore.
3	284	Sex drive decreased and I get moody and irritable.
3	285	Side effects low sex drive, vaginal itching, weight gain.
3	286	The only side effect I have is a low sex drive.
3	287	Sex drive isn't high but I had issues with my sex drive before taking Aviane.
3	288	I completely lost my sex drive.
3	289	On the plus side, it hasn't affected my skin and my sex drive is normal.
3	290	Sex drive is normal, and my mood is the exact same.
3	291	Then I had an increased sex drive, but it quickly returned to normal after about a week.
3	292	I chose this pill over others due to the fact I read quite a few reviews and articles that said decreases sex drive was NOT a side effect of this pill.
3	293	On top of being miserable, sex drive has completely tanked.
3	294	I have been depressed, have had bad mood swings, absolutely no sex drive, my breasts are very tender, and seem larger and I know I've gained weight.
3	295	I started having sex with my husband around month 3 when we got married and I noticed a decrease in sex drive, a few heavy period days and a few light period days but they were always during the placebo week.
3	296	This has ruined my sex drive and made me very uncomfortable.
3	297	I'm a month and 4 days into pack 2 and I've had horrible anxiety, depression, decrease in sex drive, loss of appetite and nausea!
3	298	Great sex drive, no mood swings, normal periods and no babies yet!
3	299	My sex drive has decreased a little but I don't know if it's because of this pill as I don't really recall when my sex drive lessened.
3	300	Ruined my sex drive.
3	301	I still have a great sex drive and have had a great experience with this pill.
3	302	The only thing that has been a bit annoying is that my sex drive has increased, and my libido was high enough to start with.
3	303	My sex drive has decreased a bit, I have vaginal itching, burning and redness, and I find myself becoming frequently dizzy.
3	304	Also, very low sex drive like almost non existent, which could be a pro or con.
3	305	Oh and my sex drive is up the roof!
3	306	No weight gain, good sex drive.
3	307	Oh and sex drive increased 100%.
3	308	The only negative part about the medicine is that it has greatly lowered my sex drive, but I'm pretty sure most hormonal forms of birth control do that.
3	309	Nothing has changed as far as sex drive, sleeping fine, I have a bit of anxiety but I have had anxiety for a long time, not from the pill.
3	310	Sex drive has remained the same, possibly even increased slightly.
3	311	The real down side is a severely decreased sex drive (same response on Yaz) and it's affecting my relationship with my boyfriend.
3	312	I have a sex drive again and sex feels better than ever!
3	313	Was on Ortho Novum 7/7/7 for about 8 years until my sex drive started plummeting, then I was on Microgestin FE 1/20 for 3 years before I started missing periods, which isn't a horrible thing except for if you are in an intimate relationship and sexually active.
3	314	I am going to give it a few more weeks but might have to switch, along with these anger issues I also have absolutely no sex drive but otherwise this is a great bill control pill.
3	315	Plus I heard of it lessening your sex drive.
3	316	My sex drive has definitely increased from what it used to be.
3	317	My sex drive has decreased slightly but not too bad.
3	318	I felt so sick and had a very low almost no sex drive.
3	319	Other than that, no side effects - if anything, my sex drive might be a little better.
3	320	I am not able to lose weight and I've had a decrease in sex drive.
3	321	My sex drive has increased a lot.
3	322	I'm fine now, my sex drive has increased and my breasts fill bigger.
3	323	I am currently on Seasonique, which except for the slightly less sex drive, is AMAZING.
3	324	My sex drive has not gone down, my breasts do feel a little bit fuller than before.
3	325	I switched from a different pill that caused weight gain and loss of libido.
3	326	There are NO libido issues with Aviane, and I'm already down a few pounds.
3	327	I am 19 years old and I have been using Aviane for two weeks now and right away I noticed increased libido but major mood swings.
3	328	The reason I changed pills was because of decreased libido with Loestrin 24.
3	329	I noticed a little weight gain, and my breasts got bigger, but really other than that its been effective, affordable, and doesn't cause me stress or discomfort.
3	330	No weight gain, I actually lost a few pounds.
3	331	No weight gain, in fact lost 5 pounds but I was super aware of my eating habits since I didn't want to gain any.
3	332	The first week of taking it I experienced mood swings and weight gain but it settled after awhile.
3	333	I have experienced weight gain, increased anxiety and have had moderate depression.
3	334	I haven't noticed any weight gain yet, but I'm eating like crazy.
3	335	but no weight gain.
3	336	No weight gain, larger breasts, no mood swings...up until the last week of the month.
3	337	My period was normal, and I haven't experienced any major weight gain (gained a 1lb or 2) or loss.
3	338	Only minor issue is the small weight gain due to my increase in appetite.. other than that no complaints whatsoever!
3	339	No weight gain, no mood swings (by the second month), no breast changes, etc.
3	340	I've recently tried to get off of this birth control but I experienced immediate weight gain.
3	341	I have also noticed much more bloating and weight gain (about 5-7 pounds).
3	342	My face has stayed clear, but I can not deal with the sore breasts and weight gain.
3	343	I have been taking Aviane for two months now, I have not had any weight gain, still having some pimple issues, but I hope that will clear up in the next couple of months.
3	344	No weight gain.
3	345	No weight gain it makes my breasts a lot fuller and no bad side effects.
3	346	I have been on Aviane for about a year now and by far the worst side effect of it is the weight gain and breast tenderness.
3	347	I can't attribute my breast growth, skin clearing or weight gain to Aviane - all due to other factors.
3	348	I gain and lose weight pretty quickly so I would have known by now if it causes weight gain, and it doesn't.
3	349	After the first 2 weeks that went away, and I have had absolutely no side effects, no weight gain, no change in skin really, and mood stayed the same.
3	350	I've been using this medicine for about a month an its great, no side affects, no weight gain like others, and sadly no breast enlargement but overall its really good.
3	351	My mood swings are the best on this pill, and there is absolutely no weight gain or off balance of hormones where you feel the side effects of taking hormones.
3	352	But now I am no longer having that problem, no skin problems, no weight gain, and no mood swings.
3	353	As far as weight gain, I have not noticed any extra weight, working out maintains that.
3	354	Everything is normal, no weight gain.
3	355	No/very little weight gain.
3	356	I did notice an increased appetite but no significant weight gain.
3	357	So far I haven’t gained or lost any weight.
3	358	I can say I've definitely gained weight but I'm sure it had to do with many other factors as well.
3	359	I also feel hungry all the time and feel like I've gained weight.
3	360	I've been on this birth control for 3 months and have not gained a single pound.
3	361	I switched because this pill was much cheaper, now I know why.I gained over 5 pounds in only one pack (month).
3	362	So I had the mirena after my first daughter and had it again after my second but felt it was making me very moody and gained weight.
3	363	I gained very little weight when I began taking it, but quickly dropped the lbs when I started paying attention to how I was eating.
3	364	I constantly feel exhausted and although active, have gained 20 pounds in the past year.
3	365	I have always been a size 0 my whole life and weighed 100 pounds, after taking aviane pills I noticed I started eating a lot and gained 20 pounds within less than a year all the weight went to my belly and my neck it was awful and now I'm trying to lose the weight and of course I'm off
3	366	I had a problem with my appetite to begin with, gained some weight and dropped it shortly in the next coming months.
3	367	I have not gained any weight on Aviane and I have no mood swings and I have a lighter period!
3	368	I have gained 7 pounds despite doing crossfit 4 times a week, retaining fat around my mid section.
3	369	I gained 7lbs of water weight and thigh fat that makes my thighs rub together like no other.
3	370	I gained 10 lbs and was not happy about it.
3	371	I've never had trouble with my weight, but I gained 20lbs once I started taking this.
3	372	I gained 6 lbs on this pill in one month.
3	373	I haven't gained any weight either.
3	374	I feel like I may have gained weight due to an increased appetite but probably no more than 4-5 pounds which is worth not getting pregnant and having clear skin plus I'm fairly petite.
3	375	I also have not gained weight.
3	376	My boobs maybe got a little larger, and my skin did clear up, but I might have gained some weight over the months (I also stopped working out).
3	377	I gained a little bit of weight after starting Aviane, but not very much.
3	378	I never gained weight and my period have for the most part always been light.
3	379	However, I've gained 15 lbs on Aviane and my breasts have went up a cup size and I already had huge breast.
3	380	I gained 15 pounds (120lbs to 135).
3	381	Switched to the actual Yasmin but same thing, I gained around 40 pounds in less than 6 months and even stopped at the ER because of Ocella.
3	382	I switched because I gained 20 pounds in 6 months.
3	383	I gained 5 pounds in three months with this one, but the worst part was the absolute emotional roller coaster I was on.
3	384	I gained a lot of weight when I was on my other pill so my doctor but me on Aviane and I lost all the extra weight in less than a week.
3	385	I had to switch to a different brand for insurance purposes and immediately I gained 10 pounds and my breasts were extremely sore and swollen.
3	386	I haven't seemed to have gained any weight and my skin hasn't changed.
3	387	Never gained weight, never had mood swings, nothing.
3	388	I've gained 20 pounds in the last year, I feel frequently hungry, and more recently, bloated all the time.
3	389	I've gained an entire cup size which under any other circumstances would perhaps be nice but I already had larger breasts for my small frame and now they're just out of control.
3	390	I needed something to help me lose/maintain my weight after being on the Depo-provera shot (gained 20lbs).
3	391	I was on Depo-Provera shot for almost 3 years and I haven't had a period in 2 1/2 years and gained about 30 lbs.
3	392	I was on it for 2 months, I gained about 8lbs (and I'm short, so that's a ton of weight and a whole pant size), my mood swings were out of control, and my first period on it lasted for 8 days and my second is on day 6 right now.
3	393	Plus I've gained about 10 pounds from it.
3	394	I haven't gained or lost weight since I've been on it.
3	395	I have not gained weight, yes there can be a little bit of breakthrough bleeding in the first few months, but that is completely normal for acclimating physically to the pill.
3	396	I haven't gained any weight.
3	397	I have gained a few pounds earlier in my cycle than I usually do, but I'm not above my normal range before I started taking the pill.
3	398	I have gained weight, but I attribute it to the fact that I am no longer walking to school, and work a sedentary office job.
3	399	I gained 12-ish pounds while taking this, and I had crazy mood swings and emotional instability.
3	400	I took Aviane for 4 years and never gained weight.
3	401	I worked so hard to lose 100 lbs (242 lbs - 140 lbs), as if it wasn't already bad enough that I had gained 11 lbs prior to visiting the doctor, but now I am plus an additional 14 lbs.
3	402	I feel hungry all the time and have gained about 10 pounds and get very fatigued.
3	403	What I love best is I have not gained any weight as I have before on other pills.
3	404	I did experience nausea for the first week or so, but that went away.
3	405	I also would get constant, extreme, nausea at the same time every day.
3	406	The only side effect I have experienced is nausea, so all I did was take my pill around supper time and it went away.
3	407	I had one day of nausea and never had issues with it again.
3	408	I am also having extreme bouts of nausea.
3	409	So far this first month I experienced was a little bit of nausea & a lot of pelvic pain & it made me sooo hungry!
3	410	I began have SEVERE anxiety, constant ALL day nausea, and horrible mood swings.
3	411	No nausea or stomach pains.
3	412	I have had no nausea and perhaps a slight change in appetite where I eat a little more.
3	413	The only side effects I've had is slight nausea the first week I started taking them.
3	414	I take Aviane at night to sleep through the nausea (same on Yaz).
3	415	Even though there's still time I'm still worried I'm pregnant because of the nausea and fatigue.
3	416	I've been on this for about a week now, and so far I've experienced some nausea and I feel like crying at the drop of the hat.
3	417	I've already noticed some weight loss, and the nausea is starting to get better.
3	418	and I take it first thing in the morning with water and never got nausea.
3	419	I take my pill at night but haven't really had an nausea.
3	420	I decided to try to stick it out for three months to see if my body would adjust, but after a month and a half, I started vomiting and having such terrible nausea that it interfered with my daily life.
3	421	Last night, a few hours after the first dose I missed, I started having stressed breathing like I was having a panic attack, and I had to lay completely still on a couch for hours waiting for the nausea to subside.
3	422	I've been feeling nauseous and yesterday I vomited.
3	423	The first week of taking it I was extremely nauseous but that was the only side effect I noticed.
3	424	I have been feeling nauseous.
3	425	Sprintec made me nauseous whenever I took it and I couldn't take it without eating.
3	426	Each time I start a new pack I wind up nauseous and throwing up.
3	427	I've recently been feeling a little nauseous and tired, but other than that I've had no problems.
3	428	I have been on Aviane for about 3 years now, and the first 2 weeks or so I was very nauseous.
3	429	I'm occasionally nauseous in the mornings.
3	430	These pills caused me to have terrible stomach pains, go through nauseous periods all throughout the day, and have recurring dizziness.
3	431	However, I started feeling nauseous, which is extremely uncommon for me.
3	432	I would get dizzy after I ate.
3	433	I give it a 9/10, only because it makes me a little bit dizzy about half an hour after I take it.
3	434	Also I got dizzy after my 3rd day on the pill and occasionally get a bit off balance.
3	435	I'm 18 and I barely started taking Aviane and I noticed the first couple weeks I was always sad crying over everything and I would get dizzy, but I gave it a couple weeks to see if it would go away and I did.
3	436	Constant dizziness.
3	437	I did have some mood swings where I would just break into tears, but after that first week I haven't had any pains or mood swing.
3	438	I didn’t feel any side effects or change for at least 6 months but then I started to get mood swings.
3	439	And on top of that I have very bad mood swings.
3	440	I am constantly frustrated and angry for no reason; it's not mood swings, I'm just so mad all the time.
3	441	Now, I feel so much more stable and my depression and mood swings are gone.
3	442	I've noticed constant mood swings the week after my period or the first week of the pills so I sometimes double up to avoid the dip In hormones.
3	443	The first day I had crazy mood swings, but maybe it was placebo effect.
3	444	The only downside is that I experienced crazy mood swings the first 3 months of starting the medication, but it regulated itself and went away.
3	445	However, it did make me gain weight and get some pretty bad mood swings.
3	446	I began to pay attention to my moods and regulate my mood swings, which helped.
3	447	I am very sensitive to hormones, and the DEPO shot was not for me (crying, mood swings, feeling off).
3	448	I even was switched to Lutera two years ago when the pharmacy was out of Aviane and I immediately noticed the difference with mood swings, sadness, and vaginal sensitivity).
3	449	I've tried many birth control pills, but they all caused severe mood swings and depression.
3	450	I had mood swings I've never had before.
3	451	Emotional, bad mood swings.
3	452	HOWEVER, my mood swings are awful.
3	453	Mood swings were not as bad on this pill as when I was on ortho trycyclen low.
3	454	I didn't realize before but it made my mood swings crazy!
3	455	mood swings?
3	456	My mood swings have been crazy and have effected my relationship.
3	457	In the first few months I bad mood swings and depression states towards the last two weeks of the pack.
3	458	I had horrible mood swings and would cry at almost nothing fairly often.
3	459	I was only on the other kind for a month, because it made me crazy and I had awful mood swings.
3	460	I do not have any irregular mood swings on this pill.
3	461	The only issue that I could complain of would be slight mood swings from time to time, but honestly that's it for me.
3	462	I haven't had any mood swings or depression.
3	463	I had the worst mood swings of my life.
3	464	PROS: more optimistic, fewer mood swings, reduced symptoms of PCOS/irregular periods, clearer skin.
3	465	My breasts have become extra sensitive and seem much fuller than normal, my acne/ clearing of face seems the same as before taking the pill, but my mood swings have been the worst.
3	466	PROS: Short period, no mood swings.
3	467	Aviane is the first one that I've had no problems with so far... clear skin, no mood swings.
3	468	Mood swings are minimal but are nonetheless still there.
3	469	I had the worst mood swings and took it out on everyone around me.
3	470	After I was put on Seasonale I had TERRIBLE mood swings and I would cry everyday.
3	471	On the plus side, I did not gain weight, but I do experience a lot of mood swings.
3	472	I don't have any mood swings.
3	473	I'm also getting strange mood swings around my period (never experienced before).
3	474	My mood swings are SO much better--the Depo made me a demon, while Aviane only makes me slightly weepy right before my period.
3	475	The only down-side for me is the mood swings, but I noticed that it's manageable with a small cup of coffee; I feel better instantly.
3	476	I've had horrible mood swings and very emotional.
3	477	Aviane worked fine for a couple of months, but lately I've been noticing a lot of mood swings and I'm depressed all the time.
3	478	I like the pill a lot because I have not experienced any side effects at all, until my fiancee talked to me tonight about my mood swings.
3	479	I suddenly began to have bad PMS (which had never been a problem before), and the rest of the month I experienced unpredictable mood swings, BAD anxiety and extreme irritability (the brunt of most of which was borne by my unfortunate boyfriend).
3	480	The first week had little side effects, but my mood swings have been getting progressively worse throughout this month.
3	481	I did notice some major mood swings getting on or off the pill, but after about a month I think my hormones regulated back to normal.
3	482	Some little mood swings here and there but nothing that I can't handle.
3	483	Hardly any mood swings(nothing abnormal from when I have my period).
3	484	I'm on my 2nd week of taking Aviane, and so far I've been dealing with insanely annoying mood swings.
3	485	I've felt some occasional mood swings, but worse, my periods last for at least a week, and mid-cycle, my breasts are so tender and sore that I can't stand to go running.
3	486	I have been on Aviane for 3 months now and have had severe mood swings.
3	487	My boobs grew a half size, but it doesn't make up for the mood swings I've been having.
3	488	Some days my mood swings get worse; I find myself angrier at small things or I get depressed for no reason.
3	489	I do have severe mood swings quite often and my whole family tells me about it.
3	490	When I first started this, it gave me major mood swings but after about 2 weeks it stopped.
3	491	So far I haven't noticed any mood changes but I do have larger breasts now :) (which is always nice for someone of my previous size).
3	492	After reading such terrible reviews, I was nervous about taking this pill.
3	493	I did have like mini emotional episode 2 weeks in where I was anxious but it was only for 2 days and I haven't felt anything since.
3	494	Within a few days of starting this birth control I became numb, negative thoughts, anxious, extremely irritable and angry, which is all very unlike me.
3	495	I normally have anxiety, but this pill makes me constantly stressed.
3	496	Their pills didnt help at, and I had anxiety related side effects.
3	497	However, in the past year I began having severe anxiety attacks and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder after I began waking up in the mornings feeling faint and sick to my stomach, laying on the bathroom floor.
3	498	That developed into months of anxiety and panic disorder.
3	499	When I finally realized it was the bc causing my issues I stopped taking it and my anxiety went away.
3	500	The stomach sickness and constant hand shaking and anxiety feeling was enough for me to stop this mid packet!
3	501	However, with that said, i started getting horrible anxiety while on it.
3	502	I developed extreme anxiety to the point of panic attacks.
3	503	I've always been a social person but since I started the pill I've had the worst anxiety and paranoia.
3	504	I suffered from mild depression and overall stress and anxiety.
3	505	Went from semi normal emotionally to severely psychotic- depression, anxiety, thoughts of suicide, etc.
3	506	At first, I had a bit of anxiety, fatigue and restlessness but after the first couple days or the first week my body quickly adjusted.
3	507	Pretty bad breast tenderness and growth.
3	508	Tender breasts all the time.
3	509	I've been on Aviane for about 5 months and haven't experienced any negative side effects besides tender breasts around the time of my period, but other than that it's been fine.
3	510	However, only one month into taking the pill, I got my very first yeast infection.
3	511	I also used to get frequent yeast infections and BV but since starting this BC those break outs have occurred WAAAY less often.
3	512	I had a few yeast infections and vaginal dryness and nothing sucks more than telling your husband you can't because it hurts too much within the first month of marriage!
4	1	I have not gained any weight, seen an increase in acne, or felt any anxiety or depression as a result of the pill.
4	2	However, within the first month (close to her period) she was in severe pain: lower abdominal with back, shoulder, leg pains with tingling, headaches, dizziness, vomiting, 4lb weight gain (and she's very active), bloated, loss of appetite, acne around her mouth and chin and then all of a sudden the extreme depression and anxiety.
4	3	I started taking it to get my hormonal acne under control, but I think I'd rather deal with the acne than these side effects.
4	4	Now I have horrible acne on my shoulders, back and chin (which I've never had), constant breast pain, occasional random cramping, I bled the entire first month and I NEVER have any energy!
4	5	The negative side is that it has caused so much acne.
4	6	I never have had issues with acne, maybe a pimple here and there.
4	7	I have acne on my cheeks, big red pimples on my forehead, some of my chin... it's ridiculous.
4	8	Hopefully I still have very short/no periods but my acne will also clear up!
4	9	Actually lost weight and have less acne.
4	10	As a teen I never had acne or cramps, and once I became sexually active I started taking a different birth control for obvious reasons.
4	11	After 2 years with no problems, I went off it because I started getting acne.
4	12	I'm talking a full chinstrap of god awful acne for months.
4	13	Never gained weight/had cramps but I'm scared to go off it for acne's sake
4	14	I've never had acne besides the occasional pimple during my period.
4	15	In addition, acne has been uncontrollable and unpredictable, I have been bleeding more days than not since I've been using this pill (feels more like 3 weeks on, one week off), and I've been getting headaches and jitters.
4	16	In terms of acne, I had a pretty bad flare up, particularly for the first month.
4	17	I'm hopeful that it'll help clear up my acne overtime.
4	18	It caused me to have periods during week 2 of the pills, vaginal dryness!, a lot of hair loss & breakage, really bad embarrassing acne, weight gain, bloating, constant infections, PMS symptoms, etc.
4	19	I also struggled with acne in the "hormonal" region on my chin line and cheek area.
4	20	Nothing would help the acne.
4	21	I haven't encountered acne since my teens and had forgotten how awful and embarrassing it is.
4	22	I have awful cramps, heavy bleeding, sore breasts, acne, mood swings, etc.
4	23	I used to have regular breakouts around my period, heavy periods with bad cramping, and was really prone to ovarian cysts...blisovi completely cleared up my acne, my cramps are pretty much non exsistent, and haven't had ANY pain/ recent cysts.
4	24	The second month got a little better and I never experienced weight gain, acne or mood swings ( I don't think.
4	25	No cramps, no breast pain, very light flow, and no acne!
4	26	My top 3 complaints are: anxiety, acne, and weight gain.
4	27	Every month when I start Week 3 my face gets extremely dry overnight and peels as if I have a sunburn then cystic acne comes in full force.
4	28	I've never had an issue with acne in my entire life!
4	29	I was really worried about acne and weight gain as side effects.
4	30	No acne and I actually seem to be losing weight which is amazing.
4	31	She has been having headaches, breast tenderness and breakthrough bleeding and sudden outbreaks of acne!
4	32	Ever since I started taking this I have been getting bad acne along my jawline and I have become depressed to the point where I had to start taking medication for that too.
4	33	and my acne is bad but it was that way before the pill- Blisovi has made it neither better nor worse.
4	34	I haven't had this much acne on my face since I was a teenager, and I have gained SO much weight in my stomach.
4	35	I feel like I want to be sick almost every night and my acne is terrible.
4	36	I have been having stomach problems and getting bad acne breakouts all over!
4	37	I've never suffered with acne and I've been breaking out on the side of my face which is the hormonal area.
4	38	Not only that but my acne is the worst it's ever been my whole life.
4	39	I worked for 9 months to lose 30 pounds, now I am gaining weight for no reason, crying all the time for no reason, self doubting myself and my poor boyfriends love for me, AND BREAKING OUT which is why I got on birth control in the first place.
4	40	My face is always breaking out, except when I'm on my period (I'm assuming is because I'm on the placebo pill those 4 days).
4	41	And breaking out in my t-zone area.
4	42	Also breaking out horribly during the whole month (possible to be unrelated).
4	43	I have had no issues with my periods for years and now I am bleeding heavily, am very bloated and my face is suddenly breaking out.
4	44	I have been breaking out which I have never had to deal with and now my period won't stop.
4	45	I have a horrible breakout of pimples now too.
4	46	This med made my boobs grow and I had awful cramps.
4	47	I've never taken birth control before and I was given this by my doctor because I have heavy bleeding and menstrual cramps.
4	48	It took a solid three months for my periods to regulate, but since then they're really light (almost don't even need to wear a tampon) and little to no cramps.
4	49	My daughter was put on this for heaving bleeding and to say her personality has changed from this is an understatement.. she is moody/ depressed and highly emotional.. she has stomach cramps and has had panic attacks.... so happy I found this website.. taking her off of it immediately!
4	50	I was put on this to help with cramps that were too severe, they were causing me to vomit.
4	51	Only recently have my cramps become more painful.
4	52	I'm most likely going to be switched to something with a slightly higher dosage due to my cramps beginning to worsen, but this medication still helped me nonetheness.
4	53	The headaches are better than the crippling pain of cramps though.
4	54	No more cramps, bloating, or nausea.
4	55	My periods went from 7-9 days, extremely heavy & EXTREMELY BAD cramps to the point where I'd have miss work because  I wasn't able to stand.
4	56	Now they're 3 medium/light flow days, with light cramps.
4	57	I started taking this after 9 months of no birth control pill, but my periods and cramps were so bad I decided to go back on the pill.
4	58	This has been the worst BC I've been on, mood swings, cramps, terrible headaches, it is a total downer.
4	59	I've had bad constipation despite upping my intake of fiber to counter things and when it was time for my period, I didn't bleed but had severe cramps and backaches- basically all my PMS symptoms without bleeding which made me worried about being pregnant (I checked and am not).
4	60	I got my period with heavy bleeding on the second week of my first pack then continued to have cramps until the fourth week.
4	61	Since I been taking the blisovi my period has increased In length, cramps in intensity, and heaviness in bleeding, including clots.
4	62	When I started taking blistovi I had headaches and any birthcontrol for me never makes cramps go away except for micronor.
4	63	So I still had cramps.
4	64	I noticed that I am a whole lot less moody but the cramps prior to my period are more severe.
4	65	My cramps have been pretty bad too, the last heavy period I had my cramps lasted the entire week as opposed to going away the second day like they normally do.
4	66	I'm much more moody and anxious all the time and I have severe cramps on this pill, while I had none on lo loestrin.
4	67	But my periods have been better and shorter , no cramps, and no pregnancy
4	68	Very few side effects, & my cycle became regular, & cramps mild.
4	69	Went to pharmacy thinking I was picking up gildess and got blisovi fe 1.5/30, started it and immediately after starting it I had severe abodinal pains and cramps that we're keeping me up all night took it for 4 days and no relief.
4	70	My period is four days and extremely light and have little to no cramping.
4	71	Minimal cramping, and very light periods.
4	72	My anxiety has been thru the roof, I bloat the second I so much as look at salt, sleep is on & off, my breasts can get EXTREMELY tender & I no longer get my period at all but experience GOD AWFUL cramping & random spotting.
4	73	After switching to Blisovi though, I've had slightly more cramping, tender breasts, and gained about 15 pounds.
4	74	My period is 3 days, light cramping, and no noticeably different PMSing symptoms.
4	75	Even larger breasts, extreme tenderness, and so much cramping and pain!
4	76	Where my cycle had been light to non existent, never experienced cramping even before being on birth control, I have now been on Blisovi since the end of October 2016 and my cycle has gone haywire!
4	77	Sudden unexpected menstruation, including severe cramping is not the answer!
4	78	I have not experienced any negative side effects such as spotting or weight gain.
4	79	Since I've started this pill I probably have had 2 days of not spotting.
4	80	The plus side of this medication is that I have 2 day periods, none at all, or just some spotting.
4	81	I also experienced spotting for many months before it failed and I have never spotted before.
4	82	I have been chronically bloated, emotional, spotting, on top of which I am also experiencing a regular to heavy period.
4	83	I loved this brand, never had any spotting and my periods were always very light and short, and I never had any babies.
4	84	Other than that there were no bad side effects and I think it did its job well, I'm just forgetful and I forgot to take it a lot which led to spotting.
4	85	I have been on it for about 2 and a half months and for the first month I had light bleeding/ spotting almost every day.
4	86	The week of my period I did have one day of anxiety and some dizziness and light spotting but that was only one day, and my doctor said that was normal.
4	87	I was spotting in between periods and an emotional mess.
4	88	I've started experiencing spotting today, which lead me to this website.
4	89	I was worried about this at first but I consulted my doctor and she said that it's common for spotting to occur in the first few months of taking the pill.
4	90	I had spotting when I was supposed to have my period according to the pack.
4	91	It is light bleeding more like spotting so I am guessing this is breakthrough bleeding but I was curious as to how long will this last.
4	92	Despite what I eat or drink, The weight is piling on and I have been spotting every other week.
4	93	My moods are terrible and I spot now
4	94	I just can't stand not know if I'm going to spot and having to wear panty-liners everyday is really annoying.
4	95	I rarely spot between periods but have had a chronic problem with this since I started my second pack of Blisovi.
4	96	Horrible headache that stayed for the entire time on the pill.
4	97	I've had a headache (varying from severe to mild) every single day.
4	98	I'm tired, hungry, my back aches more than usual, gained about 10 pounds, broke out on my face, and this headache is a nightmare.
4	99	During my last cycle I was completely crazy, + also started having daily headaches.
4	100	I felt nauseous and bad headaches but that went away after a week.
4	101	I do think that it has caused me to have headaches nearly every night though.
4	102	When I restarted the pack after my week off I became nauseous and had headaches all day the first day taking it.
4	103	I was getting headaches, everyday with those.
4	104	My breasts and nipples are in extreme pain all day, bad headaches, and today I fainted.
4	105	I barely get headaches.
4	106	it seems the same except I've had a few headaches but that could be due to being sick the past two weeks.
4	107	I have had minor headaches, lots of fatigue and nausea, I was vomiting towards the end of finishing my first pack (horrible) I can't sleep at all, I find myself staying up until about 5 or 6 am until I force myself to lay down and sleep because if not I could stay up all night!
4	108	Automatically I experienced headaches everyday, tiredness to where I can't even move, mood swings, and I feel hungover everyday!
4	109	I was taking gildess fe 1/20 birth control and my pharmacist changed it since it was on recall and switched me over to Blisovi Fe 1/20 and it mucked everything up, I'm not too happy but I can't do much about it I haven't gotten my period so far, I have breast tenderness I have horrible headaches and I usually  never break out and so far I have since I switched my BC.
4	110	It made me very irritable and paranoid (I'm usually laid back to indifferent) and it has killed all sex drive I had.
4	111	My sex drive was low/nonexistent.
4	112	Also, sex drive is almost gone.
4	113	I am 19 years old and I have no sex drive and I blame this medication for it.
4	114	I haven't had a period in 5 months, gained 10 pounds, and libido is low.
4	115	The one way this pill prevented me from getting pregnant was by completely killing my libido.
4	116	I haven't noticed a weight gain yet but I feel bloaty and gross.
4	117	I've experienced weight gain, tender boobs and, a supper spotty period.
4	118	Within the first few months, I noticed a massive weight gain (15-20 pounds) that has been IMPOSSIBLE to get off with diet & exercise.
4	119	I did notice some weight gain, but it was minimal and I (luckily) was able to get it off.
4	120	Definitely noticed weight gain (10 lbs in 2 months!!!)
4	121	The biggest problem, however, is the weight gain!
4	122	A little bit of weight gain.
4	123	No mood effects that I've noticed, no abnormal weight gain.
4	124	In the months prior to Blisovi, I had worked so hard to lose around 10-12 lbs... 6 weeks into Blisovi and I've gained 8 lbs of it back.
4	125	I thought I was just getting older, but I have gained weight (10-15lbs) way faster than I ever have in the past and its hard to get off.
4	126	In a month and a half, I have gained 7-8 pounds.
4	127	Gained about 10 pounds taking this birth control, and I have never gained weight in my life.
4	128	I don't weigh myself very often so I'm not sure if I have gained weight, but my appetite has increased a ton and I am eating really unhealthily.
4	129	I went to the doctor for my yearly checkup and had gained 10 pounds in a year.
4	130	I gained 10 lb in the first month with Blisovi.
4	131	I've been the same weight for 5 years and all the sudden, I've gained all this weight.
4	132	The only downside is I gained 13 pounds the first three months of taking this birth control.
4	133	I have gained weight and have noticed irritability and tiredness.
4	134	I gained 10 lbs that I cannot seem to lose despite counting every calorie that I eat and working out to the point of nearly killing myself.
4	135	I've also gained 10 pounds with zero diet change.
4	136	I took this pill for 6 months and gained approximately 10 pounds.
4	137	I haven't gained weight but I feel like crap.
4	138	Like most people on this thread I've gained weight and thought it was from the holidays and vacations.
4	139	I've gained 15 lbs in the past 6 months without a lifestyle change.
4	140	I always had the clearest skin and now that I've been taking Blisovi I'll have random break outs and I've gained some weight as well.
4	141	My skin is fairly clear and I've gained about 5lbs which is a struggle for me to keep on weight (5 ft 106lbs).
4	142	I have gained weight and frequently have stabbing pain in abdomen and lower back, and severe painful bloating!!
4	143	I've gained a few pounds but that could be because I went from a 32C to now a 30DDD....my skin is about the same maybe a little less breakouts nothing bad at all
4	144	I've seriously gained 5 or more pounds this week
4	145	My breast have shrunk and have gained weight in my stomach which is the last thing a girl wants!
4	146	I've gained 10+ lbs in less than 2 months!!!
4	147	I have already gained five pounds.
4	148	After starting this pill I gained 10lbs, on my smaller frame it's insanely noticeable to the point I'm afraid someone will ask if I'm pregnant.
4	149	The ingredients are identical, but I've been on it a month and a half and have gained 6 pounds.
4	150	Since then the nausea comes and goes and its a terrible feeling.
4	151	I only had the mild side effects that are generally anticipated on any brand- slight nausea for the first few days and some discharge for a little more than the first week, and currently breast tenderness.
4	152	I experienced severe nausea the first day, but it quickly subsided within 24 hours.
4	153	At the beginning of each pack so far I've experienced horrible nausea.
4	154	The only side effects of taking it for me are sore breasts and occasional nausea, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons.
4	155	I agree with the others about extreme breast soreness and nausea during the first few days.
4	156	Developed severe nausea and started gaining weight.
4	157	I'm not sure if it's my anxiety or the pill causing my extreme nausea everyday.
4	158	Because of the nausea.
4	159	After just one week on the first pack of this, I had tremendous nausea to the point that I had to lay down countless times throughout the day.
4	160	The nausea is not as horrible but it is still there.
4	161	The second day on it about 30 minutes after taking it I was extremely nauseous.
4	162	I'm always nauseous and I'm unable to eat and as a result I've lost a ton of weight.
4	163	The third week of my first pack, I ended up throwing up and I have been nauseous non stop since starting this pill.
4	164	Earlier today I was speaking to a peer and all of a sudden broke out into an entire body sweat, got extremely light headed, and extremely nauseous.
4	165	I'm up 8-lbs since started, the waist in my pants are extremely tight, breast tenderness, i had a rash on my hip/abdomen for the first few weeks, and i get extremely nauseous in the mornings and evenings.
4	166	I've been dizzy every day - my mood is terrible - can't stop complaining about stupid things.
4	167	I get slightly hormonal with mood swings and depression.
4	168	Bloating, mood swings, boobs hurt, feel fat all the time and I don't know how long I'm gonna have my period!
4	169	My menstrual comes every other week , I'm always bloated , my mood swings are unbearable that my friendships and relationships are being affected by it my work performance is horrible as well seeing how I'm always tired and irritable and my sex life, forget about it.
4	170	Mood swings, super tired, the whole 9 yards!
4	171	I was on it for two months before realizing that it was almost certainly the cause of the severe anxiety, depression, and mood swings I'd been having for two months.
4	172	I had ridiculous mood swings and became very depressed.
4	173	My mood swings are the worst they've ever been and I find myself crying at the drop of a hat and mad at everything.
4	174	After reading so many of the negative reviews on here, I was extremely nervous and skeptical about starting the pill.
4	175	I was so nervous to start the pill, but I knew that everyone's body is different so I just had to try it, and EVERYTHING IS FINE.
4	176	I just finished the second week of my pack, so I can't say that I know I'm adjusted yet, but for anyone who is nervous like I was- don't be afraid to try it, you can always change it!
4	177	I read the reviews and I was so nervous but I still gave it a shot.
4	178	Not sure if it was life or the pill but I became anxious, moody, and depressed.
4	179	Ever since I've been extremely moody/irritable, it made me feel anxious and lethargic.
4	180	It also made me extremely anxious and depressed and exacerbated my pre-existing sleep problems.
4	181	There were days I couldn't function because my anxiety had gotten so high, and nothing was actually going on for me to be anxious about.
4	182	Since I've started this pill  I have experienced anxiety attacks, and constantly feeling sad, not me at all!
4	183	It also made me tired and lazy along with a spike in my anxiety.
4	184	I literally had an anxiety attack just trying to drive home.
4	185	The only real downfall was the week before my period, without fail, I would have really bad anxiety and be extremely emotional - way more than I normally was on Lomedia.
4	186	This pill has greatly increased my anxiety which I have normally, and I am a lot more emotional (I cry at almost anything now!).
4	187	I just started my third month and have so much stress and anxiety.
4	188	I've had panic attacks and my anxiety is almost unbearable.
4	189	I also had anxiety and lots of stress, I thought it was just the workload, but from the other reviews I have now learnt I am not the only one suffering from stress.
4	190	I get anxiety every time I go to the pharmacy now.
4	191	For the last few months I've been experiencing extreme anxiety to the point of jumping out of my skin.
4	192	My anxiety has been heightened to a point where I can't go outside at the risk of panicking, and I'm constantly very jittery/shaky.
4	193	I would not recommend this product for women experiencing any sort of depression or anxiety.
4	194	Since starting this b/c I've experienced intense headaches/severe sinus problems, vision problems, anxiety, sleep issues, bloating, sore/swollen hands & joints, very tender breasts, & feeling so lethergic.
4	195	Not only is my weight up but my face breaks out all the time and my anxiety as of late has been awful.
4	196	I started taking the this pill and after a little over a month I noticed I was getting highly depressed and high anxiety.
4	197	The only side affect is tender breasts for like a week.
4	198	I got a bad yeast infection after taking this and became sensitive to getting yeast infections (despite that I never had one in my life before this).
5	1	It even reduced my acne!
5	2	I gained 30 pounds in a year and my acne got worse after about 6 months.
5	3	The acne cleared up the first few months though.
5	4	So far; no weight gain, my acne cleared up, no pregnancy issues, my breast size has increased (yay!
5	5	I’ve been on chateal for almost 6 months and I love it so far, it cleared up my acne so now I can go out without makeup, I didn’t really gain weight but I haven’t been losing but it’s okay, my periods are exactly 28 days apart, my periods are light and cramps are like non existent, and best part I’m not pregnant!
5	6	First was acne, my skin is usually clear but this made me breakout a lot.
5	7	I haven't noticed either more or less acne than before.
5	8	but no acne or nauseous feelings
5	9	I have to say my acne has cleared up a bit and I haven't had any other bad symptoms.
5	10	Like really bad nausea, stomach pains, but the one that really bothered me was the acne.
5	11	I usually have really clear skin and only get acne when I'm about to start my period but ever since I started taking these, I break out like crazy!
5	12	However, it gave me horrible acne.
5	13	I have struggled with acne my whole life, mostly cystic, and after only a few days my face was covered far worse than I've ever had before.
5	14	I would say if you have cystic acne or are acne prone in general, do not use this product!
5	15	It will only make your acne worse.
5	16	I've have dealt with severe acne growing up and I have finally felt confident in my skin and body when I finally got it to go away.
5	17	When I got on this pill I saw acne all over my face almost the next morning.
5	18	I have been taking this pill for some time now, the first time I took it it cleared my acne, no weight gain except in my boobs went from a B to a C. Got off of it simply bc I ran out.
5	19	I think it's very effective as a birth control, no weight gain, I don't think it's effected my mood at all either, sex drive is fine, and Its even pretty good with controlling acne, I'm pretty happy with it and like it a lot more than what I was taking before
5	20	I wouldn't even wash my face for days and I still never got a pimple (I'm definitely prone to acne).
5	21	Now I constantly have acne and the pill I'm on now makes me spot.
5	22	Everything started off fine, my acne cleared up, my periods were lightened and I never got pregnant.
5	23	It did not cause me to gain weight and it helped my acne.
5	24	In the first month I did realize a bit more acne than usual, though this may have been due to stress as well.
5	25	In the later months, acne was not a problem.
5	26	This pill did clear my acne, but it took about six months.
5	27	I stopped it a year ago for a more natural method of B.C., but resumed taking it because my acne came back.
5	28	It really did help me by completely clearing my acne, this takes about 6 months though.
5	29	I stopped taking it bc I started using a more natural method of birth control, but started to take it bc I hate that my acne came back at age 28.
5	30	No acne.
5	31	I've been taking this for a month, I've never had acne before and now I do, I get really depressed and have breakdowns, I've been spotting for almost two weeks, and I've put on weight that is hard to lose!!!!
5	32	I took chateal for 3 months, I was depressed, got nauseous every day, get horrible headaches, gained 20 pounds, got horrible acne, had the worst cramps, lost my sex drive.
5	33	Stopped taking them 3 weeks ago, my acne is clearing up, my headaches are gone, my sex drive is back but I have been bleeding since I stopped taking them.
5	34	All horrible, especially regarding acne.
5	35	My face is kind of acne prone and it cleared up a little bit but not a whole lot.
5	36	Definitely works but it did leave me with some acne that took awhile to heal and if I happened to miss a pill I would bleed for a few days until my body got back on track.
5	37	I have been using it for about a year and just switched to monanessa in hopes of helping with my acne.
5	38	pretty decent birth control, didn't give me any benefits I still got acne that took forever to heal but it  is not as  bad as when I was on orthro tri cyclrn that one gave me horrible acne, also gave me headaches for like a week gonna switch back to thee patch cause it was the only that works for me and I'm done experimenting different pills lol
5	39	Acne never played a part in this as a side effect since I've never had a problem with acne.
5	40	I thought it would help clear up my acne.
5	41	I didn't have acne issues whatever before taking this medication and it just completely made me break out like never before.
5	42	For a 19 year old college student, you definitely don't want to have acne and mood swings.
5	43	I experienced weight gain (weight that won't go away no matter how much exercise I do), frequent acne break outs, and negative mood.
5	44	No weight gain, no extra acne, no horrible mood fluctuations.
5	45	I haven't experienced any acne or weight issues but my mood / attitude has been out of control.
5	46	Also I got super bad acne on my face never had any of these problems before the pill.
5	47	I haven't had any weight gain and I feel like my acne actually has gotten better.
5	48	I wasn't getting any acne or weight gain; however 3 months into taking this pill my periods suddenly stopped.
5	49	I've never had any side effects from my pills that I've used, I started with Diane when I was 18 because I had severe acne and it went away with the pills like two weeks after I started!
5	50	After a month went by I started getting acne which I never had, my mood swings were very uncontrollable, I became very very depressed, and very emotional.
5	51	Bad  idea, I've gained 20 pounds, something extremely unusual for me cause I had the same weight since I was 15 and I've been having acne episodes which is even more rare cause I never had it before either.
5	52	My biggest complaint for this is the acne!!!
5	53	Haven't had any acne or weight gain, but it did help regulate my period I haven't had any irregular spotting witch is great because I just switched from the depo shot.
5	54	I had a little nausea, and I do have fatigue, but my acne has been getting better.
5	55	No acne though.
5	56	Acne: I have always had acne (I'm 23) and birthcontrol has always helped.
5	57	Nuva Ring was the best for acne but after being off birth control for a year my acne went haywire.
5	58	I also had the fears of every girl: gaining weight, acne, mood swings, and the contraceptive failing.
5	59	On the bad side, this pill gave me the worst acne I have ever had.
5	60	It was long until I realized that it was this pill causing my acne.
5	61	Stopped taking it, and acne went away.
5	62	I also have pretty acne prone skin growing up but I hardly get any break outs now on this medication (not sure if it's the pill or getting older).
5	63	I had clear skin all my life, but when I got on the pill I suffered from bad acne.
5	64	Some days I get nausea in the morning...some days I can be moody and this time I have been breaking out like crazy.
5	65	The only issue I have sometimes is bloating & breaking out but it goes away.
5	66	I didnt have flawless skin before but I would rarely get pimples and since I switched to this they are all over me!
5	67	My cramps got worse on this pill too, they would start up to a week  before my period.
5	68	My cramps actually got worse on the pill but that was the only bad part.
5	69	A lot of nausea, headaches, really painful cramps last 30 seconds or so, but the worst has been my mental state.
5	70	Also it didn't help with my period cramps they are still very painful.
5	71	Anyways, I am now starting to get period type symptoms of tender breasts and cramps which those are easy for me to look passed and not worry to much about.
5	72	I'm constantly gassy whether its through burping or passing gas, stomach cramps & pain, back pain down in & near my pelvis, pain in my lower right abdomen.
5	73	The worst side effect I've gotten is the pains, I get really sharp pains on my sides around my hip bones or right above my uterus and it's not cramps they come out of no where and they are so painful I can't move.
5	74	I found that my cramps were virtually disappearing with less and less pain each month.
5	75	So far, the only thing I notice with this pill is that my cramps during the placebo week are WAAAAY worse than my cramps prior to taking chateal.
5	76	About 4 days, barely any cramps or mood changes.
5	77	I have stomach cramps every few days and sometimes really bad migraines, I hate these pills!
5	78	When it came time for me to get my period I missed it, then it came the next month with the worst cramps I have ever experienced.
5	79	I experience really bad cramps like going to the ER cramps and they got a little better but not like to the point where I have no cramps.
5	80	It kept me from getting pregnant, but gave me horrible cramps, even in between periods.
5	81	I used to have terrible migraines and unbearable cramps that on more than one occasion threatened to send me to the ER (and only didn't because I couldn't stand up and walk to the car to get there), and that all stopped when I got on birth control.
5	82	My periods are still the same length, they're heavier and my cramps are worse.
5	83	These pills definitely make my period shorter, lessen the pain of my cramps, and helped my ACNE.
5	84	Yes, it did serve it's purpose by preventing pregnancy, it did help regulate my period, and my cramps weren't as bad, however my face is literally a pepperoni face.
5	85	I skip my period every month due to my horrible cramps and no pill seems to help with them.
5	86	My periods stopped but I was still having cramps.
5	87	I used to have really bad cramps and heavy flow.
5	88	By the time the fourth month rolled around, I have gained almost 15 lbs, have the worst mood swings and cramps around my ovulation time, spot every week, and my period just keeps getting longer and longer.
5	89	I get severe cramps when I start my period and about a week and a half prior to starting my period.
5	90	I don't know if it's the pills that are causing this, but my periods on average last 10+ days and the bleeding is always very heavy and my bad cramps last at least 5 days.
5	91	And Severe cramps.
5	92	This is my first ever birth control, when I first started I had lots of cramping but nothing I wasn't used to before taking it.
5	93	I had an IUD put in last year and had it taken out within 2 months because I was consistently bleeding, got a rash all over my body and I had horrible cramping, but so far I haven't had any side effects with Chateal, yet.
5	94	Although I have no cramping anymore and my periods are only three days max there's lots of things I don't like.
5	95	Less cramping.
5	96	I was spotting and cramping and even tried to get my period and that was a mistake.
5	97	My cramping is gone and there has been no spotting at all.
5	98	I'm also cramping like crazy before my period.
5	99	One negative is that I got super crampy a week before my period & during up until the 3rd day then it stopped.
5	100	No spotting!
5	101	My periods last about 4 days, 2 days of heavyish bleeding and 2 days of spotting.
5	102	Worked really well for me until recently when I had spotting for like 7 weeks.
5	103	First week was fine than I started noticing my hair was getting thinner and started spotting brown dis charge for almost 3 weeks and started getting redder.
5	104	No weight gain, spotting, or mood swings.
5	105	All in all I did enjoy Chateal besides the spotting and mild mood swings.
5	106	So my Dr suggested I try this to see if my spotting would stop and at first I was hesitant to try it due to bad reviews I've read but I'm glad I tried it anyways because so far I don't have any negative reaction to it.
5	107	And it wasn't just a light spotting, but a steady flow.
5	108	Never had any side effects from this medication apart from some occasional spotting.
5	109	I was on another pill previously and it was okay except for the fact that I would spot ALL THE TIME, which got annoying.
5	110	I spotted for 2+ weeks.
5	111	Five because I never got pregnant, gained weight, spotted or lost my sex drive.
5	112	The only negative effect I get is the occasional headache.
5	113	Stopped taking it and have been headache free !
5	114	I also would get nausea and headaches.
5	115	I feel nauseous after every meal now and also get mild headaches.
5	116	Nevertheless, it was a little scare and I kinda have bad headaches but I was told after month 3 they would go away so I'm not really worried.
5	117	I have headaches, dizziness, an indigestion/heartburn type feeling -- I just have this bizarre feeling near my upper stomach/diaphragm, I can't even describe it.
5	118	I've had panic attacks, severe anxiety, a feeling of "blah", headaches and dizziness plus all around weirdness and I believe its from these pills.
5	119	I started this birth control when I was 18 and have been on it for about 8 months now once I first started it I was so nauseous and had horrible headaches.
5	120	Mild headaches, but they were daily.
5	121	This gave me headaches all the time.
5	122	No headaches, no increased appetite, no weight gain, no breast tenderness, I don't find myself really emotional, no pmsing which is great.
5	123	(never like that before) I always feel super bloated, headaches all the time, and I'm always tired.
5	124	This bc made me have severe migraine headaches that would not go away no matter what medicine I took.
5	125	I started taking this pill and about a week in my headaches were unbearable and then tonight I have vomited every 20 mins for hours.
5	126	Not very many side effects except from tiredness and a few headaches here and there.
5	127	The headaches are coming more frequent now but I am not sure as to if the birth control is causing this.
5	128	One being I'm always tired and get tired out really easily which is annoying because I'm always sleeping when I want to be with friends, another is  nausea I will feel sick occasionally and have headaches, and the last is being SUPER emotional, I will cry for no reason and I believe it has made me a little depressed.
5	129	No side effects like headaches, weight gain, or fatigue but I'm having extremely bad mood swings, constantly.
5	130	I also had extreme headaches, breast pain, and was virtually emotionless.
5	131	No more migraine
5	132	I never experienced weight gain, or migraines.
5	133	Cause awful awful awful migraines with auras.
5	134	As soon as I started back up -within 3 days migraines were back.
5	135	The migraines would come every month 3 to 1 days before my period started.
5	136	My sex drive was just fine, no change.
5	137	I have been taking this for about to months to see if it would help with the constant yi I was getting with my previous bc, it made it worse , I read some reviews before taking this and read alot of ppl going threw depression but thought to myself its not gonna happen to me , this made me depressed , to the point NOT wanting to commit suicide but thinking omg this is why ppl think about it , I hated my life and there is nothing in my life to be upset about and making this worse was this pill made me COMPLETELY lose my sex drive , no wonder the pill works because it makes not even have the erge to have sex , I stopped taking this pill , I wouldnt recommend this pill to anyone .
5	138	The only thing I do agree on my sex drive isn’t like before tho lol
5	139	However it did lower my sex drive and make me extremely apathetic.
5	140	My mental health was unstable (even my boyfriend noticed a dramatic change) and my sex drive seemed to diminish.
5	141	Good sex drive.
5	142	I bled for 6 months straight, my face broke out terribly and my sex drive was in the gutter.
5	143	And my sex drive went down a bit but not too bad.
5	144	Lost my sex drive, and got a yeast infection like immediately.
5	145	The biggest issue I had though, is my sex drive went completely away.
5	146	One comment I must make is that it did noticeably diminish my sex drive.
5	147	The pill has been effective in preventing pregnancy in two ways, one it's intended way, and two hardly any sex drive save for when I'm actually on my period.
5	148	But I’ve been very emotional (which I hate), my libido isn’t as high as it used to be, it’s difficult to orgasm sometimes (which I never had a problem with before this birth control), I also think I’m starting to lose some hair.
5	149	I have vaginal dryness, I have no period which makes me sketched out and my libido is low.
5	150	Also a decreased libido.
5	151	no weight gain, no  hair loss, no appetite increase/decrease.
5	152	This pill gave me no weight gain or loss, no breakouts, no abnormal symptoms.
5	153	Now for the bad stuff; discharge, horrible discharge every day.Acne, weight gain, mood changes, like so bad!
5	154	I have mood swings, weight gain in hips and thighs ( I'm a professional athlete and have never had weight there), increased appetite, and occasional bleeding.
5	155	I was emotionally stable, there wasn't any significant weight gain, and my periods were super predictable and manageable.
5	156	No weight gain though!
5	157	No weight gain etc.
5	158	Plus side to this pill for me was, no weight gain, lighter/shorter periods, did not cause breakouts, no pregnancy.
5	159	And no weight gain!
5	160	No weight gain, and I hope the mood swings are not as bad as I am naturally already a  moody person.
5	161	I really hope symptoms like depression, or weight gain do not begin to affect me as I am older now.
5	162	I experienced moderate weight gain - I am already pretty petite though so this did not bother me.
5	163	I been on Chateal since Oct 2015 and the only negative thing about it is the extreme weight gain...I a profession personal trainer, very athletic  eat a very well balance diet for my needs and I've gained about 12lbs...
5	164	I've been on it for almost a year and I haven't had a single pound of weight gain (I've been losing actually but that's because of diet and exercise but it's important that the pill isn't interfering).
5	165	My period comes like clock work, no scares, no hair loss, no weight gain, no mood swings.
5	166	I actually lost weight on this in the first year, to the point where I was underweight, and recently I have gained some back.
5	167	However, I've gained weight, it makes me very sleepy... like too sleepy to  tend to my 4 and 1 year old, my hair falls out BAD!
5	168	I've gained weight around my hips and thighs.
5	169	Plus I've gained SO MUCH WEIGHT from this pill.
5	170	I never felt like I gained a bunch of weight though and that made me happy and so I never really felt the need to change my bc.
5	171	I've gained about 15 pounds and after I take the pill I get so hungry.
5	172	I'm almost always feeling nauseous or bloaty and I can tell I've gained a lot of weight.
5	173	However, I feel as if it suppressed my metabolism and I gained about 15 pounds.
5	174	I've gained some weight, but I don't know if I can blame it on the pill.
5	175	I gained 12 pounds in less than two months.
5	176	I no happy at all  before Chateal I was on Orto 7/7/7 and on that pill I never gained weight, never had a problem and I had no need to get of it and go on some thing else.
5	177	Not to mention I gained 30 pounds.
5	178	I gained about 8 pounds which I did not like as I'm very self conscious and have a mild eating disorder.
5	179	I gained about ten pounds, a full cup size, and I felt constantly bloated.
5	180	I'm finishing my second month on Chateal and have gained weight, experienced extreme mood swings.
5	181	I gained a full cup size in my breast as well as about 10 pounds total.
5	182	No nausea as others reported and I take mine in the AM with food.
5	183	Within 2-3 weeks women were complaining about hair falling out, suicidal, nausea, mood swings, heavy bleeding and so forth and so forth.
5	184	I'm going on 7 weeks and haven't had not one of those symptoms with a slight exception of the nausea.
5	185	I honestly wouldn't recommend it birth control is tricky it's hit or miss and although I haven't gotten prego so far I felt like I was with the nausea and I have thrown up so I'm going to give give thumbs down
5	186	I'll wake up with extreme nausea and have to throw up I had sharp pains in my stomach.
5	187	Within the first week I had woken up with extreme nausea and eventually vomited.
5	188	Wicked nausea!
5	189	The mood swings and fatigue were nothing compared to the violent nausea I experienced when taking this pill.
5	190	Just a bit of nausea.
5	191	My boyfriend came in me once recently and I've been experiencing nausea lately, I'm not sure what it's from or if it's a sign of pregnancy..but I do trust that this pill will protect me from getting pregnant.
5	192	The nausea could be from the pill itself, which is what other people have been experiencing while on this pill.
5	193	Side effects for me could be depression and nausea.
5	194	You just have to ride out the initial side effect you feel, (if you do, everyone is different) Mood swings and nausea were my biggest side effects.
5	195	I have nausea, can't sleep, my knees are weak, my stomach hurts so bad.
5	196	I've been on this for almost a year and I've never had any issue except mild nausea before my period.
5	197	I've always had random nausea around the time of periods, so I cannot say Chateal is to blame.
5	198	I don't feel any nausea other people experienced either.
5	199	Every single month after my period I receive extreme uncontrollable nausea.
5	200	I've been on Chateal birth control pills for 3 weeks now and I've experienced constipation, fatigue, nausea, and really bad mood swings.
5	201	When I first started taking it I was skeptical, I was nauseous for the entire 1st month I was on it, it was really bad, but once I got used to it, about 4 months in my period became super regular, came on the night of the 4th pill every month since then and I loved that about this pill.
5	202	My previous prescription made me VERY nauseous, so I was prescribed a less strong pill.
5	203	It's been maybe 3 months & I don't feel moody, but I get nauseous badly once a week for about 15 minutes & then it goes away but I do think it has a lot to do with starting over.
5	204	The morning after the first day I took it I felt so nauseous.
5	205	At first I would get very very nauseous at night before bed, making it a little difficult to fall asleep.
5	206	I have never had any health problems or sensitivities whatsoever, I don't get nauseous easily so I guess those won't apply to me.
5	207	I get nauseous probably once every few days.
5	208	I'm on my second pack so far and if you read the reviews a lot of girls said they were nauseous.
5	209	Well that is accurate because I'm super nauseous very frequently.
5	210	I recently felt super nauseous, dizzy and felt like I was going to faint while driving but for no apparent reason.
5	211	And I no linger felt pain , I do still get slight nauseous around my period but no where near as bad as before.
5	212	Forcing myself to eat made me nauseous.
5	213	The first couple of weeks I felt nauseous almost everyday and just all around sick.
5	214	First few weeks I was especially nauseous but it went away in time.
5	215	Before I'd be nauseous to the point I'd sometimes throw up, stay up hours in so much abdominal pain.
5	216	I feel nauseous on it and threw up a few times and I slept until 1:30pm today (so I had about 13 hours of sleep, if not more, and I would've kept sleeping if my brother didn't wake me up) I still feel exhausted and can barely walk around without wanting to sit.
5	217	The pills had me dizzy and really bad mood swings!
5	218	After the first few months I really started to notice extreme mood swings and an overall change in my mood.
5	219	However the worst part of it all is the mood swings and emotions.
5	220	I've used a different brand before and suffered severe mood swings and night sweats which scared me from using pills for a long time.
5	221	I haven't agained weight or gotten mood swings.
5	222	I get very emotional and want to cry all the time for no reason I do have mood swings mostly when I'm about to start my period which is pretty normal.
5	223	But I had TERRIBLE mood swings.
5	224	I even asked my husband to help me track of any side effects that he may notice especially mood swings but he hasn't noticed anything either.
5	225	I have had crazy mood swings which has caused some issues between my boyfriend and me.
5	226	Also, I'm not much of an emotional person at all and had major mood swings and sometimes depression.
5	227	My mood swings were so awful, my boyfriend and I had constant non stop fighting that nearly brought us to the end of our relationship numerous times.
5	228	Mood swings galore, like you would not believe.
5	229	I experienced horrible mood swings and depression while taking this.
5	230	First, mood swings are out of control.
5	231	Mood swings?
5	232	It works as intended but during my period, my mood swings would be intense to the point of severe depression, irritability and suicidal thoughts.
5	233	I can't say I'm the most well adjusted person in the first place, but before I was on this, my mood swings were never this bad.
5	234	I haven't noticed any mood swings or any other side effects some people say they have.
5	235	I've only been taking this for a month and a half but the mood swings are uncontrollable!
5	236	Then in the second month I began to experience side affects: lethargy/"over-tiredness", and severe mood swings.
5	237	I have had mood swings in the past but nothing like when I started Chateal.
5	238	I've been on Chateal for 3 months now and I did not gain weight, nor did I get crazy mood swings.
5	239	Fatigue.I have really bad mood swings and I yell for no apparent reason.
5	240	I did have mood swings and did cry a lot the first week I was on the pill just because my body was getting used to it.
5	241	I am in my THIRD WEEK of the pill and have experienced extreme FATIGUE, mood swings as well as breast tenderness/shooting pain, and constipation.
5	242	It stopped the bleeding, and the only side effect that I have experienced is a slight mood change.
5	243	I just couldn't handle the mood changes and neither could my relationship.
5	244	My other symptoms were major mood changes including depression and anxiety, loss of interest in life/suicidal thoughts, tightness in chest, trouble sleeping, nightmares, sleep walking, and the irritability and anger/sadness.
5	245	No severe mood changes but I've been very tired and sleepy too.
5	246	My mood changed.
5	247	I was very nervous to start birth control but I'm glad they started me on this one.
5	248	I am starting it tomorrow and I am really growing increasingly nervous by every review I read.
5	249	I was very nervous at first because she said it would help with my size and because I have had chronic episodes of anemia.
5	250	It ruined my new relationship and turned me into an anxious depressed mess.
5	251	The first few weeks of taking Chateal were okay, I started to get more and more anxious as time went on and by the fourth week of taking this birth control I had a major panic attack/mental breakdown that sent me to the ER, I thought I was having a heart attack.
5	252	It also made me severely depressed and anxious.
5	253	My depression and anxiety would flare up the week prior and I would be exhausted the two days leading up to starting of it every month.
5	254	My anxiety is through the roof, I'm overly emotional & cry all the time.
5	255	By the third month, I started suffering anxiety and depression.
5	256	After quitting, I've finally started to get my life back and my anxiety is going away.
5	257	I'm normally a calm relaxed person, also my anxiety is extremely high.
5	258	I've been on this pill for 2 months now and have been experiencing breast pain.
6	1	Pros are short, light, and very regular period; no weight gain; reduced acne; and, above all, no pregnancies in my 6 years of using it!
6	2	The pill works great otherwise, absolutely no mood swings, no change in my mood/character at all, no acne, no weight gain or loss, no loss of appetite.
6	3	I get  PMS one week before my period, and I've noticed I get really depressed, emotional And get chin acne.
6	4	My acne didn't really change much, but it did help my deep cystic acne.
6	5	Now I just get those clusters of tiny acne around my placebo week.
6	6	I've always had acne and I can't say this helped tremendously when I was in high school and college, now that I'm in my mid 20s my acne is gone.
6	7	The pill changed everything no more constant headaches, no cramps or any menstrual symptoms, no acne, light flow 3-4 & no weight gain.
6	8	No weight gain or mood swings, but I've suffered from acne since I hit puberty and recently realized that my skin completely clears up during my placebo pill week.
6	9	No crazy hormones and no acne AT ALL.
6	10	Severe constipation started within 2 days after I started this pill (had been on low ovral for years prior, but currently unavailable),  acne followed, and now 5lb weight gain in past 3 weeks.
6	11	No acne or weight gain from me, as I've been reading about.
6	12	Gained about 15 pounds, had cystic acne around my periods, and my mood swings were unbelievable.
6	13	It's given me terrible acne and headaches.
6	14	I had nightmares for the first 3 weeks sore breasts after that and acne breakouts.
6	15	But don't be quick to give up the pill because of things like acne and sore breasts.
6	16	I've had acne all my life and had finally gotten it under control before starting Cryselle.
6	17	The first week I began taking it, I started to break out all over my face with extremely painful cystic acne.
6	18	I've lost weight, my periods are light and short & my acne is gone.
6	19	I used to get the worst acne on my chin but my face cleared up for the most part while on Cryselle.The first 1-2 weeks on it I was kind of nauseated and threw up once on the first week.
6	20	Bad: I took it for about a year, then it gave me bad acne that automatically cleared away when I took a 2 week break from it, and automatically came back when I got back on it.
6	21	I've also got awful period acne breakouts on Cryselle.
6	22	On this pill I had no acne problems, no weight gain no crampy periods.
6	23	It has caused me major mood swings (anger, and sad), pain in my breasts, and acne breakouts.
6	24	I have never had issues with acne even as a teen.
6	25	I've been on this for a month and a half and no progress in period or cramps, and I've never had worse acne than I do right now.
6	26	I hardly wear any make up and rarely ever get pimples and what started as a dry scaly rash type thing on my chin and jawline has one week later turned into burning red acne all over my face.
6	27	I've been on 2 pills, this one only makes me moody just before my period which is normal for someone not on birth control, no weight gained and my acne isn't awful.
6	28	By not awful I mean I've had acne for 7 years and in the past year on this medication it hasn't been as bad as it has been in the past.
6	29	I did however notice a slight improvement in my acne & did not have any weight gain.
6	30	After about a week I started having pretty severe mood swings and started getting the worst acne I've ever had.
6	31	I was put on cryselle to help regulate my cycle and clear up what was left of my acne and I have to tell you this is the worst experience of my life.
6	32	I had really bad cystic acne and went to a dermatologist and the medicine they gave me didn't help much so I went on Cryselle.
6	33	Was depressed all the time had terrible cystic acne and had the worse migraine headaches ever imaginable!
6	34	My acne has also increased a lot.
6	35	I had some acne before taking the pill, but this is the deep kind that can take weeks to heal, which I rarely got before.
6	36	The acne I got was pretty bad as well.
6	37	No break through bleeding, no crying jags, no acne, no weight gain.
6	38	Minimal side effects besides increased acne.
6	39	My skin was fine before, but I've been on this pill for just under a year now and in recent months have developed horrible, painful cystic acne.
6	40	It also helped a lot with my acne, while on the pill, I had no acne and very clear skin, but now that I'm off I wish I was still on the pill just for that reason.
6	41	I've had oily skin and moderate acne since puberty.
6	42	I've been using topical medicines to treat my acne for two years.
6	43	I was seriously hoping it would help lower my acne level though... but it gave me more, plus oily skin.
6	44	In the beginning it was fine except that my face was breaking out really bad.
6	45	I get horrible mood swings and I've been breaking out, not badly though.
6	46	My face, chest, and back are CONSTANTLY breaking out.
6	47	My face is a little blochy, red, oily and I am breaking out pretty badly now, since I started taking this birth control.
6	48	The only negative is that I sometimes breakout on my face a little bit before my period, but a few pimples over heavy bleeding and spotting in the past is no problem!
6	49	I used to get horrible cramps that often made me nauseous and that resulted in me missing several days of school just because of my period.
6	50	Since I've been on this birth control, my period changed from 5 days to 3 days and I bleed much lighter with mild to no cramps.
6	51	Some months I get cramps but they're not painful.
6	52	It normalized my cycle and helped my bad cramps and PCOS.
6	53	I had to miss school because of cramps.
6	54	I used to get really bad headaches before, horrible cramps & a heavy period twice a month.
6	55	My periods used to be 8-10 days and filled with unbearable cramps and heavy bleeding.
6	56	I experience little to no cramps with the pill which is amazing compared to what I used to deal with.
6	57	I can remember having to stay home from school because my cramps and bleeding were so severe it would make me sick.
6	58	I went from super heavy periods with unbearable cramps that lasted 6-7 days to light, painless periods that last 3 days.
6	59	Everything starts two weeks before, severe breast tenderness, uncontrollable mood swings, nausea, headaches, and slight stomach pains that aren't cramps.
6	60	I started this birth control a few days ago and been dealing with bad cramps, stomach pain, and tightness in my stomach when I yarn or cough.
6	61	My period had came way too early, it came like the second week starting the pills, lasted the rest of the month, cramps were so bad that they woke me up out of a dead sleep every 1-2 hours, nothing helped to ease the pain.
6	62	My first period on Cryselle was horrible, the cramps were awful but everyone's different.
6	63	My periods were also very heavy and accompanied by severe cramps and extreme fatigue and headaches.
6	64	My doctor recommended this pill to level out hormones and help with cramps.
6	65	I have NO cramps.
6	66	Like another user below, I was also on Lo-Ogestral since I was 17 for cramps and to regulate my period.
6	67	My period is 3-4 days long with no cramps...if it didn't come the same day every month I couldn't even tell when its coming.
6	68	The 1st month or so I didn't notice any changes but recently, about 3 months in I've been getting headaches, horrible nausea and stomach cramps & my period has gone back to being longer than shorter like it was on the first pill.
6	69	I have not gained any weight while on this pill and I'll skip my period every 2 months and they're very light with no cramps.
6	70	I have extremely bad cramps but I always have.
6	71	It is very light but I do have minor cramps.
6	72	I'm bleeding so heavy and the cramps are worse.
6	73	I had no weight gain, I had regular/short period with no cramps!
6	74	Ever since I started taking the Cryselle I have cramps constantly and always feel bloated.
6	75	No sex drive, bloating, cramping, nausea, fatigue and really greasy hair.
6	76	Perks were I didn't get pregnant and my periods were short and light, with no cramping.
6	77	Almost no cramping, sometimes none.
6	78	I'm back to my normal happy self, periods only last 1-2 days rarely any cramping.
6	79	They are still 6-7 days with heavy flow and lots of cramping.
6	80	Since switching to Cryselle, my periods are very light, I have very little cramping, my face has been clearer and I have been headache free.
6	81	I get horrible PMS as well and cramping that I believe is just not normal.
6	82	I've had less cramping and periods are normal.
6	83	My periods are lighter and I hardly have any cramping, when before they were horrible.
6	84	My main issue/concern is the spotting.
6	85	I'll start on Thursday be off by late Saturday with spotting on Sunday.
6	86	No side effects never experienced a headache (but I never get headaches prior) periods always come on the 3rd placebo pill day and last 2 days and the 3rd day is spotting.
6	87	It would start around my second week of pills and I would begin with all the pms symptom first.. Swollen breast, bloating, mood swings... Then I would have spotting for a day or two.
6	88	The spotting would go away but the pms symptoms would stay until I got my period at the scheduled time.
6	89	It also seemed to make my migraines worse (I have chronic migraine to begin with) & I had some consistent spotting & mood swings.
6	90	So Cryselle seemed like a God-send when the bleeding stopped and I had no spotting between periods.
6	91	I developed as I was taking the other birth control pills, many ovarian cysts which led to spotting and constant pain.
6	92	I recently just switched to this pill because I kept spotting and having heavy periods on the estrogen pills, but I have to say this pill is working great for me so far.
6	93	I started this pill a month ago and ever since then I've had spotting everyday bad headaches and oily skin.
6	94	And ever since I started taking this birth control I have gotten an odd abnormal redness to my face, Gained 15 pounds, and haven't had anything but spotting for the last 4 months.
6	95	I have been spotting irregularly ever since I started taking it.
6	96	But other than that this pill is good, I haven't gained any weight, I don't spot, I occasionally get mild headaches...
6	97	The only thing I dislike about it is I get very moody at times while on it,  if I skip a pill and have to double up on it the next night I get a real bad headache!
6	98	However towards the end of the month every day I either had a headache, had anxiety was very angry or miserably depressed.
6	99	Before Cryselle I was taking another birth control that made me nauseous, gave me headaches, and would give me 2 periods a month.
6	100	break through bleeding, headaches, anxiety attacks, weight gain,and my periods lasted 2 weeks.
6	101	Terrible headaches and nausea, I just got off of it so I'm hoping it all goes away soon.
6	102	I had severe fatigue and lack of energy, was physically exhausted and drained no matter how much sleep I got, my hair was falling out like crazy, I had water retention and headaches, I was irritable and moody and I had extremely low sex drive.
6	103	I had headaches and stomach pain constantly.
6	104	I was taken off the medicine when I reported to my doctor horrible headaches and seeing auras, which is a really bad sign of serious problems to come.
6	105	Sometimes it causes really nasty headaches behind my eyes due to my contact lenses.
6	106	Tricyclics give me bad migraines and I was on minastrin before this.
6	107	My sex drive did lower a tad in the beginning but now it’s back to normal.
6	108	Sex drive through the roof, not pregnant.
6	109	It has also completely taken away my sex drive, only reason I know this is because once my ex and I broke up I got off of it for four months and I was super horny, so uncontrollably horny, I wanted sex at all hours, but upon going back on it, I have zero desire for it.
6	110	It has made me severely irritable to put it nicely and because I have been bleeding so much my sex drive has also suffered.
6	111	Lately, I have been struggling with horrible anxiety (18 years old about to leave for college) and I have had awful nausea and low sex drive with my boyfriend.
6	112	I do not feel like myself, I'm really irritable, angry, depressed, & my sex drive is GONE.
6	113	My sex drive has decreased and that is my main concern because not only am I more dry, but I started crying after sex because I felt horrible.
6	114	I also don't have a sex drive.
6	115	I will be trying a new form of birth control to see if my mood changes along with my sex drive,  but I'm scared to try new things while by body adjusts.
6	116	I really love this birth control, but as someone else stated, I think it might be affecting my libido.
6	117	The only thing I've noticed is that my libido is higher during the placebo week.
6	118	I think birth control might kill libido a bit.
6	119	My mood swings are gone and I haven't had any side effects besides a decreased libido which I honestly don't mind.
6	120	I have experienced weight gain as well, which no girl cares for.
6	121	However, starting this pill I was miserable from extremely tender breasts, nausea, extreme emotions, and weight gain.
6	122	I haven't noticed any weight gain at all since I've been using this.
6	123	I have energy enough to exercise six days a week and have lost 30lbs since starting this pill in the last week of December, which is exciting because I had been unable, for years, to lose this pesky thyroid weight gain.
6	124	My previous birth control caused weight gain, had horrible mental side effects, and caused various other problems.
6	125	Only thing I noticed was a little bit of weight gain but that could also be from switching as the last birth control made me too sick to eat half the time.
6	126	So no weight gain.
6	127	I have been taking Cryselle for just over two years, and have been fighting depression, weight gain, terrible heafaches, and anxiety attacks for the entire duration.
6	128	It's been 3 and 1/2 months and I have had no side effects, no weight gain and my period is regular/short every month.
6	129	Besides the slight weight gain, this pill has been exceptionally good to me and will continue to take it.
6	130	Despite the weight gain this pill worked very well for me and I never had any other problems.
6	131	I've been on birth control for 10 years and have never gained weight, but within 6 weeks of starting this pill I gained 20lbs.
6	132	I was previously on minastrin 24 FE and I gained weight, and bled for three months straight.
6	133	This is the worst form of birth control I have ever been on, I gained 10 pounds in a month without changing my diet.
6	134	I switched to it 9 months ago, and since then I've gained about 15 lbs.
6	135	I have been on this pill for 9 months after pregnancy, I don't feel that I've gained any weight.
6	136	Now I feel my periods and gained 9 lbs.
6	137	My cycle was extremely heavy, I have gained five pounds in three days while on this pill which is very depressing.
6	138	I have little to no periods, the only place I gained weight was in my breasts so that's cool, and my mood has been so stable I barely PMS anymore.
6	139	I gained 4 pounds but that's also something that comes with it, just like either losing weight.
6	140	My skin is oily, I have really bad mood swings, I have gained 6 pounds and I'm constantly crying over any little thing.
6	141	Since starting this brand of birth control two years ago I have gained forty pounds.
6	142	My first 3 months were horrible with nausea and vomiting on the first 2 weeks of the pack.
6	143	My doctor warned me of feeling 'morning sickness' but the nausea subsided after the 3 months.
6	144	I still occasionally get some nausea but it's only if I missed a dose and had to take 2 on the same day.
6	145	I'm on Cryselle for about 2 weeks (I had to change the pills for a while) - I have constant nausea and dizziness.
6	146	The first pack u will experience nausea as any birth control pill because the hormones but should subside by the second pack.
6	147	Unsure if this is related to this medication, but there definitely seems to be a relation between it and the nausea.
6	148	I get so sick off of it, been on it for over two years and symptoms of nausea never subsided.
6	149	I've never been one to feel unmotivated, lethargic, depressed, or anxious, but as of recently I've been experiencing all those things which is no doubt making stress induced nausea worse and have just generally felt bad.
6	150	I had some serious nausea, even throwing up on one occasion.
6	151	At first, Cryselle made all the nausea go away and I lost weight.
6	152	The only downside to it is it will make you feel nauseous if you take it at night and my breasts are very tender and sore during my period.
6	153	I'm nauseous almost all the time now, with the mornings being the worst.
6	154	I cannot get rid of it, it makes me so nauseous that the thought of taking it nauseates me already.
6	155	I was very nauseous for the first few weeks but it subsided and seemed to be going great!
6	156	Minastrin always made me really sad for no reason, too nauseous to eat, very moody and depressed and had no period.
6	157	I was a little nauseous the first day I took it in May but it went away after a day.
6	158	The only thing that happens to me is the first few days of a new pack I get nauseous after taking the pill.
6	159	But I get nauseous easily.
6	160	My gynecologist made me double up on the pill, so it makes me extremely nauseous at times.
6	161	For months now I have been feeling achy and nauseous.
6	162	I have difficulties breathing, dizzy spells, huge cravings for junk food.
6	163	The only side effect I have is some dizziness.
6	164	Your body is trying to get used to the pill so that's why during the first month you may get some unpleasant side effects like mood swing and acne..
6	165	The side effects are mostly related to PMS, tender breasts, and some mood swings, but that could also just be me.
6	166	The first couple weeks I had some mood swings and cravings for food but it stopped after the first month.
6	167	My blood pressure, anxiety and mood swings also fluctuated when I was on and off this pill.
6	168	In the begin I got it wasn't awful I did experience mood swings at first and break through bleeding.
6	169	My mood swings have been terrible when I PMS and when I'm not PMSing, I feel blah.
6	170	I honestly had no idea people has such depression and mood swings from this pill.
6	171	I do have very bad mood swings, but I've always been kind of a moody person so it might just be me.
6	172	People have asked me numerous times if something is wrong due to my mood swings.
6	173	My skin has become horrible and I've had to start other medications to help my skin this last month, The mood swings are horrible and I will be switching to Yaz.
6	174	Overall I plan to stay on this pill until I can't deal with the mood swings anymore.
6	175	I do have mood swings that are sometimes crazy.
6	176	I thougth I would deal with that until about a week or so ago I started getting terrible mood swings.
6	177	Under Severe allergic reaction it states severe mood swings, depression, loss of appetite.
6	178	Until now, when I finally hit it on the head and realized all my weird mood swings and everything are from this pill.
6	179	I'm switching to Loryna because it has a lower dosage of progestin that should make me happier but I'm still nervous.
6	180	When I initially read the reviews on Cryselle back in May I was nervous to take it since not many women had a positive experience with it, but went ahead and tried it anyway.
6	181	I'm always depressed, most of the time I Wana  cry, it makes me feel really nervous , and I can't stand most people, feeling stressed.
6	182	I'm normally an anxious person and get hormonal around my period but this pill intensified everything.
6	183	I swear this pill made me so anxious.
6	184	I cried almost everyday and got angry over stupid things and I didn't have any anxiety free moments through out the day at all on this pill.
6	185	I don't know....I don't recommend this pill to someone who may struggle with anxiety or depression.
6	186	I am not sure if these are symptoms of my birth control or just anxiety.
6	187	After about 3 months, I tried to commit suicide, my depression has become debilitating, and I have anxiety attacks at the most random moments, without any triggers.
6	188	My anxiety was off the wall and my skin itched without a rash.
6	189	Worked and no breast tenderness.
6	190	I’ve been taking Cryselle for about a year now and there seems to be only ONE con: yeast infections.
6	191	My OBGYN told me that this could be possible but getting yeast infections every 3-5 months is not my favorite thing in the world.
6	192	Honestly if this pill didn’t make me prone to yeast infections it would be absolutely perfect.
7	1	I was recommended and given the shot to reduce the appearance of my acne (according to my clinic) and it made it 100x worse!
7	2	for anyone who has acne I do not recommend this.
7	3	I had little acne on my face and now I have tons of huge zits!
7	4	My symptoms consisted of feeling like I'm going to black out, and general dizziness, I also had terrible acne that did not go away even when I came off of the depo shot.
7	5	No acne, and my periods stopped after 6 months.
7	6	No significant weight gain, no acne, and absolutely no periods or spotting.
7	7	The first few months I felt really fatigued and got a lot of large acne flare ups and my appetite increased like crazy - I was never satisfied/full.
7	8	I had always had mild acne, but the Depo made it so much worse and just constant.
7	9	It did not help clear up my acne (existing hormone issue) but it is less of a hassle than the pill.
7	10	Gave me horrible head aches, acne that's so huge I look disgusting to even go out in public, pain on my right ovary 24/7 , made me super mad and angry to the point my bf broke up with me and I'm even off the shot now and still have pain on my ovary .
7	11	Weight gain, drowsiness, headaches, fatigue, awful acne, swelling in my legs and ankles for over a year, you name it I've experienced the side effect..
7	12	My anxiety has worsened, I'm depressed but the over all worst is the acne!
7	13	Cyst acne on my neck and chin.
7	14	I've never had acne not even as a teen.
7	15	I spent 80$ on acne meds!!!
7	16	Weight gain, acne (always near the end of the 12 week mark when you're due for another shot ) and I'm talking cystic acne, horrible horrible acne.
7	17	Additionally, my acne has worsened and I'm hungry all the time.
7	18	I have acne and I have never had acne as a teenager or an adult.
7	19	I always had acne but this shot made it worse.
7	20	Once I got my 2nd shot the bleeding went away, most of the side effects went away except for my acne it got worse.
7	21	If you have a history of acne & depression pls don't get this shot.
7	22	I started it at 20 years old and had never had any acne in my life and had never had any problems with my weight.
7	23	Didn't affect my weight at all, no mood swings, no acne changes, no change in sex drive, etc.
7	24	My acne tripled in severity.
7	25	Let me start by saying understand I absolutely hated this medicine.It made me gain tons of weight (60 lbs in the first 6 months), made hair grow darker on my body, acne, and lost every ounce of my sex drive (every single ounce).
7	26	I've never had a problem with acne but after a year and a half on depo I started getting pimples on my forehead that wouldn't ever go away.
7	27	I have been on it for 16 years when I just had my first child I was18, I have no menstruationl,  I have gained of course,  I feel upper stomach pains and was even being treated for ulcers and am endoscopy showed I didn't have ulcers, I have acne which does not seem to go, I have lost interest in sex etc...
7	28	Hair loss, weight gain, deforming cystic acne, hot flashes!
7	29	I'm not 10 months past my last shot and just beginning to see signs that my hair is growing in, my acne is getting better even though permanent scarring has already taken place.
7	30	Doctors don't tell you that you'll get osteoporosis,lose your hair, get acne, hot flashes and gain weight.
7	31	In addition, I've gained a little weight and had a huge increase in acne (again like being on your period X100).
7	32	I've had acne since I was 11 and since taking depo its cleared up a bit but don't know if it's from the depo.
7	33	I'm being treated for acne with Sprionolactone and my cystic acne came back with a vengeance.
7	34	I'm getting acne in places on my face where I never get acne.
7	35	(Advil, or heating pads) I also had really bad acne and no face wash would help.
7	36	After I started using depo all my cramps were gone I had no period, all my acne was gone, I definitely recommend this it changed my life.
7	37	I did not get any acne, but I've never had acne problems anyways.
7	38	My acne got worse at first, but I discovered cell salt #12 (srsly look it up #lifechanged) and my skin has never been better.
7	39	About a week before I was due for the second shot, I noticed an increase in my acne on my face, chest, and back as well as some spotting.
7	40	My acne has also gotten significantly worse and I have never struggled with acne like this before in my life - even as a teenager.
7	41	She has horrible acne, where she's never had it before, she's constantly tired despite getting more sleep per night than she has in years, and she's irritable and depressed.
7	42	No period yet so happy about that though and very easy to use acne has cleared up mood swings practically gone and have been generally happy!
7	43	I try about 3 different and I stopped because it was making my life horrible and then I tried the drop shot, I have not gained any weight(actually lost, just eating right and usual  exercise), my acne has cleared up a lot, I'm not moody AT ALL(it's amazing) and you just do it every 3 months.
7	44	My acne was minimal, mood swings were practically unchanged, and I actually lost weight.
7	45	Three months of bleeding, constant cramping, acne on my back (which I've never had in 24 years), and lightheadedness.
7	46	I went from having clear skin (rarely a zit) to the worst acne of my entire life all over my face and back, weight gain (while running 3-4 miles 5 times a week), and non stop spotting and two week long periods.
7	47	My entire face is now covered with acne and my back.
7	48	It is now super oily and I have moderate acne, which flares up badly every time I get the shot.
7	49	If I wanted to be covered in acne, moody and in pain, I would have just gone out and gotten pregnant!
7	50	My skin broke out in severe acne, my breasts were constantly sore, my moods were irregular, I was more prone to soreness during intercourse and worst of all I experienced moderate spotting for two ouy of the three months of each shot period.
7	51	I started to lose a ton of weight due to depression, acne was awful, & I had a period for 3 months straight.
7	52	My acne got slightly worse but I also lost about 10 pounds since I've been on it.
7	53	Good method of birth control as you only get a shot once every three months and I didn't experience any birth control failures, acne, weight gain, or periods/spotting whatsoever in the four and a half years I used this method.
7	54	I've never had an acne problem, but now my face breaks out terribly too.
7	55	In less than 3 months on depo I gained almost 10 pounds, I now have cystic acne on my face and back, and my hormones are entirely out of whack.
7	56	I've had the worst acne break out.
7	57	The only negative was I have had some acne return, it's nothing that a touch of makeup can't fix...
7	58	The second shot, however, increased my acne, caused mood swings, caused lots of breakthrough bleeding (especially after sex and during intense exercise) and worst of all made sex painful!!!
7	59	I never broke out in the past, but since starting the shot, my acne has been awful.
7	60	I get acne on an off an have mood swings .
7	61	Since I got the shot, I have experienced severe fatigue, 1-3 hour long headaches, appetite issues, inability to get out of bed, and horrible cystic acne.
7	62	I've been on the shot for about seven months now, and haven't experienced any of negative side effects that I'd heard horror stories about (no weight gain, no unusual acne, no unusual hair growth, no significant appetite changes, etc).
7	63	The acne seems to increase a lot, even in unusual areas like my scalp.
7	64	I switched from a hormonal contraceptive to Depo Provera January of 2013, never had any problems (weight gain, acne, irregular bleeding) for the first year and a half and only bled about a week or two before my next shot was due.
7	65	Cleared up my acne, have plenty of libido.
7	66	I used to be on the pill and it made my periods irregular, made me gain a crazy amount of weight, made my acne worsen, made me super emotional all the time, and many other bad side effects.
7	67	Within the 2 shots I started noticing acne, headaches all the time, and lots of anxiety/fatigue/dizziness and I find myself being hungry all the time.
7	68	I have not had any bleeding but the acne and headaches, anxiousness, dizziness, and fatigue are all still happening.
7	69	I had this Depo for two years and as much as it was easier with no pill no period etc it ended up the worst thing I've ever had I have developed cystic acne hard nodular lumps under my skin which have left me depressed with how they look.
7	70	I've never had acne and I cannot seem to get rid of it.
7	71	All that being said, this will be my last cycle as the convenience is not worth brittle bones or a face full of acne.
7	72	I have not had any side effects from Depo-Provera, no acne, hair loss, weight gain, etc.
7	73	The only downside was I got a bunch of acne and a bit of hair loss.
7	74	Now that I am off my acne cleared up a bit.
7	75	Perhaps a slight increase in acne but hardly anything to complain about.
7	76	I've had some slight acne but happy to manage that - overall for me it's been great.
7	77	So far I haven't noticed any significant weight gain, the only side effects I've had are headaches for about the first week after getting the shot and I started getting acne on my face.
7	78	I've never had acne, so this was kind of disappointing for me.
7	79	I was getting acne on my back, which I never got before and was really insecure about, and my periods were getting longer.
7	80	I didn't experience weight gain, I actually lost weight after taking the shot but I did experience some acne which I am not sure is because of the Depo or just minor adult acne.
7	81	The worst part, gave me the most ridiculous acne of my life.
7	82	And I'm waiting for the dark spots from my acne from months ago to disappear.
7	83	My acne got out of control and I had break outs in areas that I didn't normally have issues with.
7	84	I have not had any trouble with acne or weight gain.
7	85	Also, I had really bad acne the whole time it was in my system when normally I don't have acne at all and I don't just mean a couple of pimples...it was like deep acne which left me with scars on my face.
7	86	But I can say my sex drive is high, I don't gain weight, I don't get acne what so ever if anything it has helped.
7	87	Also, I experienced severe acne.
7	88	I went from having a break out maybe, once a month, to my face being covered in acne.
7	89	I haven't had any weight gain but my acne has gotten a lot worse.
7	90	I have been on the shot for almost 4 months and have started spotting very little and acne on my back, migraines and wicked cramps.
7	91	I developed acne I never had before.
7	92	I have been on Depo for two months, have not had a period, my acne cleared up, and I lost two pounds.
7	93	I also had heard that birth control helped with acne and it hasn't helped at all.
7	94	Yes I break out but its not absolutely horrible and I kind of always have had acne.
7	95	I loved it, had no periods, no side effects, no increase in acne.
7	96	The Depo has also made me gain twenty pounds and I have acne as well.
7	97	I also have acne that won't go away no matter what I use.
7	98	I usually have a very high sex drive during the 1st month and 1/2, I always have acne, always have mood swings and depression, sometimes I get headaches, and I gain weight continuously regardless of diet and exercise.
7	99	Never had acne before, now I do and definitely gained weight.
7	100	The only thing I am considering switching for is that I got really bad acne.
7	101	I asked the nurse that gives me the shot if that was from the shot and she said no it does not cause acne, but I never had acne like this before.
7	102	But I think worst of all was that I had terrible acne.
7	103	I've never had acne like this.
7	104	My acne is still there but seems to be getting a little better.
7	105	After a month I had heavy bleeding was no longer able to lose weight started breaking out and had horrible cramps.
7	106	was breaking out throughout the 3 months and in places that I never used to break out in.
7	107	I also am breaking out in places I normally don't like in my neck line and forehead.
7	108	My face started breaking out, not badly, but enough for people to notice.
7	109	But from having 100% blemish free skin to a few pimples is a little annoying.
7	110	Until then, I'll deal with a couple pimples and enjoy my skinny, period free life:)
7	111	The reason I got on it to begin was due to my terrible cramps and now I have none.
7	112	Not having a period with cramps every month was great but I'd rather deal with that than constant spotting.
7	113	In many ways, it was perfect for me- it completely stopped my periods, which was so convenient, and I had no cramps or pain at all.
7	114	No cramps, PMS, never wear  tampons or pads anymore.
7	115	I used to have a very painful first day of my period (bad cramps, diarrhea, gas, vomiting) but once I experienced my period on the shot I just had cramps but no blood.
7	116	I had the IUD, and got it taken out due to severe cramps and other issues.
7	117	It definitely helped with my cramps and bleeding, but these mood swings are unbearable and I can't tolerate it.
7	118	constant headaches, tiredness, stomach cramps, heartburn, feel dizzy and weak, nausea.. and the hunger!
7	119	I woke up having horrible cramps, then it led to blood clots with grayish tissue looking stuff inside, it was nothing I've ever seen before, I passed about 6 of those then the pain started to be mild again and easier to deal with.
7	120	I am getting very emotional about this entire situation because my periods are the worst, heavy bleeding, cramps are just unbelievable, so painful and lately they have been off track, but they still come EVERY month.
7	121	The first 2 months of having it, I had serious blood clots and cramps something serious.
7	122	My periods lasted 8 days and cramps were horrible before the shot so it wasn't that big of a deal for me.
7	123	The first 2 shots (six months) were the worst -I experienced bad vaginal dryness which made intercourse painful, and the first & last period I had was horrible - heavy bleeding, kind of chunky, with severe migraine and cramps.
7	124	My cramps are gone and I had a little bit of spotting on my first shot but that was normal but now I don't get any bleeding and feel wonderful.
7	125	Spotting during your first shot is actually normal.. the shot is trying to force the periods to stop which will cause cramps so its normal!
7	126	I actually went through hell with having the pill (had to change to 4 different contraceptive pills in 18 months) due to heavy bleeding and horrible cramps that would last up to 3-5 weeks at a time even after settling with puberty it was horrible.
7	127	I bleed heavily  7 days straight, ridiculous cramps and migraines.
7	128	No more cramps!
7	129	I may get light cramps for a day.
7	130	I am 13 years old and I used to have horrible cramps to the point where I would wake up in the middle of the night screaming in pain nothing would help.
7	131	I only got on the shot because I had really bad migraines and really bad cramps.
7	132	I have all the period symptoms (cramps, emotions out of whack, retaining water and horrible craving for sweets) and irregular bleeding.
7	133	However, throughout the years I still had some mild cramps and horrid mood swings and my right knee seemed to gradually get worse.
7	134	Best of all, My bleeding and cramps from hell finally went away.
7	135	It was convenient, just a few cramps here and their.
7	136	I'm 19 I've been on depo for 3 years and I LOVE it I didn't have periods , skin problems or hair loss my only problem is I have slight cramps here and there but nothing major but I've recently missed my shot and I feel crazy idk what it is but my period came back immediately
7	137	Also very horrible cramps
7	138	But I still have cramps from time to time....
7	139	I know a lot of people get bad side effects but I got none, I got no bleeding and my periods have stopped completely which is a bonus as I used get extremely bad cramps.
7	140	I had a really large clot  once along with killer cramps.
7	141	It also decreased my period cramps.
7	142	Bleeding every day, decrease in my sex drive and it even hurts to have intercourse, and cramps here and there.
7	143	Today, at this very moment, I am experiencing extreme cramps.
7	144	The only good thing about the shot is that it calmed my cramps when I had my period.
7	145	After the third there was nothing, but occasional cramps.
7	146	I switched because I always forgot to take my pill and I have a very heavy period with unbearable cramps.
7	147	Incapacitated by the painful cramps and back pain, mood swings.
7	148	After getting the shot while I was on my period , not a week later I bled like I never have , cramps so bad I can't get out of bed my entire body hurts .
7	149	It has been amazing not having a period for 5 years, no cramps, spotting or anything.
7	150	I don't think I will get another shot if the bleeding doesn't stop soon and the cramps r painful.
7	151	I don't have periods at all.. only spotted for a couple of week for the first month and a few days before my last shot.. my cramps aren't as bad as they were before I started the shot.. the only thing I notice I can relate to on the other women's post is my emotions are slightly unstable..
7	152	I got horrible headaches stomach cramps and horrible mood swings mostly anger.
7	153	Despite the shot every three months I don't have my period, mood swings, or cramps.
7	154	I've been on it 1.5 months and I havent stopped bleeding for 12 days, today HUGE clots started coming out and the cramps?
7	155	I had horrible cramps and long heavy periods before I started the shot.
7	156	I no longet get cramps, i dont crave junk food or sook at 'that time of the month'.
7	157	After 2.5 months, there is no bleeding and no cramps.
7	158	No weight gain , no depression, no cramps .
7	159	Terrible back aches, cramps, mood swings, when I first started out I had depression but its worse now to the point where I have suicidal thoughts, the worst pain in my bones that wouldn't let me do simple things like bend over to pick something up, get out of bed, or pick up my nephew and I got my period 2 weeks ago, at the end of September and I still have it now in the beginning of October as heavy as ever.
7	160	Periods were light with light cramps (compared to when I wasn't on birth control and had severe cramps).
7	161	I do sometimes get small cramps but they are nothing like they were and they're only around the time I should be on.
7	162	I have bad cramps, and lots of hot flashes.
7	163	the best part was the fact that I never had any cramps but I bled for over 2 years straight and didn't have a regular cycle intill reaching the 3rd year.
7	164	I have severe cramps and I have not bled since the 6 weeks after I got my 2nd shot so I was happy about not having a period.
7	165	I have had horrible mood swings, & horrible cramps.
7	166	So tired muscle cramps and out of breath.
7	167	After about two and a half months, I began to start bleeding and having severe cramps, so much so I could not stand up straight.
7	168	At the height of my cramps, I discovered my body had shed my entire uterine lining at one time and it was the most frightening and gross thing I had seen.
7	169	No periods and no cramps after year 1!
7	170	Since then I only had minor spotting and cramps, no mood swings or major weight gain if anything my weight is far more stable and satisfactory.
7	171	Within two weeks of getting the injection I got really bad headache, depressed, abdominal cramps, flash bleeding vomiting , unstable gate , memory loss, my face broke out, lost a bunch of weight, optic nerve damage, I went into svt and the list goes on.
7	172	I've just gotten the second shot today, and I must say I love it, haven't had my period had the tiniest bit of spotting I still get cramps when I'm due for my period but nothing else.
7	173	It was regular just less than a month until each one and I also had really bad cramps to the point where I couldn't move.
7	174	I've also been experiencing a lot of headaches, and cramps that can get so bad they'll sometimes wake me up from dead sleep.
7	175	Major cramps to where I couldn't go to school, bloated super bad.
7	176	I tried the pill but had incredibly tender breasts, tried the copper coil for 6 weeks but had cramps and spotting.
7	177	First week was fine but after a while I began spotting and since then I have been on a constant period with occasional cramps.
7	178	Also, I spot once a month extremely lightly, rarely get cramps.
7	179	I haven't had any of the side effects like having unusual cramps, headaches, or ance.
7	180	I have severe breast ache on my left breast and sometimes I may get cramps.
7	181	My sex drive is gone, side pains, cramps, headaches, and so tired all the time.
7	182	It has helped so much since, I used to get severe painful cramps and lay in bed for the week when I had my periods.
7	183	It makes me have a lot less things to worry about like chance of pregnancy, periods, cramps, and a lot more things my body was emotionally drained from.
7	184	I swear by it one of the greatest thing you don't forget to take it daily no cramps no period nothing up your private area.
7	185	I'm in my 2nd month and I've been having really bad cramps, constant bleeding, and diarrhea.
7	186	For the first 6 months, I had lighter and shorter periods without the awful cramps.
7	187	I only went on birth control because I was scared of getting pregnant in college, but I would truly recommend this to anyone who is fed up dealing with period cramps and other inconveniences.
7	188	Then I got very intense cramps that would wake me up in the night and make me feel sick.
7	189	Before I had a very light and short period and light cramps.
7	190	Sometimes light, sometimes like an actual period, with cramps and migraines.
7	191	I also will get a lot of sharp pain cramps that will last a few minutes every now and then but this happens randomly.
7	192	The doctor tells me the spotting and cramps will stop as my body gets used to the shot.
7	193	I haven't had ANY bleeding, no cramps, no headaches or dizziness, no mood swings, no swollen or tender breasts, no weight gain, nothing!
7	194	Also if you have bad cramps and/or heavy miserable periods.
7	195	Or in some cases having horrible cramps & heavy periods.
7	196	I used to have awful cramps and heavy bleeding, but now I literally have no period whatsoever.
7	197	I spot for about a month but I don't always need a tampon and I have minimal to no cramps.
7	198	I used it for 6 months (2 shots) and never had a period or spotting or cramps or anything.
7	199	Not bleeding, no cramps, and I still had my very active sex life.
7	200	I still had periods, but had absolutely no cramps at all, which is saying a lot since I had horrible pains before, and the bleeding was light.
7	201	No period, no cramps, no babies, love it.
7	202	I love that I have never had a period let alone spotting, no cramps, nothing.
7	203	You get cramps everyday as if you just got your period.
7	204	I loved it the whole time but during this last year, my hair started falling out, I started to get bad cramps each month with no bleeding and my breasts became very tender and painful also.
7	205	The first month was great but ever since then I will go almost a month bleeding off a week or so then another month and I have the worst cramps ever.
7	206	I haven't had any cramps but I do spot for a couple weeks before my shot is due.
7	207	I haven't had a real period since the day I started, no cramps or any symptoms of that at all.
7	208	It worked great as birth control though and I didn't ever get pregnant but there was no prediction or pattern to my irregular bleeding and the pain of the cramps was something I've never experienced since.
7	209	Tummy upset, cramping, fatigue and loads of money spent on liners, tampons and pads.
7	210	ZERO sex drive, extreme fatigue, lots of weight gain, major anxiety (needed medication), moodiness.. now that I stopped, I'm having major abdominal cramping, similar to mild contractions.
7	211	I have always been very regular hormonally, my periods have always been around 3 days & fairly light with minor cramping.
7	212	At first it was great, as someone who had bad cramping and heavy periods, it was amazing to not feel pain nor experience heavy bleeding.
7	213	About 7 or 8 months ago I started having really bad abdominal cramping again, weight gain, break through periods, etc.
7	214	This was very easy one shot good for 3 months but I experienced the worst side effects, weight gain, cramping, and spotting for almost 2 months straight.
7	215	Not getting cramping yet.
7	216	The first month was really rough, I had a continuous period for the whole month, I had major mood swings, major cramping.
7	217	After that I never really had any cramping or anything like that.
7	218	The only other side effects that I have had besides the initial irregular bleeding is mild cramping off and on and I can see a difference in my temper.
7	219	Ever since I've started getting the injections my side affects has been SEVERE mood swings, DECREASE in my libido, cramping and nausea.
7	220	The cramping during the first month was ridiculous, unlike any other cramping I experienced.
7	221	Over the last three days I've had nothing but severe cramping, that I can't function with.
7	222	I was on Sprintec from the age of 16 because of horrible cramping.
7	223	I started the beginning of my junior year in high school because my periods were so bad that I would miss school because of cramping.
7	224	I do get lower cramping once in awhile but it is tolerable .
7	225	I've suffered major headaches, weight gain, mood swings, hot flashes, irregular bleeding, cramping, breast pain, and change in sex drive.
7	226	After the first 3 weeks on the shot I had heavy period for almost 20 days, but after that absolutely no period, no cramping, spotting, nothing!
7	227	Been on it for about 2 1/2 years, only side effects are some weight gain (5-10 pounds) and minor cramping once a month maybe.
7	228	I have gained weight that is IMPOSSIBLE to lose, I get head rushes and I feel dizzy almost every time I stand up and lots of cramping.
7	229	One weekend I suffered severe and I must emphasize severe pain and cramping I could not move and was having very dark blood clots.
7	230	I was having horrible cramping and pain with my periods to the point that I would have to call off from work!
7	231	I'm off it now, but I loved it: I didn't gain weight, no cramping, no nausea, no migraines.
7	232	But since then I have had almost no sex drive, constant breakouts, and for the past 3 weeks or so I've had my period with severe cramping.
7	233	It's huge cramping, and sometimes bloating.
7	234	The only problem I've had is just recently, for my last shot I went to a different doctor and they gave me the generic version which caused me to bleed very heavily and severe cramping so I know to never use the generic form again.
7	235	I feel a little more tired than usually and I'm a little crampy but that's to be expected.
7	236	Overall I had no side effects aside for spotting and the intense spotting didn’t happen until the third shot (by intense I mean random bleeding for less than a day, lots of stained underwear and constant pantyliners).
7	237	After this 4th shot my next move is to switch to nexplanon and hope that a slower chemical release will help my spotting.
7	238	Non stop spotting for a month.
7	239	As far as spotting I’ve had some super light spotting for about 2 weeks when I first got the injection and haven’t since then.
7	240	I had a little spotting towards the end, and it stopped after I got the second shot.
7	241	I didn't spot the first time I got the shot but a month or two after I started spotting and it's been constant for about 6 months now.
7	242	I was spotting for about 2 weeks.
7	243	Its September 13 and I'm still spotting.
7	244	The first month I spotted and when it was about the time I get my period it got a little heavier for two days and back to spotting for 2 more weeks.
7	245	I rather deal with irregular spotting than a child so I will continue use.
7	246	Then I started spotting for a week and now its getting heavy.
7	247	I have the worst mood swings ever and I've been spotting for a month.
7	248	My first 2 years on the depo went quite smoothly but I have noticed that it made me very depressed and messed up my sex drive, but the last few months I've been noticing that I've been very moody, depressed, spotting, nauseous every other day, weight loss & I've also been feeling very dizzy and weak.
7	249	I have lost so much weight I am always angry sad even depressed my hair is falling out and I've been spotting non stop and my sex drive is gone.
7	250	smh I feel so bad because I don't want to have sex when I am always spotting.
7	251	First 3 months I was always spotting & I was always angry.
7	252	The first time I got the shot I only experience spotting for about 2.5 months.
7	253	Yes you will bleed the first three months but mine was regular like my period from what I remember with a lil spotting in between.
7	254	Now, March 2017, I have had no spotting.
7	255	I had some spotting at first but then no periods ever, no issues at all and I even lost weight.
7	256	I just had a baby in Nov. 2016 and got the shot in Dec. 2016 by Jan 16 I started spotting and I have my period now for two weeks non-stop.
7	257	I have spotting which my doctor told me that was normal.
7	258	I've never became pregnant while using depo & I only have spotting during the two weeks my depo is due so about once every 3 mo.
7	259	After the first month I did not get my period anymore OR spotting.
7	260	The first few times I got the shot I had some inconsistent spotting.
7	261	I had the spotting in the beginning for about 3 months and after the second shot I felt dizzy all the time.
7	262	Since skipping my last shot I've had heaving spotting and headaches almost every day.
7	263	I started this birth control back when I was 18 the first few months it wasn't too bad, there wasn't any spotting, and I didn't have any periods.
7	264	Especially, since the spotting is supposed to happen towards the beginning and stop later on.
7	265	At first it was awesome I feel better no heavy menstrual period, crampings and headache..But after 3 weeks from the shot  I  started to experience spottings, and it never stop...It is really uncomfortable wearing the whole time  bunch of panty liners..And of course when in sexual intercourse it was very messy and we need to used newspaper to cover our bed before sex..Having sex with spotting is not good...So I will not get another shot had to stop this..Never do it again it's scary when you had blood or spotting continuesly.My boyfriend told to get  checked and must see a doctor right away..
7	266	I was spotting for a full month!!
7	267	The spotting would be every other month and I would still get my period.
7	268	I started spotting every single day.
7	269	It has now been over 100 days & the spotting has not stopped.
7	270	That was the first week of June 2016 and I haven't stopped spotting since.
7	271	It WAS NOT just "spotting", it was a full on period.
7	272	I rarely ever stopped spotting.
7	273	I have had no spotting either.
7	274	I felt like I was crazy and pregnant, had constant spotting it was horriable.
7	275	It's my first shot, so I did have some spotting, but that was it.
7	276	I had to switch my birth control to a different one because the Depo shot made me gain so much weight and I had continuous on and off spotting for a week and i kept getting this pain in both my legs and could get ride of the pain so I would not recommend this birth control to anyone
7	277	The first three year I had spotting every now and then and would some times bleed for 12 days straight.. And then I was only getting a period once a year....I just recently stopped the depo shot after getting a lap procedure done ...
7	278	I started spotting and kept spotting for a month, however I was told spotting could happen but with time and continued shots it could stop entirely.
7	279	I experience slight spotting and hot flashes most of the time.
7	280	Now that the second month hit I started feeling moody, and randomly started spotting.
7	281	I have been spotting for a month and no sign of it going away.
7	282	The first shot was fine, no abnormal physical side effects, maybe a little spotting during what should have been my menstrual cycle.
7	283	The second month wasnt too bad, although I had quite a bit of spotting and this month has been better.
7	284	To all the negitive reviews it really depends on the person I had my youngest december 26 2015 and in mid January I got the depo shot and I've lost weight I hadn't had a peroid I only had two days of spotting my sex drive is starting to come back and as far as moody goes I've been Moody my whole life here my skin is clear that's about all I can say so please don't listen to the negatives I know there's a lot built depends on the person
7	285	After my 1st shot I had some spotting for a few days.
7	286	Yes it was not as heavy, but it did cause spotting for a majority of the 3 months I was on it.
7	287	I didn't have a period, zero spotting never gained any weight from it and I liked not having to worry about taking a pill.
7	288	After the third shot I haven't had a period or spotting since.
7	289	Stayed on it for a year (4 shots) with no periods or period side effects, just some spotting.
7	290	No symptoms but spotting.
7	291	The only time I have a problem is if I forget to go in at the end of the 3 months because then my body usually gets off track and I start to have spotting.
7	292	I have had no spotting throughout the 6 months.
7	293	I haven't had any periods just spotting now and then.
7	294	I've had random spotting and bleeding throughout the past 3 weeks and I don't know how much more of it I can take.
7	295	While the irregular periods, frequent spotting, and slightly heavier periods are a drag, the shot has worked very well for me.
7	296	You have no sex lids because your constantly spotting and bleeding.
7	297	However I did get spotting in between, which was expected.
7	298	I have never had a period or spotting in this time.
7	299	I started spotting in August - a sign that my body is going back to normal ish.
7	300	For me, I got my period a week after the shot and I went for about a week, the second month was spotting for almost 3 weeks, the third month was spotting for 2.
7	301	I went in for my second injection after being warned that the spotting is a normal occurrence as long as it is not followed by pain and that the DEPO doesn't work overnight.
7	302	I was on my last day of my period and since then I have only had mild spotting.
7	303	I got it while I was on my period and then 3 days later I stopped bleeding then about 2 weeks after I started spotting which lasted a week, now it's been almost 3 and a half weeks and I'm still bleeding I'm constantly tired because of the lack of iron from bleeding for so long.
7	304	My mood swings are ridiculous, my anger is out of control, I'm constantly bloated, I've become very constipated, spotting comes out of no where, and I'm constantly exhausted.
7	305	I  always spotting and have ruined countless underwear.
7	306	I knew there would be some spotting but the spotting has not stopped.
7	307	I haven't had a period since but very light spotting from time to time.
7	308	I recently stopped because I got sick of the spotting.
7	309	I have had no period or spotting until about two years on it.
7	310	I got this shot bc of a pregnancy scare and it's only been a week but I've had non stop brown spotting.
7	311	Not spotting, a full on period.
7	312	I did have pretty irregular spotting and bleeding for the first three months, but now I can't remember the last time I saw any blood, which suits me just fine!
7	313	I went from giving birth to the needle straight away and never had a period, spotting or anything.
7	314	No bleeding no spotting what so ever !!!
7	315	Overall I think it's fine considering I don't have to remember it and the spotting I heard gets better over time.
7	316	Constant spotting and bleeding, never was able to go on the boat because I didn't have enough bleeding for a tampon but would bleed threw a bathing suit, felt very uncomfortable and always had to think about if I was bleeding, never wore white bottoms or pants.
7	317	Occasionally I will get brown discharge or very light spotting, but it is such a small amount that I don't even notice.
7	318	After the first shot, I had a light period for about 3 weeks but no period or spotting ever after that.
7	319	ONLY thing that sucked was in the beginning I had abnormal bleeding and spotting that stopped after the second shot and I haven't had a period since.
7	320	I was terrified or weight gain, spotting, and mood swings, all of which this shot is rumored to do.
7	321	And I tend to start spotting around the time that my next shot is due.
7	322	Once I receive the depo shot, within hours the spotting stops.
7	323	There was minimal spotting which I would take over periods any day.
7	324	I had very light spotting after the first shot during what should have been my monthly period, and since then have had absolutely no period or spotting.
7	325	I used to have TERRIBLE periods, ever since my first shot I haven't had a single period or spotting.
7	326	I have been on the shot for 9 years, I love it, my doctor said I will have to take Xanax and Lexapro with the Depo to even out the mood swings, I am fine and my moods are good, it is natural that your body has bleeding and spotting I have it too, but it does not bother me as much as I suffered with PMS, forgetting things all the time, and being bitchy.
7	327	I now am back to skipping the first period after getting the shot and sometimes skip the second or sometimes light spotting.
7	328	My first shot of depo was great, no mood swings or any other side affects other than some very light spotting.
7	329	However, I was told my period would completely go away or just be light spotting, but for some reason I have now been having a normal/heavy period for over a month now which concerning.
7	330	I started off with no side effects for the first 3 weeks, until I was late for my period by 2 weeks, then when I eventually had my period I have been spotting for the last 6 weeks.
7	331	I feel as though I will keep using Depo for the next 2 shots and see if anything changes, because overall I feel as though minus the spotting it is beneficial.
7	332	And since then I've had not even the slightest spotting.
7	333	Not only that, but I basically lost all my sex drive, and the majority of the time on the shot I spotted, and when I wasn't spotting, I was on my period.
7	334	I can't imagine going back to having a monthly period, I am very content with my light spotting every three months a week before my next shot.
7	335	I have just recently got my second shot a few weeks ago, and since I received my first shot I haven't had any periods or abnormal bleeding or spotting.
7	336	No periods or spotting.
7	337	I haven't gotten my period once and I've gotten spotting once and it last around 2 seconds.
7	338	Started spotting a pink color.
7	339	I have not gotten my period since starting the Depo but only some light spotting a few days before I was due for my next injection.
7	340	I don't get my period.. just usually spotting about two weeks before I'm due for another shot.
7	341	No period just very light spotting month before next shot due.
7	342	I did have spotting for about 3 weeks in the beginning.
7	343	1st year was rocky with the spotting and mood swings.
7	344	I had some spotting but my period completely stopped after the 2nd shot.
7	345	Besides some spotting when I'm up for my next shot.
7	346	I stopped getting periods altogether after the second shot and have had very light spotting only a few times (lasting less than a day).
7	347	Eventually it went into light spotting about every 4 weeks for a few days.
7	348	I have been on Depo for 3.5 years now and the first entire year I had spotting almost everyday.
7	349	No periods besides occasional spotting, no pregnancy, no weight gain (I've actually lost a few pounds).
7	350	Occasional spotting, but that's really rare and only lasts for a day.
7	351	I would get occasional spotting like once a year.
7	352	I literally had spotting from March to June.
7	353	Not a regular period just brown spotting.
7	354	I had no sex drive, pain during intercourse, 10 pounds of weight gain for the first two months and 5 for the third month, and spotting daily.
7	355	I've had light spotting a few times before but nothing too heavy and it never lasted long until now.
7	356	Now in the second month I had two weeks of spotting and now another week of a full period continues.
7	357	Only had spotting if I was getting close to being late for shot.
7	358	I've been spotting every day ever since I got it.
7	359	I've always had irregular periods and when I did have them I was in immense pain, but since I've been on the Depo shot I haven't had any spotting or a period and it's wonderful.
7	360	Now I've reached a point where I might have light spotting once during a shot cycle.
7	361	I had slight spotting, then periods were gone after 2nd shot, no headaches, small weight gain, and still less interested in sex than I would like to be but no birth control is perfect.
7	362	I am 28 and have been on it for two years now and I finally stopped bleeding and spotting.
7	363	I've been spotting for a year now (and still is) I've gained at least 30lbs, I have no sex drive, and I have lost about 3 inches of my hair.
7	364	I very rarely get my period, and if I do, it's like about every 2 months, and its only spotting.
7	365	I didn't get spotting or anything maybe I was a lucky few but there was some side effects that my body and mind did not like.
7	366	When I first started getting the shot I had some spotting and no periods.
7	367	This has slowly increased and for the past two months I have had spotting everyday.
7	368	I had about a month of spotting when I got my 1st injection, but I have since stopped having periods altogether.
7	369	After a few months on the shot, I stopped getting periods completely, not even any spotting.
7	370	I was on the Depo for about 2 1/2 years, and after some initial spotting (about 9 months) I loved it.
7	371	I didn't notice any side effects, my period was replaced by light spotting about 3 weeks before I was due for my next shot.
7	372	Thats 2 days after my period i thought everything was going to be fine I didn't bleed or even spot for the first 2 months!
7	373	I rather get my period once a month then spot for an entire month.
7	374	I have been on depo for 2 years and haven't had a period since going on this just the odd spot here and there before my next injection is due... but thats about the only good point for me.
7	375	After about a year in some months, I would only spot 1 wk before getting the shot and 1 wk after.
7	376	Now I don't get periods ever and ever so often i might spot for a day or two.
7	377	I started to spot around the time for my next shot,  for a few years but as of now I never bleed.
7	378	I'd have my period and then spot like ever other few days.
7	379	I also don't get periods which I LOVE but when it's about time for a new shot I do spot a little.
7	380	), didn't spot, it didn't break me out, didn't mess with my mood, BUT I gained a lot of weight (which did plateau).
7	381	I'm starting to spot due to my period always comes on the 20th.
7	382	I would spot for a couple days after and it would go away.
7	383	The only time I spot is when I'm getting close to my due date for my next shot.
7	384	Only thing bothering me is the injection spot is sore.
7	385	First year of being on depo was ok would still always spot and would always get a period before my 3months was up.
7	386	Before I was very happy, me and my boyfriend were at a good spot and I had a good relationship with everyone around me.
7	387	My period didn't last that long like other ladies, but I did spot almost everyday.
7	388	My skin couldn't be clearer, I only spot as an indication I need the next shot, I haven't had my period since I've started this birth control, & absolutely no weight gain!
7	389	About a week before I am due for my three month shot I will spot but it is no big deal.
7	390	Although I love that I never have to think about taking my birth control, the depo shot makes me spot, a lot.
7	391	I would rather take the pill and have a regular period than have to spot every day.
7	392	My experience on depo has been great so far , I been on it for one year I don't bleed for days , however I spot time to time.
7	393	I only spot about 4 weeks before my next shot and have had a little bleeding lately.
7	394	I don't have periods although for the first month and a half I did spot on and off.
7	395	I spot one month after getting the shot up until I get the next shot, then it repeats.
7	396	I did bleed and spot for about 3 weeks after which I think is totally normal because that has happened to me in starting any new birth control (pill & patch).
7	397	In the first 4 months, I did have some bleeding issues (I would spot for weeks at a time), but I haven't had a period in a long time.
7	398	The only problem that I have is I spot on and off for about 2-3 weeks right before I'm supposed to get my next shot.
7	399	I also spot monthly and for the first two months i bled heavily.
7	400	I began to spot within the month I was off of it and only skipped the January cycle; by June my cycle ranged from 25 to 30 days, and by now to an avg of 25, which is normal.
7	401	I don't spot to often only when its about time to get my shot again, which I think is pretty normal.
7	402	Now I normally will lightly spot or clot before my next shot is due.
7	403	The most annoying one is the irregular bleeding, for example: I've had 1 regular period since the start, then it stopped the next month, then I bled (spotted) the whole next month, now I am just spotty throughout the month on and off.
7	404	My first year on the shot everything went smooth beside the fact I spotted after sex.
7	405	I spotted and bled more when I got the shot after I had the baby but it wasnt to bad.
7	406	I have spotted a few times, but that happens maybe twice a year and even then it's only for a day at the most.
7	407	I never spotted and after I got my shot my period were officially gone.
7	408	I actually spotted for 3 months straight when I started it!!
7	409	I spotted for about 20 days and I was gucci.
7	410	I spotted a little the next month but haven't bled at all since!
7	411	I had no issues what so ever being on it I never spotted, I never gained weight.
7	412	The first year was great spotted 3 months in and then never had a period at all.
7	413	I spotted for about 5 days twice within the first 3 months which isn't bad.
7	414	First month I spotted nonstop, but I haven't had a single period since.
7	415	I have not had a single period and only spotted one time.
7	416	I spotted for months at a time which didn't seem like a good trade off for no period.
7	417	So this time around right after the first shot I bled (spotted) literally for 3 months straight.
7	418	During the first month I spotted the whole time.
7	419	I think I may have spotted a couple of times but only for a couple of days (so far).
7	420	I don't get any other PMS symptoms and I have NEVER spotted.
7	421	I had horrible mood swings and I spotted the entire 3 months until the shot left my system.
7	422	Only spotted for the first 2 or 3 months then every once in awhile after that.
7	423	I spotted for almost a year and then my period went away all together.
7	424	My only complaint is after every injection, I would get a headache for a couple of days.
7	425	I would get moody bad headache no appetite.. My last shot
7	426	Horrible mood swings nausea headache
7	427	I am 28 yrs old, I have been on the Depo shot for 3 months now to regulate my periods, my first 2 months I didn't get my period at all, no side affects except a headache for the first week.
7	428	I also began having slight headaches maybe once a month, which caused me to finally switch birth controls after 2 years.
7	429	I have been on the depo for 5 years now , the only side effects I have experienced were increased appetite and headaches.
7	430	I have really bad abdominal pain, and not to mention the worse headaches and dizziness of my life.
7	431	During my second shot I've experience severe abdominal pain causing me to barely be able to eat for a few months now, depression that comes and goes out of nowhere, headaches, weakness and fatigue even if I sleep 8 hours I still feel exhausted throughout the day, and since the second shot I've had multiple anxiety attacks.
7	432	In the beginning I had bad headaches, vomiting & non stop periods.
7	433	I have body tremors,hair loss,headaches,nausea, dizzy,tiredness,weakness and that's just some..
7	434	Even scarier, since I started this medicine, I started getting crazy headaches.
7	435	I got a second shot in August and the bleeding stopped but I started getting headaches and feeling dizzy frequently.
7	436	My first couple weeks I had nausea and headaches.
7	437	It  began with tingling and numbness in my hands and feet and crazy intense headaches.
7	438	In 2 months, I haven't gained any weight (controlling my diet), but I have insane dreams that keep me up every single night, fatigue, increased abdominal pain, periods that have lasted all month, mood swings, migraine headaches (haven't had those in 8 years), and a loss in sex drive.
7	439	Weight gain ,hair loss, mood swings joint and muscle pain,  constant headaches and dizzy, no sex drive at all and more..
7	440	Ever since I've got it, I've had horrible headaches every single day, the only thing that helps is Exedrin Migraine.
7	441	I have crazy and horrible mood swings, i feel depressed most of the time (I've never suffered from depression) i feel tired and sick all the time,constant headaches and weight loss.
7	442	I'm not going to get depo again because the night sweats n leg pain n some minor headaches I don't like.
7	443	It causes AWFUL headaches.
7	444	I always have bad headaches and belly ache.
7	445	I've had severe headaches and backaches.
7	446	Ever since I took this shot I have been having extreme shooting pains up my arm and terrible headaches.
7	447	I get headaches every day since getting the shot.
7	448	I get the worst headaches that I've ever had before and they last all day and I get them everyday.
7	449	I have constant headaches and backaches.
7	450	The headaches dizziness and tiredness.
7	451	I have headaches every single day.
7	452	The only problems I've had is severe mood swings, nausea, and headaches daily.
7	453	I was always hungry, severe backaches & headaches, and few hot flashes.
7	454	I've been on the Depo shot for a year now and the only problems I'd faced were the headaches, nausea, and mood swings.
7	455	I also have extremely bad headaches.
7	456	I'm switching to the Nuvaring because my weight gain is unbearable and my headaches are chronic.
7	457	Also, I've been having excruciating headaches.
7	458	It's terrible, hopefully the cravings, appetite, headaches, and also these mood swings I've been having get better.
7	459	Depo is great for no periods but if you feel sick or get headaches a lot with it then it's not for you.
7	460	I also had pregnancy like symptoms, headaches and bloating.
7	461	Just recently I have been having terrible headaches that make me nauseous.
7	462	I also got headaches a lot - not really bad ones but annoying enough.
7	463	When I went back to get my prescription refilled, I told the doctor about the headaches and that one of my eyes was becoming slightly nearsighted.
7	464	I have headaches, my stomach is hurting painfully most of my time.
7	465	I am now experiencing terrible migraines (I rarely, if ever had even minor headaches).
7	466	I first got the shot In 2013 but I didn't like it I was bleeding for 3 months as well so I never got it again until this June after Inga my daughter I'm on my second shot I've only bled for one day so far and only had a migraine for about 2 days so this time around my experience is better than my first
7	467	And, around the 12 weeks mark migraines
7	468	I took the second shot thinking my body would start getting used to it and balancing everything out and the same thing happened again but I started to get more stomach pains and migraines.
7	469	It has really messed me up in don't know if anyone has the same issues I get severe migraines monthly and a rash that itches like no other where the injected the shot in my butt every month right before my period starts.
7	470	My doctor and I thought it might help balance out my hormones and help my migraines.
7	471	I had migraines for days on end with no relief not even form sleep.
7	472	I've been on depo provera since October I had to switch to this as I was getting migraines from the pill I was on, I've just gotten my 3rd injection 2 days ago.
7	473	This is one of the only hormonal methods of bc that doesn't kill my sex drive or cause migraines.
7	474	Weight gain, mood swings, stomach pain, none existent libido, migraines -all this can be yours with a shot of depo
7	475	My doctor recommended Depo-Provera for me because I suffer from chronic migraines so any birth control with a high level of estrogen would most definitely make my migraines worse.
7	476	My doctor warned me that the shot could make my migraines worse, but I haven't noticed any difference in prevalence or severity.
7	477	I liked this medication when I first got it but after awhile I started to get migraines, dizziness, hot flashes, weight gain, heavy bleeding and severe depression.
7	478	However, I have terrible mood swings, migraines, and weight gain.
7	479	On the shot i have experienced horrific migraines, nausea, extreme mood swing, severe depression and high levels of anxiety.
7	480	I'm 26 years old and have osteoporosis that of an 80 year old, the smaller of my breast became 2 sizes larger, my migraines increased to weekly with vision loss, itchy sore breasts, random stomach pains and nausea.
7	481	Unfortunetly about once a week I get excruciating migraines to the point where I can't see.
7	482	I am a healthy 28 year old, aside from suffering from migraines.
7	483	I am not able to use oral contraceptives containing estrogen, as I have migraines with auras (which puts me at a highly increased risk of stroke).
7	484	I already have migraines.
7	485	I've had none of the side effects that people have mentioned such as depression, migraines or loss of libido actually I think it increased mine haha but the only thing that I've noticed was the weight gain and it was only maybe 5lbs a year so it wasn't that noticeable.
7	486	Mood swings and migraines daily.
7	487	I also had terrible mood swings and migraines.
7	488	Then no periods now I'm having migraines, nausea, and breast tenderness.
7	489	Noticed really bad migraines about 2 years into it.
7	490	Decreased my sex drive and physically in a lot more pain in my joints...
7	491	It completely took  away my sex drive, so the shot is pointless anyway when I’m not sexually active.
7	492	Missed my next dose on purpose because the Depo completely killed my sex drive.
7	493	Cons my sex drive was like a  on and off switch, weight gain, also no energy so its been a year that I've been on it I plan on getting in the gym you have to stay active with it I want to get off it but don't want to get pregnant and don't want to try anything else.
7	494	I also slowly lost my sex drive and it  became nonexistent.
7	495	So overall I loved being on the shot, I am very petite so I enjoyed the little weight gain, BUT it did decrease my sex drive.
7	496	Sex drive decreases.
7	497	My last shot expired in March and l am now trying for a baby in the last month l started feeling nauseous, vomiting, tiredness, tender breasts and increase in my sex drive.
7	498	My sex drive also completely went away.
7	499	I'm currently waiting to be seen by a gynacologist due to suffering constant pain during sex and no sex drive at all!
7	500	I've had absolutely no period the whole time, I've gained probably around 10 pounds, I have little to no sex drive, very moody every now and then and I get a little dizzy sometimes without reason?
7	501	I didn't gain any weight, didn't become depressed, or have mood swings, it didn't lower my sex drive, or cause me any discomfort with my periods, etc.
7	502	The only complaint I have was one that didn't show up until last couple of years (for which I ultimately stopped taking it): zero sex drive.
7	503	The only thing that sucks is I'm pretty sure my sex drive has been affected by the shot but it's not a big deal.
7	504	I stopped taking depo because of the depression and lack of sex drive it was causing me.
7	505	A break down of my body: Oily skin, gains weight easily, depression, and high sex drive.
7	506	Lower sex drive?
7	507	I also lost my sex drive.
7	508	Then I had a migraine/aura that sent me to ER so Depo was chosen so I have no sex drive and my discharge is thick clumpy during intercourse.
7	509	I have no sex drive extremely moody and have had weight gain and eat right and work out daily.
7	510	Also I've had no sex drive, mood swings, terrible anxiety, and depression.
7	511	The next shot instantly stopped my bleeding, at this point I am up 20 pounds and have no sex drive at all.
7	512	Shot 4 still no period or bleeding, no sex drive still.
7	513	And p.s it heightened my sex drive.
7	514	Always in a down mood and it killed my sex drive This drug is definitely not for me... Been off for 4 months now and still no sign of a period.... Hopefully it changes soon
7	515	I have had an increased sex drive which is a good benefit and if anything my boobs have gotten a small bit bigger and I've maintained my weight!
7	516	Its been decreasing my sex drive lately and  also occasionally makes me moody
7	517	I lost about 7 pounds and it increased my sex drive.
7	518	I have no sex drive, I have panic attacks daily, my hair started falling out, I literally sit in my room depressed when I'm not working, my vision changed, I have upper back pain and neck pain, I am tired all the time..
7	519	I have no sex drive what so ever.
7	520	Huge cons for me included zero sex drive and out of control mood swings along with suicidal thoughts because of my post-partum depression which I think the shots unnecessarily prolonged for years.
7	521	I've been so deppressed, and have had no sex drive.
7	522	I'm a young 33 year old and my sex drive has gone completely down hill!
7	523	I have a sex drive but no matter how wet I get, when he puts it in its like a burning sensation and it burns afterwards too.
7	524	I had depression, anxiety, weight gain, weeks of bleeding, appetite problems, fatigue, no sex drive.
7	525	My sex drive is very healthy, my mood swings aren't wild, I do not have a period/spotting or anything.
7	526	My sex drive is dead.
7	527	I also still had a normal sex drive.
7	528	I did not get pregnant on the shot because mainly my sex drive is nonexistant and I am so tired all the time.
7	529	Loss of sex drive which my longtime boyfriend is more than happy to help with.
7	530	Now into my 3rd month and I have had my period for going on 3 weeks straight and its really stressing me out, I have been irritable these past week, major mood swings and lost my sex drive.
7	531	I'm not pregnant but that may be because my sex drive is completely nonexistent.
7	532	The only side effects that I think I'm having now is low sex drive because I can't get into sex like I used too.
7	533	Though the shot is convenient, with no periods and strong hair and nails, I totally feel like I've been through menopause and am an old lady with NO sex drive.
7	534	I haven't lost my sex drive, but I have had major mood swings and sore breasts for the past 2 months.
7	535	Although I have no sex drive and terrible mood swings and weight gain in abdomen, face and buttocks.
7	536	No change in sex drive but I've noticed most people's decrease.
7	537	I didn't really have any interest in sex until I was 19, referring to sex drive.
7	538	However, I do wonder if it's had a negative effect on my sex drive, but that's inconsistent and I have nothing to compare it to since I got my shot as soon as I became sexually active, so it's hard to say.
7	539	I also have no sex drive.
7	540	They give it to them to drastically decrease their sex drive.
7	541	I also have no sex drive whatsoever.
7	542	I've been bleeding straight for two months now, awful mood swings and depression, extensive hair loss and no sex drive at all.
7	543	My only issue is that my sex drive has decreased slightly, but not severely enough that it has significantly affected my relationship with my boyfriend.
7	544	I still have a sex drive and I feel perfectly normal, most people with good side effects don't think to share their experience, so remember that everyone's body is different and your experience might be like mine!
7	545	However, I have absolutely NO sex drive.
7	546	I am a little more moody and my sex drive has decreased, but I am most concerned about the long term bone density loss.
7	547	My sex drive is just as high as usual.
7	548	I have had the worst side effects, I've gained over 25 lbs, ALWAYS tired, no sex drive and extremely moody all the time.
7	549	I was constantly depressed, no sex drive, and the scale kept climbing even after efforts to eat healthier and exercise.
7	550	Also, I was very very moody (irritable) and my sex drive tanked.
7	551	I have not bled once since, my moods have stabilized and my sex drive is back!
7	552	Sex drive hasn't decreased!
7	553	Well it backfired, I gained 30 pounds after starting the shot, became extremely depressed, mood swings, and my sex drive completely gone.
7	554	Very dry have to use lubricant every time and almost no sex drive at all.
7	555	It also decreased my sex drive.
7	556	I have gained at least 15 lbs, which is very depressing, and sex drive...well that's long gone(which seems very odd for a 20 year old).
7	557	I never experience a lowered sex drive and I live life normally with the exception of no period.
7	558	Within the first month, I had literally NO sex drive.
7	559	Definitely no lowered sex drive.
7	560	My sex drive hasn't decreased a bit.
7	561	When on the shot, I experience excessive hair loss and a low sex drive.
7	562	And for the past month or month and a half my sex drive has been virtually nonexistent.
7	563	I love how I don't get my period, but my sex drive has decreased and I have gained about 70 lbs.
7	564	It has NOT affected my sex drive.
7	565	Well i've been on depo for almost 8 years now, and the only benefit is I have no "that time of the month" but i've had major weight gain, no sex drive, and I break out more then I have when I was in high school!
7	566	I also experienced neck stiffness, severe mood swings, bouts of depression that seemed to arrive from nowhere, no sex drive what so ever, and worst of all menstrual bleeding for an entire month straight which was only counteracted by a high dosage of birth control pills.
7	567	my only concern are the mood swings and low libido.
7	568	My libido was also gone and it took over a year after the 2nd and final injection to feel better in terms of the depression.
7	569	My libido never recovered.
7	570	It also completely ruined my libido.
7	571	My libido has completely crashed and I almost always need to use lube.
7	572	It did not mess with my libido, which is a good thing.
7	573	I have found my libido seriously lowered.
7	574	Pills sent me into a temporary depression and lowered my libido.
7	575	On both previous methods I definitely gained weight (at least 5-10 pounds) and was moody with total lack of libido.
7	576	I thought I could put up with it, before I realized that my libido had been slowly decreasing as well.
7	577	I had a decreased libido.
7	578	Another minor symptom I had was serious weight gain, luckily that went away almost immediately upon coming off of the shot.
7	579	I believe weight gain is a common symptom of the shot though, granted I was only on it for three months- so, I only had one shot.
7	580	The only side effect was the massive weight gain.
7	581	It took me about a year to naturally lose all the weight gain.
7	582	I did experience weight gain at first, I was 128 lbs starting on it then ballooned to 165 in the first 3 years, and now hover at 153 lbs (without real exercise but watching what I eat), I'm 5'6".
7	583	Although, after about 6 months (2 shots) I noticed a significant amount of weight gain, and after almost a year I gained about 20-25 pounds.
7	584	The weight gain was my major concern.
7	585	After reading all of the other reviews for depo, I saw a lot of other women had issues with weight gain too, so I switched to nexplanon  (implant), and for me it has had the same side effects as the shot BUT without weight gain.
7	586	I was on depot for 4 months after giving birth, I stopped having the shots as it caused moodiness, ange, depression, weight gain and all sorts of probs I'd never had before.
7	587	So weight gain is pretty normal so I'm sure it wasn't all depo related.
7	588	First month was normal no bleeding, normal sex, no weight gain, no problems at all.
7	589	If you don't mind weight gain, it's a great option.
7	590	But the weight gain is too much for me.
7	591	I don't mind the weight gain.
7	592	Otherwise, no significant weight gain.
7	593	I'm generally prone to weight gain but didn't experience this at all after starting the shot; I started training for a fitness competition shortly after and was concerned it might be harder for me to cut weight but had no issues whatsoever.
7	594	But honesty I loved the shot and only had weight gain.
7	595	Which I believe is down to the depo, like others have said I've noticed weight gain too whilst on this as well as joint pains.
7	596	I been on the shot for 7 months now have had no side effects except weight gain which is a plus for me since I was 113 lbs and now am 135 lbs since I have always had so much difficulty gaining weight also after the 4th month my period went away don't know when and if I'll get it back which is also a good thing for me.
7	597	The weight gain was the only problem I had with this shot.
7	598	The main reason I stopped taking it was because of the weight gain.
7	599	It actually gets the job done, prevents pregnancy and stopped my period, however, the weight gain is real, mood swings, and I don't need anymore of those anyway.
7	600	I've never had problems with weight gain but did notice it made me a little more emotional then I had been off it.
7	601	This birth control is very effective and easy to keep up with, but one of the side effects was weight gain.
7	602	Now after 12 months of this the only issue is weight gain.
7	603	I got off it because the weight gain was too much.
7	604	I heard that it could cause weight gain, mood swings, excessive eating, and it could even result in making your period worse.
7	605	No weight gain, no increased appetite for me but everyones bodies are different.
7	606	For me it was quick easy convenient, I had no side effects what so ever...except the WEIGHT GAIN.
7	607	It also over the period of 18 months I was using it caused me severe anxiety and weight gain.
7	608	I love it, I didn't experience weight gain although I did bleed consecutively for five months after being on it for four years (this last year has been fine).
7	609	Some slight weight gain, and mood swings.
7	610	I never experienced any weight gain or craziness from it.
7	611	I did experience weight gain, but I mean c'mon, if you're going to eat more, then you have to exercise more.
7	612	I do believe depo causes weight gain, although it could just be because I started taking it at 18 years old (about 120 lbs) and now I'm 23 (145 lbs).
7	613	Weight gain?
7	614	I has mood swings like no other but the biggest turn off for me was the weight gain.
7	615	I got on depo in April and a little bit later around may I noticed weight gain in my arms not so much my stomach in July I went to take my second shot and every since the second shot I always feel bloated I have gain extreme weight in my stomach and face .
7	616	The only side effect that I don't like is the weight gain.
7	617	I have been working out like crazy to prevent the weight gain, which I haven't gained any weight but I can't loose any.
7	618	I never experienced any weight gain or hormonal changes.
7	619	Weight gain, TERRIBLE ACNE (never had anything nearly this bad as a teenager) and absolutely constant bleeding/spotting.
7	620	0 complaints, i had no period,weight gain or emotional crap.
7	621	That's not including the side effects during: severe weight gain, mood swings
7	622	I went from being 120lbs to 165lbs from october to april it was crazy it worked very very well and was extremely easy to get and the injection mildly hurt but the weight gain is the reason i stopped getting it.
7	623	I was on Depo-Provera for 15 months and the only negative side effect I experienced was weight gain, which is why I recently stopped.
7	624	I had rapid weight gain and gained 30lbs in two years.
7	625	While on the depo I had no issues other than severe weight gain.
7	626	hair loss, weight gain, pain, emotional issues, as I had none of those symptoms but I may not have been on it long enough.
7	627	I noticed alot of stomach pain, tingling in hands or feet, feeling nauseated when eating food, hair lost and weight gain.
7	628	HOWEVER, since I've been on it for a yr. now & my side effects: fatigue, hot flashes, fatigue, mood swings/anxiety, & weight gain of 25 lbs.!
7	629	The main problem for me was the weight gain I used to be size 12 now I'm size 16-18!!!
7	630	I didn't have any bleeding whatsoever nor any weight gain.
7	631	I had my first shot when I was 18, I had heavy bleeding and weight gain for the whole 3 months.
7	632	no weight gain, loss of sleep, or excessive bleeding..
7	633	Caused HORRIBLE depression, terrible weight gain and basically got every side effect this drug can cause.
7	634	I was scared the most of the weight gain more then anything else, After reading reviews on different birth controls and peoples experiences with it I couldn't bare the fact of gaining so much weight.
7	635	I want to try the pills to avoid weight gain.
7	636	I was well aware of the weight gain and the irregular periods before going on it.
7	637	If you do not care about the weight gain, this birth control is definitely for you.
7	638	I never noticed a weight gain, no periods at all for this entire time.
7	639	I've been on it since November 2014 and havnt had my period since, no weight gain besides maybe 2 pounds (not bad at all seeing im only 100 lbs) and havnt had any other side effects.
7	640	And no weight gain.
7	641	Doctors will tell you that it is your diet that is causing the weight gain.
7	642	I've been on the depo shot since 2013 , I think it works well, but the bad part is weight gain.
7	643	I was on this medication for 15 years and in this time I did not experience any side effects maybe a little weight gain but nothing drastic.
7	644	I've had no pregenancy scares but severe bleeding for four months now and black blood, weight gain like crazy and breast pain everyday, it works well for birth control but the side effects are not worth it
7	645	No weight gain as of yet and no hair loss.
7	646	Very gradual weight gain for me, 25 lbs over the past five years.
7	647	My only complaint is that in the 2nd shot I got really bad boob pain and a bit of weight gain.
7	648	So overall I gave it a 4 rating because it is effective but the weight gain is horrible
7	649	I have had no weight gain or any other side effects.
7	650	I haven't had a period, no weight gain like people are scared of, and no bad side effects.
7	651	Definite weight gain.
7	652	No weight gain, no bleeding whatsoever, and no uncomfortable side effects.
7	653	No weight gain at all.
7	654	When I first got on this I actually lost weight & was the smallest I'd ever been, but I decided to try to switch to the pill (hated it) & then got back on Depo, which is when the weight gain happened.
7	655	Just hate the weight gain.
7	656	Ive experienced crazy weight gain, hair loss and my anxiety was bad before but now it is terrible where it is causing me to not even sleep at night anymore!
7	657	I've been on the shot for 2 years, I've experienced no weight gain or any of the other common side affects.
7	658	I have experience absolutely no bleeding since my first shot, got the second shot today and no weight gain (I do exercise daily).
7	659	Such as slight weight gain which I help to control with diet and exercise.
7	660	However the weight gain of 30 lbs now I need to lose 60lbs.
7	661	Some weight gain but I'm successfully burning that off.
7	662	I've been on the shot for 7 years, no cycle, no other children and no weight gain.
7	663	Weight gain is the only negative thing for me, which I don't really care for.
7	664	My mother is my doctor so she warned me about the weight gain.
7	665	I had mood swings, increased appetite and cravings, (which lead to a 10 lb weight gain within first 3 months), and constant bleeding for over 2 months.
7	666	I've been losing/gaining 20 pounds on and off many years before I started Depo, and considering I do not exercise I cannot blame any weight gain on this.
7	667	So I switched to the shot, the second month I was on my period for a full 30 days, which I was told was normal, after that I haven't had a period at all, I have had no side effects, no weight gain, and most importantly no pregnancy scares.
7	668	I have not had a period in years (before I had terribly heavy periods), I did not experience any weight gain, do not have trouble staying fit, and do not experience any mood/personality swings.
7	669	The only thing I HATED was the weight gain.
7	670	When I went to get the shot the nurse told me I may have no weight gain or cravings.
7	671	No weight gain, at least not yet.
7	672	Personally, my only downside is weight gain.
7	673	I've been on the Depo shot before and other than slight (maybe 3-5 lb) weight gain and slight mood changes I had no problems with it.
7	674	It was very effective & I didn't experience ANY weight gain (I lost weight).
7	675	Not only would certain ones contribute to a lot of weight gain or very bad mood swings, I was horrible with taking my birth control pill on time.
7	676	I've been on the shot for almost 3 years and it has been a good run; no period, no weight gain.
7	677	I'm noticing weight gain of course because I'm stuffing my face, but I'm miserable if I don't eat what I'm craving or when I'm hungry.
7	678	The weight gain has stopped at that but it's very disconcerting.
7	679	This month, however, I have experienced breast enlargement and soreness, along with weight gain from 6 days before my period started.
7	680	No weight gain.
7	681	The only negative thing I have to say is it does mess with my moods, like I'll get sad out of no where and start tripping and the weight gain I don't mind because I'm already a size 3, I want to gain some weight.
7	682	I didn't experience any weight gain, but I was also doubling my work-out time because of the appetite increase.
7	683	I felt depressed from the weight gain, I wasn't me anymore.
7	684	I have had no bleeding problems, no weight gain, or any bodily pain.
7	685	No weight gain or sickness.
7	686	No weight gain at all on it.
7	687	I have experienced a lot of weight gain and depression and tons of moods swings.
7	688	No periods, no mood swings, and no weight gain!
7	689	I suffered from depression and weight gain while I was coming off of it.
7	690	Pros:  no pregnancy; no weight gain; no period; didn't have to worry about taking a pill everyday.
7	691	Terrible weight gain.
7	692	I had a 5lb weight gain, which isn't so bad.
7	693	I was always moody and extremely tired and gained over 15 pounds!
7	694	But I gained a lot of weight!!
7	695	Made me super moody, and I gained 20 pounds since starting in January.
7	696	The main issue was that I gained weight on it.
7	697	But, I have gained 40 lbs since  then despite exercising a 3-5 times a week and controlled eating habits.
7	698	I gained 10 lbs those first few months.
7	699	However in the 2 doses that I had I gained 40 pounds.
7	700	I've also experienced a lot of binge eating on the shot but haven't gained weight.
7	701	MY SIDE EFFECTS: I gained 20 my normal average -30 pounds heaviest being unhealthy on depo.
7	702	However my last two years on the shot I gained 40 pounds.
7	703	I am constantly dizzy and fatigued and i gained lots of weight.
7	704	Maybe around the 6 or 7 month I stopped and just gained a massive amount of weight I was 170 and went all the way to 250 while I was playing sports and working out.
7	705	I gained 17 pounds, had horrible mood swings, was constantly crying and moody, and I had the worst constant breakouts.
7	706	I gained weight, became a blubbering mess of emotions, got pregnant, and had a miscarriage all while getting the shot exactly on time.
7	707	In all, when I was on the shot I probably gained a total of 10-15 pounds, which I can't fully blame the shot for.
7	708	I haven't gained much weight.
7	709	Over the course of 5 years, I have gained over 100 lbs, hair started greying early, loss of energy, loss of interest in life, and thinning hair, dry skin.
7	710	I gained 30 pounds from September to February.
7	711	But having a small stomach I only gained 5 pounds.
7	712	I have gained and lost (w/o exercising).
7	713	I gained so much during the injections.
7	714	Weight gained I can say I like to eat so I can't blame depo for that.
7	715	4 months after my first baby I was 10 lbs under pre-baby weight and by the time she was 6 months old I had gained some muscle back and looked and felt like myself again.
7	716	I have gained some weight in that time but that could easily be down to just growing up and life style choices.
7	717	But I never gained weight.
7	718	6 months in I gained 21 pounds.
7	719	My stress level has increased significantly and I've gained over 20 pounds since June 2016.
7	720	In that time she has gained 17 pounds where with her level of diet and exercise she should have been losing weight.
7	721	My friend and I started it around the same time and she was 123lbs, a year later she gained 36lbs and almost weighs 160lbs.
7	722	It was a great birth control to use, and if it wasnt for the weight I gained i would have continued it.
7	723	This time around was better, but I have gained weight I can't get rid of.
7	724	I've gained about 30 lbs in that time, but getting older and married may have done that.
7	725	The only "con" is that I have gained weight since I started taking this.
7	726	However I have gained about 15-20 pounds which is unfortunate because I used to always be my old certain weight.
7	727	I used to take birth control everyday because I had in regular periods and that would cause me ovary cystitis and yeah the birth control did get rid of that and   Regulate my period but oh my gosh, I gained so much weight and I was so mean and emotional that it was ridiculous.
7	728	I am 2 months into my first shot and have gained 5 pounds (my weight has not changed in years and I have maintained a good diet etc).
7	729	However while on the depo shot over 6 months i gained 45 pounds!
7	730	I've gained 20+ pounds & im extremely moody & tired all the time & I spit out of nowhere.
7	731	I also gained 25 pounds.
7	732	But I also had gained 45lbs after 2yrs!
7	733	Also, I rapidly gained 15-20 lbs.
7	734	I also had an increase in appetite which is probably why alot of people have gained weight.. im a health nut so appetite is something I control on a regular basis.
7	735	I am currently on birth control and have been for a little over a year I haven't had a period since I've had my son and I've gained a lot of weight I'm about to quit taking it and Im always stressed out and my hair is falling out a lot never done this before
7	736	I gained weight the first couple shots but now on my second year of getting them I lost weight and maintain it easily.
7	737	But I have been careful to not let this change the way I eat, and I have gained less than 5 pounds overall.
7	738	After taking Depo for a while I began to have back problems, bones sensitive, crazy mood swings, depressed, & gained a little over 20 pounds.
7	739	However, I gained about thirty five pounds on the shot.
7	740	I have gained a lot of weight, around 50 pounds to this day.
7	741	The first 2 shots, I had lost 15 lbs, and the second 2 shots I gained back that 15 lbs plus another 20.
7	742	I've gained a lot of weight well being on it because I seem to always be hungry.
7	743	I have 3 CONS 1) I have gained 20 lbs.
7	744	Skin was perfect, never gained weight (in fact, it seemed like I almost couldn't gain weight haha), and my emotions were totally level.
7	745	I gained weight, had chronic fatigue, "morning sickness", severe depression.
7	746	After one shot  was horribly moody, my skin broke out, and I gained weight.
7	747	Cons: I gained 40 pounds.
7	748	I also gained weight and it looks like I'm pregnant again.
7	749	So far I gained 10lbs.
7	750	I was also hungry all the time and probably gained 5lbs at most.
7	751	The cons were the weight I gained.
7	752	I have gained about 25 pounds, but that didnt happen until 2.5 months in.
7	753	And i quit antidepressants so that could have been why i gained weight.
7	754	Early October and I've gained about 13 pounds.
7	755	I haven't gotten my period since then, and I have only gained 10 pounds.
7	756	A year later and I gained 30 pounds.
7	757	I gained six pounds since then.
7	758	I have gained about 35 lbs mostly always hungry.
7	759	My mood swings were though the roof I gained 10-15 lbs I felt depressed.
7	760	My only slight issue is that I gained alot of weight (about 70 pounds).
7	761	Ive gained so much weight and were talking like 40 lbs.
7	762	This second round though, I have gained some weight which is no biggie because I do like my bigger butt lol.
7	763	I've gained 12 lbs.
7	764	Aside from that I gained about 30 pounds from the shot.
7	765	I've gained maybe 5 pounds since I've been in this .
7	766	The only bad side effect that I have had with this shot is I gained a little bit of my weight back.
7	767	During the first 4-5 months I lost 40 pounds, and slightly over a year later I've gained 20 back.
7	768	I have gained about 20 pounds!!!
7	769	I have gained back all the weight that I did lose from having my baby and am now stuck at the same weight I was at 9 months pregnant, it's awful and embarrassing, I am constantly hungry like constantly and I crave sweets and chocolate more than anything.
7	770	I gained 20 pounds,yet it definitely filled in my small body,I don't have a period any more but I always look and feel pregnant.
7	771	I gained about 40 pounds and I am having trouble losing it, but that is it.
7	772	I gained 40  pounds and experienced major emotional side effects.
7	773	Slowly but surely I started experiencing minor side effects which graduly became worse after the 3rd shot...OMG..i gained 26 pounds in 9 months, severe insomia , heart palpitations,hair loss, severe anxiety , arm pain shooting from my shoulder to my fingers, numbness and tingling on both arms, fatigue, depressed.
7	774	It is also a great birth control, personally I gained only alittle weight (5-7 pounds) but I liked it because I'm considered smaller than average.
7	775	Around year 19 I gained about 25 pounds (I went from 120 to about 145) it's still so worth it.
7	776	I've been on this birth control for 6 months and I've gained 40lbs.
7	777	And gained weight..
7	778	I'm 5'3 and haven't gained a pound from this shot yet.
7	779	Of course I gained a couple pounds but thats just a given.
7	780	I gained maybe five pounds so nothing drastic.
7	781	By the second shot, I gained 5lbs which I thought was odd but the doctor said it was normal.
7	782	I gained another 10 lbs.
7	783	I gained 40 pounds on Depo Provera shot.
7	784	I've gained 5-10 pounds over the course.
7	785	I gained a total of 40 pounds (in 6 months) due to the fact that I was hungry all the time.
7	786	I was on the shot for a little over 3 years I gained a total of 5 pounds being on the shot.
7	787	I weighed about 105lbs now I weigh 130lbs, I gained so much weight.
7	788	I gained about 3-5 lbs after every shot.
7	789	I gained maybe 2 pounds.
7	790	I've gained about 20 pounds and experience some pretty crazy mood swings.
7	791	I only gained about 3 pounds (I do work out 4/5 times a week).
7	792	I should point out, I frequently eat fast food and frozen pizzas, so that I'm willing to bet that's the reason I gained weight and the Depo had very little to do with it.
7	793	I've gained about 10 pounds and have a love/hate relationship with my newer curves (although I must say my boyfriend doesn't seem to mind them).
7	794	I, however, have gained about 25 pounds.
7	795	I just had my third shot, I only gained 2 lbs since the first shot and I no longer have a period.
7	796	I take my vitamin C and D. I've gained 3-5lbs, no difference.
7	797	However, I was on this for 4 years and gained at least 20 pounds.
7	798	I gained 10 lbs and haven't been able to get rid of it since.
7	799	I was off of it for about 5 months and just got back on it and in one week have gained 27lbs and get skin rashes pretty consistently now.
7	800	I have not gained any weight at all while on the shot and my weight has remained extremely constant.
7	801	However in the course of being on this shot I have gained 70 pounds.
7	802	I've gained almost 40 pounds...
7	803	Then to top it all off I gained about 15lbs while on this shot.
7	804	My period stopped completely and I gained no weight because of it.
7	805	Lost my period which is normal & gained 5 pounds.
7	806	Yes, I have gained some weight.
7	807	I was on it before (about 6 -7 yrs ago) and I gained weight, my hair fell out, etc etc.
7	808	After about 2 months I went to the doctor and I had gained 40 pounds.
7	809	Within 1 and 1/2 months I gained another 30.
7	810	So I had gained over 60 pounds.
7	811	I gained about 5 pounds but exercise and eat right helps.
7	812	Towards the end of that 2 years I realized I gained about 20lbs!!!!
7	813	I gained 40lbs withing the first 3 months.
7	814	I had terrible mood swings, and also gained weight.
7	815	I have also gained about 5lb since I've used it.
7	816	After using this for a while I gained about 20-30 lbs and had the hardest time losing it.
7	817	The only downsides are that I find myself constantly taking pregnancy tests because I'm afraid I may be pregnant and not know it, and I've gained about 60 lbs, although I can't say it was completely the shot's fault.
7	818	I am now looking for another form of birth control so that I will not be kept from losing weight, just in case I gained because of the shot.
7	819	I'm waiting to lose that weight they said I gained on it.
7	820	My appetite is enraged and I am having to be very careful about what I eat as I have already gained six pounds; I am worried that the fatigue is permanent as other women I have come across have permanent chronic fatigue.
7	821	My issue was I gained 30+ lbs and I was on it less than 1 year.
7	822	I have gained weight while on the shot but it could be just my eating habits and lack of exercise!
7	823	I gained a lot of weight, three stones and I had really bad mood swings when I was on it and they just were not getting any better so I decided to come off it December 2009.
7	824	I've now gained about 10-15 lbs.
7	825	I haven't gained weight and not having to take a pill everyday is really convenient, but overall it isn't worth it.
7	826	I also gained 20 Ibs and I know that was from the shot because I eat right and exercise.
7	827	But I haven't gained any weight, in fact I've lost 5 pounds but my only concern is my stomach pain, it gives me nausea.
7	828	I have gained a little weight, but that could also just be the fact that my metabolism has slowed since I'm getting older.
7	829	I never gained weight, although I should note that I have a very high metabolism.
7	830	It's now May & I'm due for my 2nd shot the last week of May however I started feeling very light head and nausea.
7	831	I woke up feeling the worst nausea every morning, to the point where I would sometimes vomit.
7	832	I was on aubra for about 2 weeks before I had to stop due to extreme nausea.
7	833	I didn't gain weight, I've struggled with mild depression, anxiety, poor appetite, fatigue, lots of nausea and abdominal pain.
7	834	I experienced extreme nausea for 2 or 3 days within the first 3 months of getting the injection.
7	835	They have been occurring multiple times per day including nausea and diarrhea.
7	836	Normally I get nauseous from birth control but the only con I've experienced was anxiety.
7	837	I'm also finding some foods I love, are making me nauseous and I've became slightly claustrophobic.
7	838	Mood swings all the time and constantly feel nauseous.
7	839	My blood sugar was dropping (I don't have any issues w that) I felt dizzy, And hot i couldn't stop the constant Hot flashes.
7	840	I also have head aches and get dizzy often and it has been hard for me to get wet since I started.
7	841	Feel dizzy when I'm laying down to go to sleep but its gone by morning.
7	842	I did get dizzy yesterday.
7	843	I DID experience more PMS (also known as random crying), tiredness, dizziness, and light bleeding between periods.
7	844	I don't recall many mood swing or depression.
7	845	I recently had child number two at age 22 so I dicided to try a new for of birth control was on the pill for two years but got pregnant on it so I got the shot on November 18 and started bleeding on December 1 and it now December 6 and I am still bleeding I am a bit worried seeing that its my first time on the shot I have a little mood swing and lost of energy and lost of appetite.
7	846	As far as side effects goes I’ve been having crazy mood swings.
7	847	I don't have mood swings, I don't have depression.
7	848	My mood swings are terrible, I was put on an anti depressant because it made my anxiety terrible, and the abnormal, random, heavy bleeding with no warning after being on it for almost a year SUCKED.
7	849	My mood swings are the WORST.
7	850	It will cause mood swings a week into getting it.
7	851	Major mood swings, constant exhaustion and trouble sleeping.
7	852	mood swings have been awful from angry to crying to anxious.
7	853	If I didn't get the shot right away, it caused some pretty awful mood swings if I didn't get it the first day possible.
7	854	But mood swings are pretty bad.
7	855	The mood swings have been out of control and ultimately I no longer feel like myself.
7	856	I started the shot in September and the first two months were fine, I didn't bleed at all but when I tell you I had major mood swings it was terrifying.
7	857	Crazy mood swings.
7	858	I'm still having mood swings, but those only seem to be during the week of when my shot is due.
7	859	mood swings and depression.
7	860	I experienced some of the worst mood swings EVER freaking out & feeling out of control of my body and emotions.
7	861	I'm always hungry irritated all the time and the worst mood swings.
7	862	The mood swings and depression.
7	863	They all made me have mood swings and depression, and I felt tired all the time.
7	864	I feel full of energy and I haven't had any mood swings and best thing is I haven't had a period since!!!!
7	865	My mood swings have been terrible...
7	866	However, I started noticing frequent mood swings and often feelings depressed.
7	867	The second shot (next 3 months) I bled the entire 3 months, started to gain weight and started to get mood swings .
7	868	My mood swings were awful and became much more depressed.
7	869	Mood swings weren't that much of a deal.
7	870	Also, I went from being one of the happiest people, to majorly depressed with anxiety and mood swings.
7	871	Overall the only side effects I experienced were anxiety, mood swings, a long period and, I would sometimes get short but sharp back aches.
7	872	I see other people have had side effects of bleeding, tiredness, mood swings, and depression.
7	873	Between the 3rd shot and now, 7 1/2 years later, no period or mood swings.
7	874	Going through depression , horrible mood swings.
7	875	I started taking the Depo shot when I was 17, however it did help effectively with me not getting pregnant, and I did not have any periods for four years, but it caused me to have crazy mood swings, insane depression, and made me feel down all the time.
7	876	The worst part about it was the effect it had on my mood swings.
7	877	I have definitely had some mood swings.
7	878	For 3 months my mood swings were unbarreable!
7	879	Cramps 24/7, mood swings were terribly crazy.
7	880	I don't recall having any mood swings.
7	881	I can't deal with my severe mood swings!
7	882	I haven't had any mood swings or anything.
7	883	Not only hair loss, I had terrible terrible mood swings.
7	884	I am not going back for my second shot, the hair loss and mood swings is not worth it.
7	885	Very few mood swings.
7	886	I had pretty intense mood swings, but I was also In a very unstable relationship at the time so I'm not going to pin the mood swings entirely on the depo.
7	887	I had many anxiety episodes and mood swings.
7	888	This medicine made me have really bad mood swings.
7	889	I never noticed any major mood swings aside from the emotional being I already am (know yourself!).
7	890	I also experienced severe hair loss, weakness and fatigue (probably due to blood loss), as well as terrible mood swings.
7	891	I had major mood swings but am now on another medication to help control that.
7	892	My mood swings are unreal and my breasts have been so tender to the point where I can't touch them at all and they've grown a ton.
7	893	No mood swings, no period.
7	894	It actually hasn't given me any bad side effects beside loss of hair, I haven't lost a lot a hair, and mood swings.
7	895	I'm happy because there's no mood swings or really any mental side effects which is why I switched from the pill.
7	896	No bad mood swings!
7	897	My mood swings make me feel like I am crazy!
7	898	Severe mood swings, depression, anxiety, hair loss, osteoporosis, infertility, etc.
7	899	The worst of all though are my constant mood swings.
7	900	Depression isn't really an issue but it comes with my mood swings.
7	901	I suffered with painful periods and ovulation and terrible mood swings which all got worse after having my kids.
7	902	However, I have noticed I've lost some of my hair, my depression worsened and I experience major mood swings from time to time; I didn't gain any weight.
7	903	I haven't had any mood swings or emotional break-downs like the other pills did to me!
7	904	I had crazy mood swings and would start crying for no reason at all.
7	905	I also experience mood swings that I couldn't seem to control.
7	906	The mood swings are 100 times worse then PMS after those first few days.
7	907	The only problem I have had with the shot is that I have *definitely* experienced mood swings.
7	908	I have had only two shots and have horrible mood swings, I'm ALWAYS angry or upset at something and I've lost all desire for sex putting a strain on my relationship.
7	909	I would have stayed on the Depo regardless of the bleeding, but it was the horrible mood swings that made me stop using it.
7	910	I also have mood swings at times.
7	911	I didn't have mood swings and didn't have a period.
7	912	First week or so I had mood swings but that was all.
7	913	I have taken a bone density test about 3-6 months ago and my bones were great; you just have to make sure you are taking calcium and vitamin D. The only negative side of using Depo for me are the mood swings that happen after I get the shot and last for about a week or two.
7	914	I also have horrible mood swings now.
7	915	I am just now starting to get over the mood swings and depression.
7	916	I never got a period, no mood swings, a little weight loss, it was amazing.
7	917	few side effects,  Slight mood change, and tingling/ numbness in fingers and feet.
7	918	I feel like I've become a completely different person with all these mood changes and fatigue.
7	919	The depo shot is extremely effective, however I had the horrible experience of mood changes.
7	920	The mood changes had me crying daily and arguing with everyone around me.
7	921	Mood changes.
7	922	I'm 21 and I just hit the two year mark, and my doctor recommended that I switch to a different BC this month and I'm so sad and nervous...
7	923	I will be switching to mirena and am VERY nervous to try something different.
7	924	I'm nervous about my fertility and the constant two weeks of bleeding.
7	925	I heard your body starts to adjust to these symptoms after a while though, but I got too nervous about not getting my period every month, so I switched back to the pill.
7	926	Also, I'm nervous about the decrease of my bone density.
7	927	If you are not nervous around needles and would like a birth control that you really don't have to think about - I would highly recommend this method.
7	928	I am nervous but so far I heard Implanon is the best birth control.
7	929	I have always had problems with feeling depressed but ever since I got on this shot I've been feeling so horribly suicidal and anxious, my mood has been affected so badly too.
7	930	Between the night sweats, vivid dreams and being anxious I probably sleep two hours a night and I have a 5 month old son who sleeps all night.
7	931	I did fell anxious the first few days, but that went away.
7	932	I am so anxious about having children.
7	933	The only reason I give it a 8 is because it made my anxiety come back.
7	934	I switched from the pill to depo because the pills gave me horrible anxiety and depression.
7	935	I experienced shortness of breath , depression, anxiety , pelvic pain , stiffness in muscles ( which was awful because I was a dancer ) tiredness and a huge increase in appetite.
7	936	It has caused me to have severe anxiety and panic attacks.
7	937	But none of that compares to the anxiety.
7	938	I started having nightmares and my anxiety was worse but I still decided to go on with my 2nd.
7	939	I haven't felt like myself in months and even the smallest amount of stress will get to me and cause an anxiety attack or depression.
7	940	If you already suffer from anxiety, DO NOT TAKE THIS SHOT.
7	941	I have regular anxiety and depression also It's literally ruining my life!
7	942	I was without the shot for almost a year and when I started taking it again I had extreme anxiety (I still do I just stopped taking the shot) I have had weight loss and gain.
7	943	I have gotten anxiety I dont wanna do anything besides be in my house ive never been this kind of person and its scary...
7	944	I already live with anxiety & depression and the Depo just makes it so much more worse!
7	945	Prior to taking it, I was having problems with anxiety and infrequent panic attacks following his birth; as, I assume, many new mothers do.
7	946	Also caused my anxiety to become worse.
7	947	Since using depo I have been diagnosed with anxiety and outrageous depression to the point I'm on meds...
7	948	I been having severe anxiety.
7	949	I came down with severe anxiety and depression.
7	950	I have had anxiety and stress.
7	951	I took it for 6 months only problem is it gave me severe anxiety so I had to stop.
7	952	Other than anxiety it was great.
7	953	Three months later and a ton of anxiety attacks and bleeding, I'm in the office going back on my pill.
7	954	I got severely depressed and had high anxiety and would lash out a lot.
7	955	I became insanely depressed and had anxiety I could not handle.
7	956	It took MONTHS to get back to some type of normal and even now, a year and a few months later, I still get AWFUL anxiety during my period and when I'm ovulating.
7	957	Prior to the Depo Provera I never had depression or anxiety.
7	958	I also noticed an increase in extreme depression and anxiety.
7	959	I decided on the shot there and then but then read more reviews after I got it that freaked me out - depression, loss of sex-drive, anxiety, etc.
7	960	When I really started getting concerned was when I started twitching and would goult out of my sleep with anxiety attacks..I had chest pains n poking sensations in my heart...I had no clue it was really from the shot till I decided to skip my next appointment and With in days of not getting the next dose I started feeling so much better..the shot is POISON!!!
7	961	The only downside is the depression and anxiety, but those are occasional.
7	962	I had anxiety before but now it's so much worse.
7	963	I already suffer from some anxiety issues which Depo-Provera has intensified but I expected this.
7	964	I recently just got the second shot and the amount of anxiety attacks are ridiculous.
7	965	Before I took the shot, I rarely had anxiety.
7	966	First time was bad I had really bad anxiety and moodiness, which at first I thought it was hormones from having the baby.
7	967	I am now period and yeast infection free.
7	968	At the suggestion of my OBGYN, for recurrent vaginal yeast infections that seemed to come 2 weeks after every single period for no reason.
7	969	I decided to do the depo shot to keep my hormones high and potentially stop my period to hopefully end the yeast infections.
7	970	The yeast infections stopped, so it worked in that sense.
7	971	I don't get a period and because of that I always have yeast infections.
7	972	I decided along with my doctor to get the Shot because i have what is called bacterial vaginosis, cysts on my ovaries and also constant yeast infections.
7	973	Which is a HUGE deal for someone who has suffered from yeast infections 1x a month for the past 4 years as well as heavy painful periods.
8	1	I struggled with acne a lot through my teens and early twenties (2 rounds of Accutane), but now I have it mostly cleared up.
8	2	This pill had no effect on my acne.
8	3	I had little to no acne before starting this pill and it caused me to start breaking out with cystic acne all around my mouth and chin.
8	4	My fiancé has noticed that I become more irritable lately and I have a bit of acne, but my bloating and cramping has gone away, and I have had no problem with cravings or weight gain.
8	5	I've had pretty much no negative side effects other than a mild nausea after the first few pills in a new pack, and it's helped a lot with my acne.
8	6	I felt nauseous in the morning the first few days, my skin did clear but I am not sure if it is due to the drug or my acne cream clindamyicin.
8	7	It cleared my acne and made my periods lighter.
8	8	I've had terrible mood swings acne break outs terrible cramping to the point of going to the hospital thinking something was wrong with me.
8	9	That being said, my acne is gone and I'm not pregnant and my cramping is minimal.
8	10	I noticed I haven't gotten as much acne since I started.
8	11	No acne, no nausea, no weight gain, no mood swings.
8	12	Since I've started taking this pill my mood has been all over the place, I've been crying, and sad all the time, and I'm a really happy person, I never have acne and now I have acne is really bad I feel bad!
8	13	For me, this pill cleared almost all my acne, I haven't gained weight, my super painful cramps have almost vanished, my flow isn't as heavy, the only real bad side effect I have noticed is the mood swings, but even those are not that bad.
8	14	It cleared my acne very well, it worked perfectly to prevent pregnancy (noted that I NEVER missed a pill and was NEVER more than 3 hours late.)
8	15	Only reason I'm taking bc is for hormonal acne & let me tell you this stuff works!!
8	16	A few weeks after starting this, I developed the most painful cystic acne of my life.
8	17	I've always had mild acne so I can't tell if it is from this pill or not, but I constantly have pimples on my face and a few on my chest.
8	18	So far, I have not gotten pregnant, and my severe back acne has completely cleared up.
8	19	It's basically ruined our relationship , the pill isn't great and doesn't help acne at all
8	20	My acne is awful and my boobs doubled in size from swelling.
8	21	I was fine on the Sprintec but on this stuff - I've had HORRIBLE mood swings, my acne is out of control, spotting, nausea, weight gain, headaches.
8	22	I was once switched to the brand name but had bad acne because of it and was switched back to Sprintec.
8	23	I have been taking it for 12 days - The acne I have gotten in the past 12 days is out of control.
8	24	Deep, cystic acne that I have never experienced in my life, all over my face and down my neck and arms.
8	25	I am 26 years old and I have pubescent acne all of the sudden.
8	26	My acne has decreased slightly, not much.
8	27	It helped my acne for a little while and now it has returned.
8	28	I am just too scared to stop taking it or start taking something new because of my acne.
8	29	I occasionally get one or two pimples a couple of days before my period begins.
8	30	I've also never had problems with my skin (maybe 1 pimple every month) and I now have 4 pimples on my face and some on my body and back.
8	31	I used to get 4-5 pimples at a time but now I have none at all!
8	32	My Dr. put me on this to help with severe period cramps and possible endometriosis diagnosis.
8	33	I don't get cramps during my period but now during ovulation I get slight cramps.
8	34	I had a very timely period with heavy bleeding the first 2 days and terrible cramps some cycles.
8	35	Only thing that it did not solve was my awful period cramps.
8	36	My girlfriend just got done with her first week and she has had to take 2 days off of school so far because her cramps are so severe.
8	37	The only issue I have is so far instead of 4-5 day periods, my last one was 8 days, but I did notice my cramps were lighter.
8	38	I get HORRIBLE cramps the day before my period and the first day that it starts.
8	39	I also experienced a lot of cramping.
8	40	My periods now last roughly 3 days, and I don’t have any cramping symptoms anymore.
8	41	I have experienced about 15 lbs in weight gain, I have horrible mood swings the week before my period & terrible cramping.
8	42	I experienced three and one half weeks of spotting and horrible cramping while on the pill.
8	43	I have been on this pill for less then a month, I'm at the end of the 3rd active week and this whole week I been spotting and cramping and some discharge that I never had problems with before.
8	44	I started taking birth control to help with my cramping I get in my thighs only, I'm not sexually active, no kids.
8	45	First day of taking the pill yesterday,  it helped my mood swing's but brought on the cramping and made it worse.
8	46	But my only problem would be that I get really bad cramping stomach aches about everyday.
8	47	Also some light spotting and cramping.
8	48	I have had spotting for 2 weeks nonstop and I have not felt like myself since taking this.
8	49	My periods were shortened usually 3 days max....until last week I was spotting for about 2 weeks.
8	50	My periods are one day of spotting, two regular days (only have to change my pad every 8 hours really) and another 2 days where I just wear a liner.
8	51	Only thing is on previfem I had NO period it was like spotting & on this bc its a bit heaver but nothing like my regular flow.
8	52	I took the pill 2 months and experienced severe mood swings, nausea/vomiting, head aches, and spotting.
8	53	Omg horrible I have been getting breakthrough bleeding and here I am today on my second week and I am spotting..... not only that but I can cry on the dime and it is so annoying I called my doctor today and they're switching me to Ortho Tri-Cyclen
8	54	I have been sick since the first night, extreme abdominal pain, nausea, spotting, dizziness and headaches.
8	55	Along with the weight gain I spot for a week before my period, then my period lasts me a week.
8	56	I spotted for the first week and then stopped completely for a couple of days.
8	57	I was violently nauseated, same headache.
8	58	This one is the worst nightmare I took two pills over  two days and I'm so sick I'm vomiting, nauseous, dizzy, headache, I can't even put my head up, I also have chills I feel horrible.
8	59	I've only been on this pill for about a week and every morning I'd wake up with a headache I caught myself always having an attitude and when im alone I'd just cry for no reason I wouldn't take this pill
8	60	That is not all I thought I had some kind of stomach virus for a moth and it wasn't going away, nauseous, vomiting, dizziness and severe headache.
8	61	Felt very nauseous and light headed and bad headaches.
8	62	I work with little kids so I though I was getting sick from them, but I've had headaches and stomachs almost constantly.
8	63	I feel swollen and bloated constantly and I have headaches almost every day.
8	64	I was crying and I had a migraine at work which is hard to explain to my co-workers and makes me look bad.
8	65	My sex drive has decreased, probably due to my constant sobbing.
8	66	For sure great at birth control , sex drive is gone, dryness and at time discomfort.
8	67	However, it gave me mood swings, extremely sore nipples, high irritability, loss of sex drive and decreased my appetite.
8	68	I haven't had sex since I started this pill because my sex drive is totally gone.
8	69	My sex drive has increased a significant amount.
8	70	I've had months with break-thru bleeding (like 3 weeks of bleeding vs at most 1...), I've put on about 10 lbs, I have no desire to do anything but eat and not workout (not like myself AT ALL) and no libido.
8	71	Extreme weight gain and loss every other month, loss of appetite, loss of libido, and EXTREME mood swings.
8	72	The holiday season just finished and I ate like a slob and gained weight BUT I just got off my period..so I am hoping that weight gain isn’t the P word!!!
8	73	I have been on Estarylla for about 4 months and I have gained about 20 pounds (keep in mind I run at least 10 miles a week along with weight training 5-6 times a week) so this weight gain is absurd.
8	74	Mind you, I am normally very active (I teach cycle class 5 days a week) and eat healthy, but this the weight gain is crazy!
8	75	No weight gain & have a ton of energy.
8	76	I was on ortho tricyclen after the first kid and had weight gain and my face broke out so bad.
8	77	I experienced side effects of depression and suicidal thoughts, anxiety and a panic attack, frequent breakthrough bleeding, breast tenderness, and weight gain of 10 pounds.
8	78	I am not prone to weight gain and haven't had this issue or emotional issues with the other 2 birth control pills I've taken.
8	79	I got on the pill for weight gain and still no change.
8	80	I've gained some weight and I'm more emotional then I've ever been but other then that I'm still not pregnant it's been a month and a week.
8	81	Also gained 10 pounds in 3 weeks!
8	82	Been on this for one month and I've gained 6 lbs!
8	83	I have gained a little weight, but it's probably my eating habits and not the pill.
8	84	I haven't gained any weight or experienced any type of emotional side effects.
8	85	I haven't gained any weight.
8	86	But I was taking the higher version I guess which is tri-sprintec for a year, I never had a single issue with I might've gained 5 unnoticeable pounds.
8	87	My skins broken out, I gained 10 lbs.
8	88	I gained 5 lbs.
8	89	I have been on it for about 10 months now and I gained 10 pounds.
8	90	The only reason I've gained 10 lbs in the last 3 years is from crossfit and it was muscle.
8	91	I have gained weight, but most birth controls do that.
8	92	On Previfem I gained about 10 pounds and on this new pill I have lost it all.
8	93	I've gained 6 pounds and my overall mood is terrible.
8	94	I've been on this birthcontrol for 3 weeks and I feel sick all the time and nausea after I eat.
8	95	I've had some nausea but not enough to actually puke.
8	96	Since starting this medication I've had horrible nausea and the need to drink a lot of water.
8	97	It's an aching pain with nausea.
8	98	The only experience with nausea and this pill are when I have taken it mid day and eat absolutely nothing.
8	99	I've had crazy mood swings, depression, Fatigue, bleeding, nausea day and waking me up at night, and to make it worse I've am broken out worse than I have been in years.
8	100	From the first day I tried this BC I've had complete nausea and lost of appetite.
8	101	I'm not pregnant however the nausea is unbearable will stop taking.
8	102	Two weeks before my period I become so nauseous I cannot get out of bed.
8	103	I’m EXTRA moody, unhappy, extremely irritable, zero patience, nauseous a lot of the time on top of already having acid reflux, anxious.
8	104	I started taking it and I have been so nauseous and vomited twice last night.
8	105	When I start a new pack, I always get a little nauseous and  I bloat easily.
8	106	This pill actually made me depressed and anxious and nauseous to the point where I couldn't function.
8	107	I took it for two years when I was first prescribed it because I never actually associated the symptoms to the pill until one day I brought up how I was nauseous all the time to my doctor and she recommended me switching pills.
8	108	It did prevent pregnancy, but literally whenever I would take even the tiniest drink of any kind of alcohol I'd be nauseous for the rest of the night.
8	109	One side effect I've noticed is that I feel a little nauseous the first few days of starting a pack- nothing serious though.
8	110	In the first month I found myself getting slightly nauseous every time I took the pill and that I was getting moodier.
8	111	The first week or so I was nauseous & did throw up, it felt like motion sickness but it only happened twice.
8	112	I have NEVER had any side effects from any other pill but these make me nauseous and lightheaded about a half hour after I take them and it lasts all day.
8	113	My regular birth control made me nauseous at first but not bad at all but this stuff actually made me feel like I was going to die
8	114	I felt foggy, anxious, my palms were clammy and I was very dizzy.
8	115	My extreme mood swings was ruining my life and ruining my relationship.
8	116	Started in June of last year and I never had any bad side effects except maybe mood swings.
8	117	This medication makes me very prone to panic attacks, mood swings, and depressed states.
8	118	I know medications affect people differently, but from seeing the other reviews just be warned that this pill can increase depression, mood swings, anxiety, etc.
8	119	I don't really have bad mood swings.
8	120	This birth control has given me the worst experience I've ever had with mood swings.
8	121	It was a dark brown color and I stopped taking the pill after that experience and because of the mood swings.
8	122	The past year has been so bad for my mental and physical health due to intense fatigue, mood swings, anxiety over the smallest things and insomnia which then reacts to my body being tired and makes me restless.
8	123	I haven't experienced mood swings like everyone else posted about.
8	124	I started taking this pill after my 2nd baby I noticed mood swings but I thought it was just my hormones after having a baby but it got worse, after a month of been on this pill I was either angry or sad all the time, very unhappy I refused to believe that it could be depression but i started to find my self crying in my room alone, anxious just not feeling myself.
8	125	I have not experienced mood swings unless about to start my period.
8	126	MOOD SWINGS ARE NONSTOP.
8	127	The first week everything was fine, but over the course of two weeks I've had extreme mood swings that just kept progressing to the point that I couldn't stand to be near my two year old.
8	128	My mood swings have been horrible and I am exhausted at the end of the day.
8	129	My mood swings are awful, I am constantly angry, it makes me sick, makes my whole body tingle.. DO NOT TAKE THIS!
8	130	Although I'm not pregnant, it has given me EXTREME mood swings.
8	131	I haven't had any real mood changes save for being overly sensitive and crying at the drop of a hat.
8	132	I was nervous getting back on it since I was on B-Yaz before and it was horrible for me.
8	133	When I read these reviews, I was really nervous about starting this.
8	134	I was nervous to start it after reading all these bad reviews but it has worked fine for me.
8	135	I was already nervous considering there have been minimal positive reviews.
8	136	15 minutes after popping it in my mouth I'm anxious, paranoid, and sobbing over the smallest things.
8	137	I've been very anxious and feel fatigued and have no appetite at all.
8	138	If you want to feel paranoid, confused, like the worst bitch, anxious and destroy every relationship that's dear to you----> take this stuff!
8	139	Once I got off this pill, I immediately felt happier and less anxious.
8	140	This is seriously the worst birth control I've been on I can't even finish the pack I feel so sick and anxious all the time.
8	141	My depression and anxiety is at an all time high, and my relationship is now suffering
8	142	I get anxiety and feel worried all the time and never can be truly happy or enjoy anything.
8	143	I have diagnosed depression and anxiety, and haven't had an issue with it getting any worse.
8	144	After reading reviews, I realized it has made me moodier and made my anxiety worse.
8	145	After I started taking this medicine I started having crazy anxiety after my baby was born!!!
8	146	So then I got put on anti depressants but at the same time my anxiety had not gone away and also my blood pressure was getting higher!!!
8	147	I suffer from manic depression, anxiety and insomnia so I never thought anything else was making it worse until just recently I thought about how the week of green pills that are non-hormonal maybe effecting my mood.
9	1	I've tried multiple birth control pills and the mirena, all of which either gave me horrible acne, mood swings, constant bleeding, or abdominal pain.
9	2	The only side effects I've had are a higher appetite, slightly increased hair growth where I don't want it, and now that it cleared my facial acne, I have it on my butt.. never had to use face wash on my butt before now..
9	3	After I stopped using Generes, I have had the worst cystic acne on my face and body.
9	4	I have been off of the pill for over a year and I still have terrible acne problems.
9	5	I've never had a real acne problem until I got on this pill at 20.
9	6	I've been on it for 4 months and have has non-stop cystic acne.
9	7	This acne has been not only on my face, but also on my neck, chest, back, and butt.
9	8	I didn't have any weight gain and it cleared up acne.
9	9	After being on four different types of birth control pills in 3 1/2 yrs and having HORRIBLE side effects ranging from acne, hair falling out, spotting for months, to anxiety, to stroke-like sypmtoms and going to the ER, my OBGYN suggested Generess FE.
9	10	No acne, no weight gain, no mood swings, great energy, normal appetite, etc.
9	11	Cleared my acne, no pain, my breasts actually got bigger.
9	12	I  had acne before but after I started taking the pill it cleared up a lot.
9	13	No weight gain, no acne, no episodes of mood swings except period PM symptoms but those are normal.
9	14	I have mild to little cramps, some nausea but no acne or weight gain.
9	15	I've experienced no weight gain or acne, or anything like that.
9	16	I see the same symptoms of PMS when I'm reaching the placebo pills (emotions are high, sometimes acne, the normal stuff), but I never go through a period at all anymore.
9	17	I can't stop eating, my face never breaks out and as of now it's acne central, I've been throwing up and I can't even go to work without getting immediately annoyed.
9	18	I started Generess Fe 3 weeks ago, and at first I was extremely wary; I had reviews about unstoppable weight gain, terrible mood swings, breakthrough bleeding, acne worsening, and headaches, so I was on the edge.
9	19	The first 3 days my face broke out the worst it had since middle school, and I was so upset about it because I had spent so much time and money to good skin, but after about a week and a half or two, my face has completely cleared up, since then I actually have less small acne then when I wasn't on BC.
9	20	I use to suffer from migraines, horrible acne, and cysts in my breasts because most estrogen/hormone levels were too high in other pills, but Generess is so low that it has solved all those issues.
9	21	No problems with acne.
9	22	For me, that manifested itself in painful acne deep under my skin on my chin for 2 months on any new pill.
9	23	weight gain, acne (I NEVER breakout).
9	24	I'm 21, breaking out worse than I did even going through puberty.
9	25	I'm not breaking out as much anymore.
9	26	Terrible mood swings, bloated all the time, face constantly breaking out (after contraception,  I'm taking it too clear my face), mild weight gain, very light periods- if any, SEVERE nausea and constipated since the day I started the medication.
9	27	I've had cramps for three days straight and a fever.
9	28	Other than that my scalp hair is growing super fast, I haven't have a cycle in 2 years ( thats how long I've been on it ) my skin is super clear, no cramps.
9	29	I do have cramps a lot only on period though.
9	30	Still have cramps sometimes, but they're not as bad as they used to be.
9	31	Before taking birth control, I often got severe menstrual cramps, but with no periods on the pill, I had no cramps at all.
9	32	No cramps nothing it was wonderful.
9	33	And have had the cramps every day for the last 3 weeks.
9	34	My period lasts from 2 to 3 days, very very light, no cramps.
9	35	The only thing I've noticed is that I have cramps now before my period which I didn't have before.
9	36	Breasts are so tender and painful and horrible low back cramps during the 3rd week.
9	37	I no longer have extreme mood swings, no more painful cramps, and I can't believe it!
9	38	I am almost done with the first pack (I am on the brown pills) and can honestly say I am not sure if I am even going to wait to see if it helps my cramps, which is the whole reason I got on birth control in the first place.
9	39	I used to have really bad cramps and migraines.
9	40	I've always had terrible cramps, but thought that was normal and I had to deal with it.
9	41	Once on this pill, not only did my cramps get even worse, my breast were so tender I could barely put a bra on.
9	42	Originally I was put on it to help decrease my terrible cramps and throbbing migraines.
9	43	However starting in January, my migraines started coming back, in February debilitating cramps came back.
9	44	My periods have come like clockwork, and my cramps are not nearly as bad as they used to be.
9	45	Occasionally a headache and mild cramps.
9	46	After 4 days of taking it, I had a heavy period and terrible cramps that lasted for 5 days.
9	47	The cramps was gone and the heavy period went away, but after 2 days I had the medium bleeding again and the cramps.
9	48	And now I am on my 2nd brown pill and I have cramps and moderate bleeding.
9	49	I don't have cramps, but I am VERY moody.
9	50	This is the first birth control that has reduced any cramping at all, and now I barely get cramps.
9	51	Had a very heavy & long period with cramps and nausea.
9	52	I took this as directed on the first day of my period, and my normal cycle I have three days of light bleeding, and a day, maybe two of heavy bleeding with one day of cramping, then a few more days of light bleeding.
9	53	So far I have had a shorter and lighter period with much less cramping.
9	54	This pill works great, I've been taking it for months however I am now starting to feel really intense cramping and bleeding.
9	55	I do still have some cramping the week before, but even than is better than before.
9	56	Started cramping the very next day after taking the pills.
9	57	I experience very little cramping and mood change.
9	58	I get severe cramping and bloating for up to two weeks and have tried many different pills with NO luck.
9	59	I was nauseous pretty much 24/7 and spotting for a while nonstop, but it's totally worth it.
9	60	I may get brown spotting every 4-5 months.
9	61	I did have spotting in between periods the first couple months but that has stopped now.
9	62	There's no spotting or discharge for me.
9	63	You could see spotting and side effects for a couple months.
9	64	However, if you take the pill properly at the exact same time every day then these symptoms such as spotting will go away.
9	65	The only side effect I've had is light spotting here and there, but it's a very very minor inconvenience compared to all the positive things.
9	66	I had random spotting a couple times a week, so it was like I was constantly on my period.
9	67	On occasion I've experienced spotting or irregular periods because I've forgotten to take it once or twice.
9	68	The first 4 months I had some spotting and headaches(only the first 2 months), periods were a bit painful.
9	69	Since month 5 and now 6 I feel absolutely fine, no spotting at all, ok periods lasting about 3 days.
9	70	My only concern is the light spotting between periods, but my doctor warned me that this would happen.
9	71	The first 5 or 6 months I experienced some spotting mid month, but it wasn't unbearable and eventually subsided.
9	72	Other than that, very slight weight gain and no spotting.
9	73	Was put on Generess Fe to regulate spotting I have had for 3 months(PCOS).
9	74	Then I started the second week and started spotting.
9	75	During the placebo days, I did not get my period/breakthrough bleeding, but now that I am stopping the medication [for unrelated reasons] I suddenly have a tiny bit of spotting.
9	76	For the first 4-5 months I had irregular spotting, sometimes that went on for 6-7 days!
9	77	I simply do not have them, ever, not even spotting, and I am only 20 years old.
9	78	I switched from Loestrin 24 FE a couple of days ago because I randomly started to have a lot of spotting, Generess was the next pill my Gyno recommended.
9	79	I've been spotting consistently since the end of June 2013.
9	80	I have had troubles finding a pill that would not give me heavy spotting for months.
9	81	I did have nausea and breast tenderness for the first few weeks and slight spotting.
9	82	Unfortunately, I began spotting heavily during my first run.
9	83	From then on I have been spotting every time I run.
9	84	Other than the issue I had with spotting, this pill is pretty good.
9	85	Breast tenderness,  a lot of spotting on the 1st month.
9	86	My periods have become very light (almost just spotting) and short (2 days on average) and not enough for a tampon, just a light pad is needed.
9	87	Light spotting in the first 3 months which is a side effect but then never again after that.
9	88	Besides mild break through spotting at times, I have been very pleased with the results of this birth control.
9	89	I also had problems with spotting on other birth control pills, but not on this one.
9	90	Now my period is barely spotting.
9	91	I love this birth control because I has a constant hormone dose, so I never spot anymore.
9	92	And for the first month, I spotted for 1 day and I didn't have my period for the whole time I was on the pill.
9	93	I talked to my doctor and she told me that it was fine as long as I spotted every 3 months and that is what ended up happening.
9	94	I spotted every day till about the end of the pack.
9	95	Within the first month I spotted for two weeks, then it subsided for about a week.
9	96	Then I spotted for another two weeks, and this just kept happening.
9	97	Finally, into the fourth pack I noticed I hadn't spotted in a while and was very happy.
9	98	Had a very slight headache for about 4 pills in.
9	99	No weight gain (other than in my chest), nausea, headaches, no "foggy" feeling at all.
9	100	Ive had headaches daily since Day 1.
9	101	First 2-3 days I had terrible headaches, which went away but came back during the placebo pills.
9	102	Took Maxalt for the headaches, helped.
9	103	I have only been taking it for 3 days and immediately nausea, headaches, and mood swings have hit me hard!
9	104	So many women complained of headaches, severe nausea, and increased appetite yet I have experienced NONE.
9	105	My first month I had EXTREMELY bad migraines but not any more.
9	106	I get migraines if I take placebos so I skip those every other month and go to a new packet.
9	107	I have a history of migraines, but only with light/noise sensitivity, no aura.
9	108	My sex drive was always very high even before birth control, and that certainly hasn't changed.
9	109	I've also gained weight, have an increase in body hair, and my sex drive is completely gone.
9	110	The main reason I'm switching is because my sex drive is virtually non-existent, and my Dr. said that is because the Generess levels you out (because it is super low in estrogen), so you don't get the "highs" you would get with some other BC pills or without BC.
9	111	I think my sex drive has gone down a little but it isn't that noticeable.
9	112	At first I was happy with it, then came the almost complete loss of sex drive.
9	113	No mood swings, and gained my sex drive is back 100%!
9	114	I was on this for a year and experienced weight gain, loss of sex drive, depression, thinning hair, and my hormone levels dropped (estrogen, testosterone, cortisol).
9	115	I've also noticed that I have actually been in a better mood and had an increased sex drive, (which is good for me because LoEstrin decreased it).
9	116	For the first two weeks I was extremely nauseous, once that died down my breasts were sore and grew from a small B to a full C, at that time my sex drive dramatically decreased and I became very moody which never really stopped.
9	117	I've also experienced an increased sex drive, not decreased.
9	118	The only negative side effect I had was that it did slow down my libido.
9	119	The only downside is super low libido but that's about it, no other side effects for me.
9	120	I feel hungry alot and my libido could be better.
9	121	I very rarely get a period (5'4, 115 pounds) and had no weight gain that I can attribute to the pill.
9	122	Even during that crazy pre-wedding time, there wasn't any weight gain or crazy mood swings (I was slightly nauseous the first few days, but it was very temporary).
9	123	I gained maybe 5 pounds, but I am also in a happy relationship so weight gain could be from that.
9	124	I have not had any emotional swings or weight gain.
9	125	I am very pleased with the pill and have not experienced any nausea, weight gain, or break outs.
9	126	I also had some weight gain as well, probably about 7-10 pounds in 6 months.
9	127	I have had no issues with weight gain and it took a couple months for my body to get used to it.
9	128	So of course I know it works differently for everybody, but don't be scared of the weight gain myth, I really didn't notice any problems with that.
9	129	The only side effects I have experienced so far (knock on wood) is I am a bit more touchy on certain days or even random days, and I have a good bit more of the munchies or cravings, but otherwise no weight gain or crazy moods.
9	130	My body did not react in a negative way and I have not had any problems with weight gain.
9	131	But then, weight gain occurred and I gained almost 15 pounds in a month.
9	132	Also, no weight gain.
9	133	I did notice a small weight gain - 5 lbs is all.
9	134	The only side effect for me is weight gain, which is actually a good thing for me because I'm very active.
9	135	I am seeing a little weight gain, however my breasts have started at a C and are now a D. I think I am switching off of this though simply due to cost per month.
9	136	Weight gain.
9	137	This pill doesn't directly cause weight gain, but definitely made my appetite increase.
9	138	Mild weight gain (maybe 5 lbs - probably just normal from eating anyway).
9	139	I have also noticed weight gain (probably around 10-15 lbs within the first couple of weeks), my breasts are constantly tender and I'm depressed and tired much of the time.
9	140	I noticed significant weight gain in that short amount of time.
9	141	I may have had some weight gain.
9	142	Never gained weight, never changed my appetite, nothing.
9	143	My appetite has spiked, I've gained about 8 lbs, and can't seem to get it off with my usual gym/boxing class regimen, I already practice a mostly yeast-free eating lifestyle and still nothing helped.
9	144	No joke, I gained over 50 pound in the year and change I was on this, and I can't attribute more than maybe 5 or 10 pounds to lifestyle changes.
9	145	I never gained weight - I've actually lost 10 pounds and my boobs feel fuller.
9	146	Within the first month I gained almost 10 pounds.
9	147	As soon as I switched to a different forumla I lost the 10 pounds I gained in just 2 weeks, and I wasn't eating any different.
9	148	I probably have gained 15 pounds since I started taking it but I'm also 3 years older and glad I don't look like a teenager anymore.
9	149	Generess was hell for the first month that I took it, I was hungry hungry, broke out, gained weight, I also threw up.
9	150	The first month or two my appetite shot up, and I gained a little weight.
9	151	Not sure if I gained any weight because I don't weigh myself often and I don't think I've seen a real change in my body.
9	152	Bust got slightly bigger, gained a little weight but I was very stressed out and ate trash, so not necessarily the medication.
9	153	I gained 14 pounds in 5 months with no diet change.
9	154	I am thinking about coming off to see if I lose the weight I gained and if I do I want a different pill.
9	155	I gained 5 pounds in 3 weeks by doing nothing differently.
9	156	I gained fat on my love handles and I have not been eating or exercising any differently.
9	157	Haven't gained any weight at all, my boobs haven't gotten any bigger which sucks (32A...yea, I know), I don't have nausea anymore.
9	158	I've gained no weight, my chest is a little fuller but I didn't have to buy new bras, and, best of all, most months I don't have a period but if I do it lasts for a day or two and I only need a light tampon.
9	159	I have not gained a pound.
9	160	I've gained 5 pounds.
9	161	I was feeling a little more thick lately, I asked my boyfriend and he said I had gained a little bit of weight.
9	162	I have gained 15 pounds in the last 23 days and have never felt more uncomfortable in my own skin.
9	163	I've had no nausea and I had some mood issues but that went away for me within the first three months, it took my body about three months to adapt to the pill completely so it takes a while but it works very well.
9	164	There's no way I can live with constant gas pains and nausea and throwing up.
9	165	As a lot of other have said I do experience some nausea right before I'm about to start my period and my breasts have always been rather tender.
9	166	No nausea, no vomiting, etc.
9	167	I noticed a little nausea at first.
9	168	No nausea with this.
9	169	Constant nausea from the time I woke up until I went to sleep.
9	170	I didn't get depressed or nausea like a lot of other reviews.
9	171	I don't want to stop taking it because I'm getting married in two months so I'm pushing through the horribleness of it and hoping the nausea goes away eventually.
9	172	Right after I had the Implanon removed I switched to Generess Fe, I have been taking the pill over 2 months now and haven't experienced any nausea or vomiting.
9	173	I get a little nausea from time to time but nothing major.
9	174	Lots of nausea and vomiting on the second night.
9	175	Maybe a little VERY slight and tolerable nausea here and there, mostly after waking up due to empty stomach.
9	176	I have noticed some nausea, but it's also flu season!
9	177	I had the most nausea the first month on the pill but after that it seemed to gradually decrease to the point where I hardly noticed it at all, if any at all.
9	178	I've been on Generess Fe for roughly 5 months and I'm still experiencing bad nausea.
9	179	For the first month or two, I found myself feeling nauseated quite often, but I suppose that was just my body getting used to it.
9	180	I did feel super nauseated and sad every few days, but its normal.
9	181	While I can say the cyst pain had gone away I have now noticed that I get extremely nauseous on this pill.
9	182	I went on this after being on Junel, which made me break out and get very nauseous.
9	183	I started taking the pill a little over a month ago and it still makes me feel so nauseous.
9	184	Generess is not so bad, I did get nauseous in the beginning, and when I had to double up when I missed a pill.
9	185	The first day I took it I got nauseous but that was it.
9	186	I no longer have the horrible mood swings or extreme pms / pmdd symptoms that I did without birth control and on the other brands.
9	187	Downside: mood swings and they're constantly raising the price.
9	188	This pill has also caused me to have ridiculous mood swings and be a cranky, moody, slightly bitchy person.
9	189	I'll have my mood swings sometimes but I had those before being on bc.
9	190	My mood swings have been really bad also.
9	191	I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for about 2.5 years and never realized that that was what was giving me the craziest mood swings.
9	192	My mood swings are crazy.
9	193	The only side effects I had were mood swings and after the first 3 months I was able to control them.
9	194	Oh and I haven't any mood swings.
9	195	I actually LOST weight, my skin is back to being clear and my mood swings are very mild.
9	196	Other pills made me extremely moody, but this one hasnt given me mood swings at all.
9	197	I also experienced crazy mood swings and depression.
9	198	No weight, skin, or mood changes.
9	199	I must admit after reading all the negative reviews, I was very nervous to start this pill.
9	200	I do have sex regularly and I hate that I'm still nervous every month because I don't see blood, but no pregnancies have occurred.
9	201	I was really down, anxious, short, and hungry.
9	202	I do feel anxious but I also have been recovering from generalized anxiety disorder, so it's a normal feeling for me.
9	203	I naturally have chronic anxiety, but this pill never contributed to it.
9	204	Further- my anxiety is OFF THE CHARTS, I have a history with depression but haven't actually experienced it like this in years- which adds to the constant fatigue.
9	205	This helped me get rid of stress, anxiety and depression.
9	206	Gained 10lbs, had anxiety, swollen breasts, and no real period.
9	207	I do feel breast tenderness but that's it.
9	208	The first few months I had breast tenderness but that went away.
9	209	I know that may sound fantastic, but I got a horrible yeast infection that would not go away no matter what I tried (prescription and non prescription).
9	210	This was my last hope, I have been on Loestrin fe, Microgestin, NuvaRing and every one of them gave me constant yeast infections.
10	1	Yeah the beginning sucks, you’re spotting, acne gets worse, moody.
10	2	I have recently broke out on face a bit but I'm hoping my body will soon adjust because I chose it to help with acne.
10	3	I provided a quick summary of my experience with the pill two weeks in below and wanted to give an update...So, the good news- my boobs are bigger and the acne around my chin area has subsided.
10	4	I used another generic brand Vestura for several months and noticed my adult acne improving greatly as an added benefit.
10	5	My hormonal acne has gotten incredibly worse since the switch with 2 - 5 pimples every month.
10	6	Your acne does get semi worse for the first couple months but at month 3, I can see that my skin is clearing up.
10	7	For acne purposes, my face used to be extremely broken out & this definitely helped.
10	8	I have terrible cystic acne because of it, even have acne on my legs!!!!
10	9	So I switched to the IUD & everything was going well until about 6 months in I started getting HORRIBLE acne, like I had never had before.
10	10	Long story short I got it out & I just recently switched over from IUD back to Gianvi (after a few month break in between my acne got a lot better).
10	11	Since getting back on Gianvi I have been having the horrible acne coming back.
10	12	I see my esthetician weekly & have since my IUD acne.
10	13	I did not gain any weight, and have seen a slight improvement in my skin overall ( I never really had/have acne though).
10	14	I started this birth control to clear up my acne, prescribed by my doctor.
10	15	My acne has gotten way worse and I have gained 10 pounds, with the same diet and exercise daily.
10	16	Got on gianvi because of my insurance but it's definitely cleared up my acne and my boobs have gotten bigger.
10	17	No mood swings, no weight gain, it's helped my acne, it controls my appetite, and my breasts have actually gotten bigger.
10	18	After about 3-4 packs it cleared up my acne (I'm on the inert pills of my 5th pack now), it has relieved my menstrual cramps, helped to regulate my hormones, and is very effective as a birth control.
10	19	It took about 3 months for the acne to go away also.
10	20	As for all my other acne the pill did clear it up could just be an individual case I do have sensitive skin and some discoloration.
10	21	After several pills in the past made me an acne covered, fat crazy maniac I swore off pills for 7 yrs.
10	22	No acne, no emotional issues, I actually seem calmer!
10	23	It has done nothing to help my acne, it has made me lazy, and my mood swings are out of control...I'll become a sobbing mess out of nowhere.
10	24	It did however help with my acne.
10	25	I had pretty bad acne before and Gianvi helped control it.
10	26	My acne cleared up at first, but recently it's only my acne medication, Benza-Clin, that clears up my face.
10	27	I also broke out like a teenager with cyst type acne along my jawline, which after 3 months is just about clearing up with leftover spot marks.
10	28	Many reviews mentioned increased acne, weight gain, mood swings and heavy periods.
10	29	I have no acne, I lost 5 pounds, my periods last only 3 days and are very light and I have had no problems with my mood.
10	30	I switched to Gianvi from Aviane in hopes of clearing up my acne.
10	31	This medication made me moody, depressed and I broke out in painful cystic acne which I had never experienced before.
10	32	No weight gain (may have even lost a few lbs), my skin looks the same (never had a problem with acne in the first place), and I can honestly say my mood swings are more stabilized the week before my period.
10	33	My acne has cleared up for the most part and I haven't gained any weight.
10	34	However I started getting severe acne, a problem I haven't had in years, after switching to Gianvi.
10	35	My acne has almost gone away and my cramps have lessened.
10	36	The only positive thing I can say is that I did not notice worsening of any weight or acne problems.
10	37	My acne is also back, which I really dislike.
10	38	I have been taking it for the past two months and so far everything is fine except the fact that I now have horrible acne.
10	39	I never really had acne problems before taking Gianvi.
10	40	Was dizzy, sick to my stomach, constantly tired, started breaking out all over!
10	41	I am not breaking out any different from the past.
10	42	I used to have an intense 7 day period, extreme cramps, migraines, large pimples, and crazy mood swings for no apparent reason.
10	43	I had terrible cramps before, and this actually helped alot.
10	44	My breasts are almost unbearably sore, and it has done nothing for my horrible heavy period and painful cramps.
10	45	I lost weight (about 10lbs) even though I was eating the a lot of fast food and crap, my mood improved, I felt more motivated, and dispite having some spotting a couple of days before starting my period it did make my periods lighter and shorter with virtually no cramps.
10	46	I do still get cramps and mood swings, but both are very muted.
10	47	Gianvi gave me lighter and shorter periods, clear face, no cramps, no weight gain and no spotting.
10	48	I have no more cramps, no more cysts, my skin is clear except for a random zit, and even having depression and anxiety I have no psychological symptoms even without anti-depressants.
10	49	Hardly any cramps, no bloating and much lighter flow.
10	50	I'm a happy camper when there's no cramps.
10	51	No cramps, light flow.
10	52	I got my first headache and have little cramps in my lower abdomen.
10	53	My third month, unfortunately I started experiencing leg cramps which made me have to switch.
10	54	Little cramps, no bloating, no mood swings, light flow, AMAZING!
10	55	I also had headaches, high blood pressure and stomach cramps.
10	56	I started bleeding heavily and the cramping was relentless and unbearable.
10	57	brkout), short periods, & little cramping.
10	58	Way less cramping, no side effects, and it only lasts around 4 days.
10	59	I have no bloating when my period starts, my period is perfectly on schedule, less cramping and bleeding than before, no more migraines, and no mood swings.
10	60	Light periods, minimal cramping.
10	61	My period this month was only 2-3 days and it was spotting and I know I'm not pregnant because im not sexually active.
10	62	This pill is sensitive with regards to breakthrough bleeding, if just one pill is missed you can expect spotting the next day.
10	63	Last month I did get random spotting before my period, then my period started and stopped for a day then came back very light.
10	64	Periods were like clock work - 2 days sometimes only lasted even 1 but last year I started getting random spotting.
10	65	I told my doc I wanted to try something new as there are so many options and the random spotting wasn't making my husband happy.
10	66	I've been on Gianvi and its counterpart Loryna for almost 5 years now and the closest thing to a side effect that I have had is sometimes I will have some spotting on the 3rd Saturday of my pack (day 24).
10	67	I hardly even have a period; just some slight spotting when I take the placebo pills.
10	68	I've been on the pill for about 4-5 months and the main issue I have is for all of this month I have been spotting.
10	69	Also I spot every day and it yes so annoying because I want to wear my "nice underwear" but can't and I really don't want to wear a pad all the time.
10	70	Other pills used to make me spot inbetween periods.
10	71	After about two missed pills you receive your period, and during the inert pills you actually get a period & don't just spot.
10	72	I heard people tend to spot while on this pill and I am hoping it is just my body getting used to this pill.
10	73	Now I'm feeling nauseous, my breasts are swollen and painful and I've had a headache every other day for a month.
10	74	I thought it was giving me bad headaches, but in reality it’s mostly from dehydration.
10	75	And I have headaches all of the time.
10	76	My local pharmacy recently switched to a different brand (same hormone combo) of this birth control and I felt horrible, headaches, mood swings, stomach aches.
10	77	CONS: Constant bleeding, gained weight, horrible headaches, and mood swings that make me feel crazy.
10	78	I had headaches for a few months but my body got pretty used to it.
10	79	When I first took Gianvi, I experienced nausea, headaches, and dizziness.
10	80	The headaches I was getting on my previous birth control are completely gone, and I get my period for 2 days and its extremely light, compared to my 2 week long extremely heavy period.
10	81	On my previous birth control I gained some weight, my breasts got huge, and I got terrible headaches, but none of that with Gianvi.
10	82	It also made me feel super depressed all the time with headaches almost every other day.
10	83	Side effects I experienced the first week or so were headaches, breast tenderness & very tired.
10	84	Since switching to Gianvi, I get severe headaches that lasts 1-2 days a week before my period starts, which force me to sleep in bed all day.
10	85	I was on it for 2 months total, I got depressed on it, irritable, moody, cried for no reason, and got a migraine that lasted for days, it was unbearable.
10	86	I got lumps in my breast had horrible migraines and also experienced multiple hot flashes throughout the day.
10	87	I'm currently on Gianvi & let me tell ya I'm having the worst experience ever, my migraines are so bad after they're it feels like my brain is about to fall out of my head, I'm constantly dizzy & always having weird chest pain..
10	88	However I have never been such an emotional type until I started taking this pill, and As time went on I have noticed I get a lot of migraines and often dizziness and I am almost certain it is because of this pill, it's bitter sweet but I will be switching to another brand to see if anything changes.
10	89	I have much smaller breakouts and the migraines are gone.
10	90	For several months it reduced my migraines and I felt no mood changes.
10	91	CON: Over time, my migraines got horrible and more frequent, breasts increased a cup size, felt in a constant 'brain fog', had constant breakthrough bleeding that started triggering bacterial vaginosis infections and got vaginal dryness.
10	92	The doctor put me on it because of migraines I get from the pill but also because I have endometriosis.
10	93	I am not experiencing as many mood swings or migraines like some of the other people but I am noticing a slight change in my willingness to do things.
10	94	I started having horrible migraines, it gets to the point that I feel like if I open my eyes my head will explode.
10	95	I do still have some breast sensitivity, light bloating, and as of recently, a lower sex drive, but I'm not the raging, depressed, lethargic mess I was a month ago lol.
10	96	I had terrible mood swings, deep depressing feelings over trivial situations, uncontrollable crying and a total loss of sex drive.
10	97	No loss of sex drive for me, but it has not helped my period cramps/aches at all.
10	98	I also noticed this pill gave me zero sex drive--so maybe it is really effective birth control.
10	99	My sex drive was really low the first month, but it got back to normal.
10	100	Also, my sex drive has completely plummeted, I mean from 10 to absolutely ZERO.
10	101	Loss of sex drive in the first month but after that it went back to normal.
10	102	I have taken Gianvi for about four years now, started it for birth control reason, it cleared my face within months, I didn't feel any anxiety or anything that has to do with my mood, my sex drive has been the same with or without.
10	103	I've also noticed a slight weight gain and I'm moody as hell not to mention my sex drive is gone.
10	104	My sex drive has increased and no changes in my complexion yet.
10	105	My sex drive is virtually non-existent and my skin isn't nearly as clear as it was on Yaz.
10	106	My skin is clear, I have a sex drive, I didn't gain weight, and my periods are lighter.
10	107	My sex drive wasn't affected, I haven't had a zit in years, and my periods are light and regular.
10	108	My sex drive is the same.
10	109	My mood swings are up and down, my sex drive is gone.
10	110	I will say, however, that the most surprising side effect was an increased sex drive, as I had assumed that my libido would take a dive after starting birth control in general.
10	111	My once raging sex drive is now hardly existent.
10	112	My sex drive has severely gone down though, and I cry at the drop of a dime.
10	113	The only reason I would rate this a 5 is because it has prevented pregnancy, but since I started Gianvi 6 months ago I have been depressed, irritable, angry, unmotivated, and absolutely NO SEX DRIVE.
10	114	And no sex drive to speak of.
10	115	My libido has not changed, and my weight is not affected.
10	116	It also really cleared my face up I get almost no breakouts and also didn’t experience weight gain but everyone is different.
10	117	No matter how hard I worked out and watched my diet, I could not shed the 10-15 lb weight gain.
10	118	I had no mood changes or anxiety, nor weight gain.
10	119	Since going on Gianvi, I've seen considerable weight gain (some attributable to lifetime changes) but I now experience uncontrollable bouts of anger that near the level of rage.
10	120	I did notice a larger growth in my breasts (nice) with an overall weight gain in 3 months of about 6 lbs (not so nice).
10	121	No mood swings, no weight gain, however my chest size did increase a little.
10	122	So far I don't think I've gained any weight which is a bummer bc I'm underweight and really was looking forward to it.
10	123	Bad news, I've gained weight and I'm always bloated.
10	124	I don't think I've gained much weight, but my boobs have definitely gotten bigger.
10	125	I have gained about 30 pounds since being on it (with the same diet).
10	126	However, I gained about 10-15 pounds with the year I was on it (my boobs grew so that was a plus) & I started going into a depression & feeling like I was going insane.
10	127	My periods are regular however, I never bloated or gained weight.
10	128	Breasts got bigger but gained no weight in the stomach/thigh area.
10	129	However, my breasts got a lot bigger over the 4 years (great for my boyfriend, not so much for me) and I have gained weight.
10	130	What I did not love is that I am so hungry all the time on this pill, and although I haven't gone too overboard with eating, I've gained 10 pounds since starting the pill.
10	131	I gained 20lbs and it's awful.
10	132	Once I got off Gianvi, I lost most of the weight I gained.
10	133	While taking Gianvi gained 6 pounds.
10	134	I'm never happy but haven't gained weight and haven't gotten pregnant but that's the only positive thing.
10	135	I have since gained 18 lbs in that short amount of time.
10	136	I've been on that for a month and had such horrible nausea constantly and was sick to the point of throwing up on several occasions and even threw my pill up once and had to take plan b!
10	137	I had nausea in the morning- I have never had that before and now dread what morning sickness must feel like.
10	138	I did experience severe nausea twice, once in the first month and again in the second---But other than that, no significant changes in my skin, weight, menstrual cycle, etc.
10	139	The first three months I felt fine, once in a blue moon I would experience nausea.
10	140	In my third month of taking Gianvi I have had major mood swings, depression, anxiety, and changes in appetite varying from nausea to over eating.
10	141	I'm in and out of sleep and feel nauseous in the mornings.
10	142	For the first month, I felt really nauseous, almost like morning sickness.
10	143	I'm was a pretty mellow person before that I got the occasional mood swing that gave me whip lash and frequent hot flashes (which don't happen to a lot of people).
10	144	I've been using gianvi for over a month now and I haven't experienced any mood swings!!!
10	145	I always had terrible side effects including bloating, mood swings, and dryness.
10	146	Stopped taking it because it gave me mood swings, and caused me to break out more (which was the reason I wanted to take it in the first place).
10	147	I had terrible mood swings, felt terrible for those days taking it, afterwards I went back to Gianvi and things got back to normal.
10	148	My periods were back to normal, no more mood swings and my appetite was back to normal.
10	149	And the worst part was my mood swings.
10	150	NO MOOD SWINGS or hot flashes.
10	151	I had been on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo in the past and that made me gain approximately 10-15 lbs and made me have crazy mood swings, so I'm really glad I tried Gianvi despite the reviews.
10	152	Other than that, I have incredible mood swings from happy to incredibly depressed.
10	153	My mood swings are horrible, I go from extra happy to sad in a second, I have no energy what so ever, I used to not be able to sit in one place for 10 minutes now I can't drag myself from the couch, I'm extra sleepy and tired, my appetite is off the chart.
10	154	I love this pill no mood changes at all.
10	155	I spent hours reading reviews and was a little nervous to start taking these pills but they have been great.
10	156	When first taking this medicine, I was a bit nervous after having read so many negative reviews.
10	157	I first want to say that I read a bunch of reviews before starting Gianvi and became extremely nervous because of all the negatively.
10	158	I'm much less stressed and don't feel as anxious.
10	159	At first I didn't notice any difference, but slowly I have been getting more and more emotional, and anxious....something that I have never had a problem with before.
10	160	While my anxiety is still bad on the pill, a lot of it is probably natural.
10	161	After a night out, I came home and was overwhelmed with depression and anxiety.
10	162	I'm constantly feel like I'm having a anxiety attack my hormones are out of this world.
10	163	One thing that I have noticed is my anxiety and moodiness (depression) is completely out of control.
10	164	I'm either suffering from sky-high anxiety for no reason, or I'm fighting back tears for no reason!
10	165	I had terrible anxiety and trouble concentrating.
10	166	I then googled Gianvi and discovered that this level of depression and anxiety isn't uncommon on this pill.
10	167	I was on Apri a couple years ago which gave me very bad anxiety so after that I switched to Tri-Sprintec.
10	168	This pill didn't cause any anxiety but my skin broke out so terribly on it!
10	169	I have AWFUL anxiety and depression about almost everything.
10	170	I have also had a lot of changes to my appetite but have ended up losing 15 pounds because of my anxiety.
10	171	I have experienced bloating and tender breasts.
10	172	I began having yeast infection symptoms on a monthly basis to having full reoccurring yeast infections monthly.
10	173	I also developed a yeast infection while on it.
10	174	6 months of yeast infections!
10	175	I did notice that I got yeast infections and an increase pH level within days after I had sex (which I never had on Yaz or Yasmin).
11	1	I am currently 24, I started birth control when I first started my period at 12 because of how bad my pms would get and because of acne.
11	2	My pms was mild to none, acne was gone besides a few manageable breakouts, and I just felt amazing and had so much energy and I got into the best shape of my life.
11	3	I used another generic in place of Glidess in the past when my pharmacy ran out of it and I had terrible acne and felt sick while taking it so I'm afraid to take another generic version.
11	4	Plus it gave me horrible acne, and I've never struggled with acne.
11	5	Made me lose 5lbs/mo without changing anything in my life style, i never got pregnant and I never had acne.
11	6	I have never suffered from acne but after 3 months of taking this birth control I started breaking out with cystic acne,pimples and white heads.
11	7	But what I will HAVE to remember for the rest of my life is the cystic acne it has given me since stopping this pill.
11	8	Cystic acne is the worst, most hard to treat acne that is underneath the skin.
11	9	I am single, and am only taking this mainly for my acne issues.
11	10	I wasn't get cystic acne previously but did get one a couple days ago.
11	11	Also, just like other reviewers have noted, i have cystic acne on my forehead and even some on my back.
11	12	No acne.
11	13	I'm in my teens struggling with very oily acne prone skin since I was 10 so I was given this birth control as a last resort to clear my skin before my junior year.
11	14	It cleared up cheek acne but caused painful breakouts along the jaw line and mouth.
11	15	I did numerous things before to combat acne such as change my diet to plant based (vegan), use topical treatments, and drink the amount of water I needed daily so I assumed it was my hormones.
11	16	My message to everyone is that if you're going on this just for acne it's not worth it.
11	17	I'm on a higher dose of my antidepressant to counter act the mood swings but it sure isn't helping the weight gain or acne.
11	18	For me, the weight gain and acne isn't worth it.
11	19	My acne is all over the place but that isnt surprising because my face always broke out even before the bc.
11	20	I got big cystic acne on my chin and my forehead regularly- I never had acne as a teenager at all!
11	21	No signs of acne or weight gain however I did start getting really bad migraines before my period and during my period.
11	22	I get terrible cramps, mood swings, tender breasts, and acne when I'm not on BC or on any other BC.
11	23	My acne went away and I did not experience any cramps.
11	24	I also developed cystic acne every time my period came around.
11	25	The pill slightly helped my acne, but did not prevent new acne from coming.
11	26	My acne was also increasingly horrible for about a week.
11	27	However, now my mood has stabilized (except I'm still susceptible to depression easily) as well as my acne.
11	28	It also has given me very bad acne.
11	29	before starting this birth control I had no acne and relatively heavy periods with no cramps and slight bloating.
11	30	since starting this pill I have developed acne and severe mood swings and gained about 10 pounds.
11	31	I immediately developed acne all over my face, gained 20 pounds over the course of 2 months, suffered from debilitating cramps, and experienced intense mood swings.
11	32	I also didn't have a problem with acne until I started this pill.
11	33	I noticed I was gaining weight very fast and was breaking out with acne on my back.
11	34	I also went on it for my acne but it did nothing.
11	35	I used to struggle with acne and was worried it might make me break out, but if anything it made my skin clearer.
11	36	I get break outs every now and then like I always have so Gildess hasn't helped or made my acne worse.
11	37	My acne is usually controlled but not on this !
11	38	I don't gain any weight while on it and it clears up my acne.
11	39	My acne has cleared up, and I have not gotten pregnant, or gained much weight.
11	40	Not to mention mood swings, low libido, and tons of acne.
11	41	It was effective in preventing pregnancy, did not worsen nor produce acne, and I did not experience any remarkable weight gain.
11	42	The pill DID cause nausea (mostly during the first month), swollen & sore breasts (mostly during the 3rd month), and a bit of acne.
11	43	Before starting on Glidess, I had no mood swings, no acne, and no spotting - even when switched to generic Genress.
11	44	I also began to break out in acne -a problem that I had not had for about 4 years.
11	45	My period has been light, although my acne spikes a little mid-cycle.
11	46	I haven't experienced acne breakouts from it, which is a bonus.
11	47	This pill has not helped my acne at all however.
11	48	My boobs have grown which is another pro, but my acne has actually gotten worse.
11	49	If my acne doesn't clear up by the third month I think I'm going to switch because I really want clear skin...
11	50	My cramps are so bad and my acne is  ridiculous  I've never broken out this bad before.
11	51	Pretty sure I'm anemic at this point.Oh and my acne is atrocious.
11	52	Oh and my acne has cleared up.
11	53	I gained 20 pounds, extreme drowsy-ness, always tired, a lot of spotty and terrible acne which I've never had before.
11	54	Also my acne cleared up really fast and now I have none!
11	55	Had breakthrough bleeding first three or four months and acne.
11	56	Went to the dermatologist about the acne and she said the birth control is a good brand and it would help with acne over the next few months.
11	57	Initially I started this pill to help with my heavy and irregular periods and my acne.
11	58	I've had moderate-severe acne since I was 7 and I was desperate for a change.
11	59	Little did I know that the type of progestin in this pill is not known to help acne.
11	60	This cleared my acne and prevented pregnancy, but it had way more negative effects than positive.
11	61	I had acne.
11	62	I also bought proactive and it didn't help me form breaking out I have been off this bc for two days .
11	63	I used to not have any and now I get cystic pimples on the regular.
11	64	Second month I started getting nauseous every day, bad cramps, but only got my period for an hour.
11	65	Debilitating cramps, severe nausea and overall feel like death.
11	66	For 11 years my cycles were always 26-28 days, the reason I went back on the pill was due to painful menstrual cramps and not to get pregnant.
11	67	I rather have two painful days of menstrual cramps.
11	68	The first and second month and a half, I was experiencing bloating, nausea and pelvic cramps.
11	69	Now, I'm on my third week of my fourth pack and I've been experiencing pelvic cramps for a week.
11	70	No cramps!
11	71	Not to mention I have really bad cramps with this break through bleeding.
11	72	I have lower back cramps from time to time too.
11	73	Before the birth control I had lower back cramps whenever I had my period and it'll last for 7 days.
11	74	I've been experiencing bloating and pelvic cramps here and there.
11	75	While on the nexplanon I never had cramps, bloating, breast tenderness, or horrible mood swings.
11	76	I haven't had any cramps to date, but cramps were never bad before the pill anyways.
11	77	I am sooooo happy I finally found something that takes away those terrible debilatating cramps!!!!
11	78	When the seventh month came around I had my period for two weeks straight followed by extremely painful cramps.
11	79	The cramps would return every period for 2-3 days.
11	80	I also bleed almost constantly, about 3 weeks per month, very lightly and now experience cramps when on the placebo pill.
11	81	I also never typically have cramps, but boy did I have cramps.
11	82	Also gave me some cramps and Breast tenderness the first month
11	83	Today the cramps are still in my side (not painful just uncomfortable and concerning) and possible constipation.
11	84	I used to have the worst period, and now they are short and my cramps aren't as bad.
11	85	Anyway, I feel fine now, my periods are regular and I don't have terrible cramps.
11	86	I get extremely bad cramps and bloating aswell.
11	87	After starting this my cramps became intense, my periods became so heavy and my libido decreased significantly but I haven't gotten pregnant while using it.
11	88	During the first month I had cramps (usually very mild) every day, then a normal period 2 weeks into the pack, followed by spotting with mild cramps until I finished that pack.
11	89	With headaches.. No weight gain or decreased libido.. Just terrible cramps and tons of spotting and mood swings and depression.
11	90	I also have horrible cramps now and I never use to have them.
11	91	I got horrible cramps when I got my first period on it and my period was really irregular but I figured I just needed to adjust.
11	92	This BC didn't do much for my cramps.
11	93	My period lasted for a whole week last time and although it wasn't heavy I still had cramps.
11	94	I had mild side effects- increase appetite, some cramps and mild nausea.
11	95	I been taking this birth control for 2 months and I hate it, I am bleeding all the time, it's not helping with my periods and I get cramps so bad it hurts to move sometimes.
11	96	I've been on birth control since I was 16 to help with my cramps and PMS.
11	97	No cramps, light to none preriod.
11	98	This pill did tremendously help with my cramps and lighten my period.
11	99	I'll just deal with the cramps, not worth it
11	100	It helped with cramps, but after being rushed to the ER for possible DVT, I decided to stop.
11	101	I always feel groggy, lethargic, and have constant cramps.
11	102	However, this pill did regulate and lighten my periods but not without terrible, terrible cramps.
11	103	I've been on this pill for 9months now, my cramps are still present but not nearly as bad.
11	104	Until about 2 months ago, I started to spot in between periods and I get really bad cramps if I don't take my pill on time or if I skip a day, I don't know if it's because of that reason but let me tell ya this pain is killing me.
11	105	No more cramps, heavy bleeding and bad dizzy hormone spells.
11	106	My first period lasted for about three weeks with the worst cramps I have ever had in my life, I had constant headaches, absolutely NO sex drive, always felt exhausted, and I was irritated at little things.
11	107	I experience no weight gain, no bloating, hardly any  cramps (which is the only reason I even got on the pill) and my period was super light
11	108	My period comes the same time every month and no more cramps!
11	109	I had terrible cramps the whole first day I started, no matter what I did.
11	110	This is my first time on the pill to help with cramps and this birth control is helping a lot.
11	111	I no longer have raging cramps every month.
11	112	I no longer have any sort of spotting, the cramps still come every now and then, but my period is always right on time.
11	113	So far no cramps, no weight gain, my sex drive still the same and I'm not moody.
11	114	I'm more moody also and have worse cramps than before.
11	115	Not to mention I get all the lousy pre-period symptoms such as back aches and cramps, but no bleeding.
11	116	but I still have really bad cramps & I started my period again but just spotting .
11	117	I've probably had about one bad cramp, unlike when I wasn't on birth control I would have terrible cramps every month.
11	118	I'm hoping that this will not make me gain weight, break out, or cramp like a lot of the reviews have stated.
11	119	I no longer cramp like used too.
11	120	No more periods, no headaches or cramping.
11	121	First month I had tender breasts, which never happened before, cramping, and my period lasted over a week.
11	122	Very light period, barely any cramping, and barely any symptoms.
11	123	I have constant cramping, I became depressed, I've gained 15-20 pounds, had numerous anxiety attacks and plagued with paranoia, had the worst breakouts of my life, ohh and the whole reason I'm taking birth control, you know to treat my ovarian cysts, guess who just got discharged from the hospital with prescribed pain medicine because of their frickin ovarian cysts???
11	124	I missed taking a pill by 2 hours and I had already began breakthrough bleeding and severe cramping.
11	125	That stopped two days ago and yesterday I started feeling weird cramping in my left side just below my ribs and it went into the tops on my thighs and hips.
11	126	I'm on the first month of this pill and have had NO bleeding but all the cramping and gas.
11	127	Within the first couple of days taking it I was instantly bloated and my breasts were swollen, at about the 1 week mark I started having cramping like I was about to start my period and sure enough I did start my period mid cycle.
11	128	I don't bleed at all, however I missed one night and by morning I had severe cramping, which also comes w/my treatment so it may not have only been caused by the BC.
11	129	I did wake up with a little cramping this morning and I had a little spot of blood in my undies but I'm fine now.
11	130	And when I start spotting heavily, I get severe cramping.
11	131	I knew exactly when it would come but now on my 3rd row of the pack I am spotting?
11	132	I started the first day of my period and I've been spotting where as I actually need to wear a tampon basically ever since.
11	133	Now I've been spotting for about 8 days.
11	134	I starting spotting which just turned into my period that lasted like normal and wasn't too heavy.
11	135	The next month I started spotting in between my periods for the first time.
11	136	As the months have gone on, I've experience heavier spotting in between my scheduled periods and lighter periods because of that.
11	137	I am currently on day 10 of my weird spotting when I should be having my period (on day 1 of placebo pill).
11	138	It has really helped with the mood swings, but this nasty spotting all the time isn't any good.
11	139	Other than that I don't have any other side effects at all it's pretty great it regulated my period and I have no random spotting or pain of any kind so I don't recoment it as the best form of BC but it's not the worst one and works very well for preventing pregnancy.
11	140	It does take at least 3 months for your body to get used to it and you have to take it at the exact time to prevent spotting and/or breakthrough bleeding.
11	141	But then in December I started getting spotting and a period almost every other week.
11	142	After my first six months, however, I experienced spotting, heavier bleeding, and random periods throughout the month.
11	143	Then today, I had random spotting even though I've been on the pill for 4 months and am extremely moody (something that was never a problem when on the other pill).
11	144	Only have a 2 day period, sometimes some spotting the week prior.
11	145	Only once or twice in the whole year have I had slight spotting in between placebo pills.
11	146	Not to mention everyday spotting!
11	147	But this time when I tried it I was spotting, I got weird feelings in my head, I had back pains, flu-like symptoms, chest pain and terrible anxiety.
11	148	It's been about 3 weeks now and not just spotting either...
11	149	I'm not just talking  spotting.
11	150	I get one every few months and it's still just spotting, which can get scary.
11	151	Let me say since starting this birth control  I haven't had a period for 6 years, a little spotting here or there but nothing I was concerned about.
11	152	I've been on this pill for over a year, I've never had any problems with it in the beginning except a little spotting in between periods and headaches at first.
11	153	The pain usually happens when I'm spotting.
11	154	I didn't experience any low sex drive, spotting or mood changes.
11	155	It made my vagina weirdly dry, mood swings were present before but were somehow amplified, and I bleed even when I'm not on my period (not just spotting, like a solid week before my period week).
11	156	The only thing that bothers me is pretty much having another period mid cycle, wasn't really light spotting either.
11	157	My last period lasted for 13 days and I am still spotting here and there.
11	158	It's gentle, it's not conflicting with my lifestyle and I have my period regularly without any spotting.
11	159	It made me have spotting constantly, so I had to go off it pretty quickly.
11	160	I'm on my 4th day of the inactive pills and my period still isn't here, but I spot all through the month.
11	161	Only bad thing is that I spot a little after sex or after a bowel movement.
11	162	I will spot a little once a month.
11	163	I spot in the middle of my cycle about a week before my before starts and i thought this was just my body getting use to it, but it's become clockwork.
11	164	My period is always on time, I hardly ever spot between them an I am overall very pleased!
11	165	I spotted in the third week of the pack and got my period on the placebo week.
11	166	In my third pack, I spotted and only had my period for about 3 days when I normally have it for 5.
11	167	I haven't spotted yet .
11	168	Within the last month, I spotted for about 2 days.
11	169	I have spotted for about 10 days, and my breasts are a little sore maybe swollen.
11	170	I shouldn't start until @ sat still on last week of pills, I spotted Monday in morning, it stopped.
11	171	I have spotted everyday taking this pill last two months and have pink discharge after sex.
11	172	I always have a headache on Gildess.
11	173	I have also suffered from migraines and headaches daily in the 3rd month.
11	174	I have been dizzy, had headaches and nausea since day 3.
11	175	I have experienced horrible nausea, headaches, mood swings and depression.
11	176	I have breast and nipple tenderness which hurts bad I have headaches more then usual.
11	177	I had my implanon removed after a year and a half of nonstop bleeding and suffering from severe vertigo and headaches, and depression.
11	178	Panic attacks, headaches, suicidal thoughts.
11	179	I've also been experiencing a lot of headaches and body/joint pain over the last couple weeks.
11	180	The only thing that really changed my body was that in the first couple of months my breast were tender & I had headaches almost everyday!
11	181	When I get a migraine I know my period is on its way.
11	182	I still continue to break out all the time, randomly have nausea, especially in the mornings, & being out in the heat makes me nauseous and  gives me migraines (not sure if that's from the medicine, but started about the time I started taking it).
11	183	I had a Mirena IUD for 3 years, and I had it removed because I had low sex drive, pain from ovarian cysts, and I was getting frequent migraines.
11	184	Then the migraines started.
11	185	I had minor migraines in my forehead that got worse with light or after waking up.
11	186	I've been on this pill for a little over 4 months now, ever since I started it I have not gotten my period at all, get migraines frequently but no mood swings.
11	187	The first couple of days I noticed no symptoms and was so happy.. out of no where i started waking up with migraines and breaking out..
11	188	I switched to this after having problems with depo, which caused me horrible migraines that actually put me in the hospital.
11	189	I rather gain a ton of weight on the depo, and deal with migraines again, than deal with what I'm going through on gildess.
11	190	I do get very emotional once a month though, worse than I ever have before, and during that time I'm not really hungry and have constant migraines.
11	191	I had to switch because I have an estrogen intolerance so I was getting severe migraines with regular pills.
11	192	The benefits of not having migraines and overall lighter periods do NOT outweigh the negatives of this pill.
11	193	After about 2 weeks, my migraines started to increase in frequency and severity.
11	194	I feel depressed and have no sex drive.
11	195	When I was on this in 2015, I was very depressed and no sex drive but I was also in a bad relationship so I wont put the blame on the pill just yet.
11	196	I had very low sex drive.
11	197	On Minastrin I lost 45 pounds, clear skin like never before, good sex drive, not an emotional hurricane, and never got car sick.
11	198	In 7 months alone on gildess I gained 25 pounds and counting(even with a healthy lifestyle), suffering depression and anxiety, NO sex drive, periods are HORRID, face has exploded more than going through puberty and I am 21, and taking this makes me sick.
11	199	I have great skin, am at my goal weight after months of losing weight, I'm always a happy person, have a high sex drive, and have very regular periods.
11	200	I am so glad that I did not read user reviews before switching as I probably would have never tried it....Since switching to Gildess BC, I no longer have break through bleeding,  my sex drive is improved, no break outs have occurred (which was a big concern) but the best part is that I've lost the bloated abdomen!
11	201	Anxiety got better then got worse, and now I have pretty much no sex drive and I'm always angry.
11	202	I didn't have a problem with nausea, but I'm moody, angry, sleepy all the time, and have absolutely zero sex drive.
11	203	I also have absolutely no sex drive, which has caused some problems between the BF.
11	204	The only downside is I have little to no sex drive.
11	205	So far I'm a month in on Gildess and overall it's been a positive experience, my period was right on time and 4 days shorter than it used to be, less breakthrough bleeding than on ortho, and my sex drive, which had taken a dive in recent years, seems to be returning.
11	206	I have lost weight and my sex drive is high.
11	207	but after only two months of taking it, I have zero sex drive.
11	208	I'm incredibly moody, kind of depressed (weird highs and lows), almost no sex drive whatsoever and have gained about 10 pounds.
11	209	My sex drive still the same.
11	210	I have noticed a much lower sex drive, but it does its job so I'm not complaining.
11	211	I don't have mood swings, and my sex drive is still pretty high, and my skin looks amazing.
11	212	The only things I have noticed while taking it is occasionally a low sex drive, which is honestly not a problem unless you want to feel sexy 24/7, which, let's face it, is just not for everyone.
11	213	The pills stopped my period, caused mood swings, vaginal dryness and killed my sex drive.
11	214	I had been taking this medication for 1 year and I noticed decreased libido and fluttering veins which made me stop taking it.
11	215	Getting used to it was an emotional adventure but no major weight gain and my libido has even increased!
11	216	I hated this birth control due to the lack of libido, vaginal dryness (during sex), and PERSISTENT YEAST INFECTIONS.
11	217	It wasn't until October-December 2017 that I took a break from the pill for some blood work that I realized that it was this pill that was either causing or exasperating anxiety, depression, irritability, moodiness and weight gain.
11	218	The weight gain is an issue as well, I gained 12 pounds within the 1st month.
11	219	It's a good thing my husband and I don't want a baby because with the weight gain, break outs and no sex drive-it won't happen while taking this trash pill.
11	220	I tried everything for the weight gain figuring it might have been eating habits and the fact that I'm in my 20s now and my body is changing but nothing helped!!
11	221	Some irregular bleeding here and there, but only 3 pound weight gain.
11	222	I was terrified it would affect my moods, weight gain, etc.
11	223	I didn't have any side effects such as moodiness or weight gain, that I seemed to notice.
11	224	I just watched what I ate, and no weight gain at all!
11	225	I did notice a slight weight gain but Overall, I'm pleased with the birth control.
11	226	Some weight gain and light or nonexistent periods.
11	227	I didn't notice any weight gain, but did experience occasional mood swings.
11	228	I was on Depo shot for 6 years, no periods, no weight gain, all great.
11	229	I thought this birth control was great at first, but I have now gained 40+ pounds after being on this.
11	230	I have gained wieght, feel depressed and tired and when I do have periods now they are horrible, painful,and really heavy.
11	231	Therefore, I gained about 7-8 pounds.The next six months were great and I had no issues.
11	232	I gained about 6 pounds in the first week.
11	233	I gained about 20 pounds in the past 2 years and have finally had enough and made my gyno switch me to something else (she also insisted it was my eating habits and not the pill numerous times which is why I stayed on it for so long) my friend was also on the same pill for years and gained even more than I did.
11	234	I gained 4 pounds and now I have stubborn belly fat.
11	235	Also my breasts went up a size and haven't gained weight anywhere else so far.
11	236	I get break outs on my chest (ew gross, I know) and I have gained so much weight on it.
11	237	First off, I haven't gained any weight and I'm not pregnant which is good.
11	238	I've gained about 5 pounds, which isn't too bad for switching birth control.
11	239	Very depressed all the time,  extreme highs and way more extreme lows, my skin has never broken out like it has since starting this pill, I've gained almost 40 pounds no matter how I cut back and exercise more I can't get rid of it (something I've never had a problem with), my hair is literally falling out,  I'm so achy and sore all day everyday, and I don't even know what sleep is anymore.
11	240	I switched from Emoquette after a year because I gained 20 pounds, which is horrible.
11	241	I've gained 20 pounds, I feel like the cravings are out of control.
11	242	I've also gained alot of weight.
11	243	I recently gained weight but not due to the birth control.
11	244	I haven't gained any weight on the pill either.
11	245	Gained 15+ lbs in 3 months - not even sure how much weight I gained due to the constant water weight and bloating I've had.
11	246	I gained about 20 pounds in 3 months.
11	247	I gained some weight.
11	248	But after 3 months I've gained ten pounds and have been very angry lately.
11	249	Only negative side affect I think is slight unusual nausea but coming from awful endometriosis, it seriously doesn't even bug me.
11	250	At first I did have mood swings (pretty bad), I was emotional, with nausea but not too bad.
11	251	The first month, I had really bad nausea, car sickness & breakouts.
11	252	The first month included some nausea, but everything else seemed fine.
11	253	I also am experiencing some bloating and nausea.
11	254	The symptoms only effect my mood so far no nausea.
11	255	I think I experienced a little bit of nausea and fatigue the first month on it and some breakthrough bleeding up until the third month, but all those side effects have subsided and my skin has been super clear as well!
11	256	I have stayed very nauseated and done nothing but cry.
11	257	3 days after I started I woke up horribly nauseated but no vomit so I sucked it up and went to work just to get there and throw up repeatedly for about two hours.
11	258	I was very nauseous the first two weeks when I would wake up in the morning.
11	259	I have felt nauseous every single day.
11	260	I was switched to Seasonique generic, Ashlyna, but it made me very nauseous and VERY hungry.
11	261	I was also slightly nauseous at times for the first week, but nothing unbearable or that would make me stop taking it.
11	262	I feel nauseous a lot.
11	263	I was also bloated and nauseous while taking it.
11	264	I get so dizzy and nauseous on this pill.
11	265	Also, when I'm on my period I get nauseous and I'm not sure if that's from the birth control or just me being on my period.
11	266	I also feel nauseous and very lethargic.
11	267	I felt constantly dizzy and nauseous for the first two months I was on this pill.
11	268	I was dizzy and nauseous, a lot.
11	269	And I feel dizzy all the time, and feel out of body.
11	270	Terrible - depression, mood swing, highs and lows, uncontrollable moods, went to emergency room for possible DVT turned out to be nothing...
11	271	Mood swing is only 1day before the period but I think I even ghad those before BC lol That's it :)
11	272	This definitely helped control my mood swings and I even lost some weight when switching.
11	273	During the first month I had severe mood swings with extreme bought of depression and rage.
11	274	For the first month it made me feel crazy because I was having mood swings but that got better.
11	275	I started taking this pill around 7 months ago to treat my extreme mood swings.
11	276	Then out of no where, MOOD SWINGS.
11	277	& when I say mood swings, I'm talking a full 180.
11	278	Hopefully no more mood swings!
11	279	The mood swings are bad enough and since there is no bleeding I was super paranoid I had somehow gotten pregnant so I took a test and it came up negative twice.
11	280	My mood swings have been insane and everyone pointed it out to me after I have been saying I feel depressed spent a lot of time sleeping and in my room.
11	281	Worst birth control ever chronic yeast infections, terrible mood swings.
11	282	I've had chronic yeast infections and dryness, mood swings to where I am no where near myself, and I am beginning to get random/extra periods while in the middle of my packet.
11	283	I had constipation/gas while I was on it along with some mood swings, although I can't be 100% sure that these things were actually caused/worsened by the pill.
11	284	I have also been experiencing extreme mood swings.
11	285	It took a few months for my mood swings to get better (I felt like I was going crazy for about 3 months) but for the last 9 months I feel great.
11	286	I've been taking this for about 4 months and I have never been an overly emotional person and now all the sudden my mood swings and emotions are off the charts.
11	287	My mood swings suck.
11	288	But I definitely still have mood swings pretty regularly.
11	289	My mood swings were so bad before I took the pill and now I feel so normal and in control.
11	290	I do get mood swings but I'm thinking it's because I am so tired of bleeding.
11	291	I couldn't control my mood swings and I would get really emotional here and there.
11	292	No major mood swings on this for me either.
11	293	It has the lowest dosage of artificial hormones, doesn't make me gain weight or have crazy mood swings.
11	294	Gave me emotional mood swings.
11	295	I had the worst mood swings.
11	296	I was nervous at first because everyone is so negative about it.
11	297	Was really nervous about the switch because I tried something different about 5 years in on the ortho and had a nasty emotional reaction to it.
11	298	I felt bloated all the time, I had insane breast tenderness, and I was incredibly irritable and anxious for absolutely no reason.
11	299	Ever since I started using it, I've been feeling very skeptical, anxious, and worried.
11	300	I realized that this birth control was making me feel crazy, anxious  and not myself so I made an app.t for my OBGYN for a better option.
11	301	I definitely don't recommend this pill if you already have anxiety.
11	302	It made my anxiety attacks much worse.
11	303	My anxiety and depression has been at an all time high,not to mention I am agitated about pretty much anything.
11	304	Stress I've always had and anxiety I've always had, I don't think it's linked to birth control in anyway.
11	305	Now I've had a good 4 months of non-stop anxiety, paranoia, and depression that wasn't there before.
11	306	I have had the breast tenderness throughout being on the pill but yesterday I actually started noticing milk out of one of my breasts so far.
11	307	I had a long period the first month, and my appetite increased, along with some breast tenderness.
11	308	I also had a yeast infection and a UTI 2 weeks later.
11	309	I could not have sex with a yeast infection so the pill became essentially useless.
11	310	I used the pill for six months and after six months with yeast infections I got off of it.
12	1	It cleared up the terrible acne I had during the teenage years of my life, regulated my almost completely unpredictable menstrual cycle, made the week of my period an easy and manageable experience due to lessened flow, and has made me feel much more secure when having intimate relations with my husband.
12	2	I also noticed that I gradually got less acne to the point where I only have 1 or 2 breakouts per month now (but I had acne before I even started the pill).
12	3	However, I haven't noticed any weight gain nor increase in acne.
12	4	No acne, no weight loss or gain... mood swings are unsure, mainly because I had a traumatic incident in July and then again just 2 weeks ago, along with having chronic illnesses.
12	5	Some pros for me: I never experienced weight gain on the pill or any acne issues.
12	6	I had always suffered from acne since I was a middle schooler and it made all my acne go away (except for when I was about to get my period).
12	7	No sign of weight gain nor acne changes either.
12	8	No more cramps, no acne (unless I was about to start), hadn't gotten pregnant.
12	9	Not once have I ever had any kind of serious acne and within a few days of taking the medication my skin is awful.
12	10	I was on accutane for a year and it cleared up all my acne.
12	11	Not only do I have the worst acne I have ever had in my ENTIRE life (I am 27 years old, mind you - I have been on birth control since I was 16) my last period was 10 days and I spot regularly.
12	12	I haven't gained weight, my acne has gotten way better than it was, I have been protected from pregnancy (I take this pill RELIGIOUSLY down to the minute every single day!)
12	13	This pill is effective in preventing pregnancy and helping with acne.
12	14	Taking for PCOS causing acne, late periods, and severe cramps.
12	15	I never had any mood swings or weight gain and it cleared up my acne.
12	16	Junel has made me feel so bloated and has made my acne get worse.
12	17	It didn't do much to clear up my acne.
12	18	I've had acne for about 5 yrs & I've tried everything but accutane, but to no avail.
12	19	I accepted that I was going to have to deal with acne.
12	20	Firstly, I started developing cystic acne on my chin, which never happened before.
12	21	I've most definitely gained weight and have seen my acne get worse.
12	22	I don't experience any mood swings, acne or weight gain.
12	23	I know that it takes a while for you body to adjust to the pill but I am on my second week of my menstrual cycle which is waaayyy to long for starters, I've gotten a bit more acne breakouts and I have noticed that, with my mood I have become more sensitive to things that usually don't bother me.
12	24	It did clear up the acne I had before I started using this bc.
12	25	Then, I started breaking out in cystic acne all over my chin and cheeks.
12	26	I had very light periods, no cramps, no acne, no weight gain, and I didn't get pregnant.
12	27	I went through my teens without getting one pimple and never struggled with acne UNTIL taking junel.
12	28	My chin was covered with painful, cystic acne.
12	29	Other than the moods I have little/no period, no acne, no weight gain, no cramps.
12	30	I haven't had acne this bad since I was 14..
12	31	Once I started taking this I broke out very badly, and started getting acne which I have never had a problem with.
12	32	I broke out all over with acne and i have only ever had 1 or 2 pimples in my life at the same time.
12	33	I did however notice I want to eat 24/7 (which I can control) and my mood swings are little more severe...sex drive and acne wasn't affected.
12	34	I never had acne maybe a pimple or two during my periods but this pill does not make me break out and gives me so much energy when you take it everyday at the same time.
12	35	As far as it working on acne, it has lessened it but it is not completely gone.
12	36	It cleared up my acne and I felt good.
12	37	I guess I didn't realize how much junel had been suppressing my appetite and even my teenage acne... And no, I'm not pregnant so the weight gain cannot be contributed to that.
12	38	less acne.
12	39	My period has lightened, my acne has cleared up, and I haven't gotten pregnant, so, I recommend this!
12	40	Skin is better, though I've never really had acne.
12	41	I do not have acne and I do not experience weight gain but it causes me to always start my period mid pill pack.
12	42	No weight gain or acne for me though
12	43	Unlike other birth control, my acne was regulated before my period come on but during that light flow, Hello acne.
12	44	Works well, a couple side effect to be aware of is acne, weight gain, and nausea
12	45	CONS: Mild increase in acne; slight spotting in the beginning; nausea; cramping.
12	46	It cleared up my acne that I struggled with for a long time and now I only get a few breakouts during my period.
12	47	What I'm concerned about currently is my acne.
12	48	The pill has been helping my acne so far, but over the past couple of weeks I've been having issues (acne along the jawline, although not as bad as when I'm off the pill).
12	49	No acne but I use Proactiv because I used to get bad breakouts.
12	50	I've never had acne and only gained a few pounds.
12	51	I've never had great skin, and I've noticed some increased acne since starting the pill, as well as some depression.
12	52	My face is having a lot more issues with acne so that sucks.
12	53	My moderate acne has completely cleared up thanks to this pill.
12	54	I have not had any additional problems with weight, acne, etc.
12	55	I used to have cramps, bad acne, mood swings and back pain.
12	56	My mood swings, cramps and acne went away!
12	57	I'm thinking about going off the pill now which is what brought me here, but I'm worried that it will make me gain weight and get acne again.
12	58	I'm moving through my second month of these pills after having tried Depo-Provera, which I hated, no sex drive, extremely mental... Seasonique, which cause teenage-like acne, wacky spotting...
12	59	It's beginning to clear up and I heard that it takes 1 or 2 packs for the acne to balance out.
12	60	No weight gain, no acne, no moodiness, I have a very light, scheduled period, and it does what it's supposed to - prevents pregnancy.
12	61	The pill has improved my acne and made me gain a little weight (which I don't mind because I'm on a weight gaining diet) but otherwise this isn't the medication for me.
12	62	The only pro was that it cleared my acne.
12	63	Dry flaky patch on my usually non acne face.
12	64	I have never had acne as an adult.
12	65	So, I'm on month two of my pack and my acne, which wasn't bad before I started taking the Pill, is out of control.
12	66	My acne did clear up.
12	67	Cleared up my acne, and regulated my hormones so I no longer have mood swings or PMS, and have never once been nauseated.
12	68	No acne or weight gain.
12	69	My face has cleared up and my back acne is also started to clear up.
12	70	I went on birth control for the first time in my life, I was experiencing bad acne and cramps almost 15 days before my period starts.
12	71	Since then my mild acne breakouts have cleared up, I haven't gained any weight, my periods are extremely light and tolerable, and I really have had no negative side effects.
12	72	Junel cleared up my acne but took away my sex drive.
12	73	My libido has increased and my acne cleared up.
12	74	I start this and I start breaking out.
12	75	My skin is insanely greasy, I'm breaking out like crazy, and to top it off, I've gained 15lbs because my appetite has been out of control!
12	76	I went on it because I wanted something with lower estrogen that still prevented pregnancy, but less hormones (mood swings, breaking out, nausea) was horrid.
12	77	I started Junel Fe in the summer of 2011 after being on Tri Lo Sprintec in 2010 and breaking out in severe hives the size of my fist.
12	78	The next few months, it felt like I wasn’t even on the pill, since my period cramps returned, my face broke out with more pimples, my appetite grew, and I was bloated all the time.
12	79	It made my face break out with lots of big pimples that looked like cysts that wouldn't go away.
12	80	I had crazy breakouts on my forehead the first year of taking it but my body has gotten used to the hormones so I'll only get a few zits right before my period.
12	81	Broke out with painful zits occasionally.
12	82	Some cramping here and there but nothing my heating pad can’t fix, and nothing out of the ordinary compared to my usual period cramps.
12	83	I've been consistently bleeding since starting the pill and experienced excruciating cramps during the first week.
12	84	I continued to bleed and have cramps throughout the entire pack, and I would frequently feel dizzy.
12	85	It made me angry, moody, cranky and emotional, I've had cramps everyday since I started taking it and now I'm spotting constantly -almost daily.
12	86	I went on this for my intense period cramps.
12	87	However the flow was heavy, I had severe cramps that made me feel nauseous and I was SUPER moody.
12	88	However, I barely felt any cramps and flow was light.
12	89	The spotting with cramps returned and when I contacted my doctor, she gave me the option to try it for one more month.
12	90	When I was prescribed this pill for my extremely painful cramps, I read the reviews for Junel and was terrified to start taking the pills, but I’m glad I stuck with it!
12	91	Not to mention the super bad cramps and the fact that I bled for probably 3 weeks straight during the month I was on it.
12	92	It has really helped with me cramps and mood swings.
12	93	Went on it to regulate my period and stop my horrible cramps.
12	94	My doctor recommended this brand for my extremely painful cramps I'd get at the beginning of every cycle, which would often lead me to throw up from the pain.
12	95	My period lasts about 4 days now (as opposed to 7 days) with very light bleeding and hardly any cramps.
12	96	It marginally alleviated my cramps.
12	97	I always know when the first day is coming, and the cramps and heavy bleeding only last one day, on the first day, when they lasted longer before the pill.
12	98	From the moment I started taking it I felt dizzy, had cramps, anxiety, mood swings, loss of energy and worse of all, I was getting migraines like almost every day.
12	99	I also had several days of mild cramping rather than my usual one day of more intense cramps--wasn't a fan.
12	100	It helped lighten my periods and eliminate cramps during my period.
12	101	However I do get cramps after taking the active pills occasionally.
12	102	My old pills helped with bloating, cramps, and flow and none of that changed when I started Junel fe.
12	103	My cramps are only bad the first day which is usually the second/third day that I take my placebo pills.
12	104	This birth control was a miracle for me because I used to have horrible period cramps, and it made them go away completely.
12	105	I never had cramps before and now I get my period in between cycles and my cramps hurt so badly.
12	106	Lighter periods and less cramps.
12	107	Junel Fe give me hardly any cramps which is amazing because mine used to be so bad I would vomit and I have light to no periods during brown pill week.
12	108	It controlled my symptoms (heavy flow, severe cramps), but NOT worth the side effects.
12	109	The pills have made my period a lot lighter and my cramps less severe.
12	110	It sent me to the hospital with Dysmenorrhea which is horrible cramps but my cramps felt like contractions.
12	111	This is the first time in my life that I've had a period without cramps.
12	112	The first few days were fine and I had very few problems As I got farther along into the pill pack I started having more side effects such as Bad cramps, light headed, I was very moody, My back was very achy, and I started to have headaches.
12	113	The first month I suffered from debilitating stomach cramps almost everyday for the first 3 weeks, sometimes causing me to have to leave work.
12	114	I got on the birth control to help lighten my cramps and flow, but I have yet to experience that.
12	115	I started taking Junel Fe due to sudden horrible menstral cramps that led me to pass out and hit my head on my bathroom tile.
12	116	Also calmed my cramps.
12	117	Before BC i would get cramps EVERY TIME my cycle started.
12	118	With this, I only had cramps occasionally.
12	119	But had cramps for weeks, which was the reason for beginning this pill in the first place.
12	120	My daughter suffered with a heavy flow and debilitating cramps.
12	121	I hope the next birth control pill works for her cramps as well as the rest of her.
12	122	What I've noticed so far is that I'm more moody/emotional, I feel hungrier than usual, my period is lighter but my cramps are still there and they've been there everyday.
12	123	They used to end around the 2nd day but I'm on the 4th day and I still have cramps.
12	124	I can manage cramps and a little moodiness tho, so no biggie.
12	125	My period went from awful heavy and cramping for eight days at a time, to light and easy cramps for four days.
12	126	I also have all of the horrible side effects including cramps, bloating, and breast tenderness.
12	127	My doctor prescribed it to me because I had crippling cramps and nausea.
12	128	The first month my cramps were completly gone and it was amazing, 3 months later they are exactly the same as before I started the pill.
12	129	I've been getting chronic headaches, repressed appetites, spotting, and cramps.
12	130	After a few months my period became lighter and I had less cramps.
12	131	This year was the worst: extreme depression, moodiness, severe cramps, long periods, Etc.
12	132	Headaches, some abdominal cramps.
12	133	Went from getting the most awful, paralyzing cramps and heavy periods (one super plus for every 2 hours) to no cramps at all, and an almost non-existant period (2-3 light tampons per DAY).
12	134	I still had PMS and mild cramps but nothing insane like the beginning.
12	135	Previously, my cramps when I got my period were absolutely horrible.
12	136	It's pretty heavy and I have bad cramps.
12	137	My periods are light and short, and I honestly get about one cramp a month.
12	138	I would rather feel happy, then hinder cramp pain which only lasted a few days anyways.
12	139	Since then, I've only had light cramping here and there but have been spotting every single day (very annoying as I have to wear panty liners every single day and change them often as it's not exactly light spotting).
12	140	10 days, sometimes super late or early, extreme headaches, cramping, nausea and vomiting from pain.
12	141	Placed on it to help regulate my periods and instead I feel like I am on my period 24/7 because of the constant cramping.
12	142	During my periods I  had a few days of cramping but not as bad as I had before (the only good part).
12	143	Well, I started my second pack a little over a week ago and I have had  intense cramping in my lower abdomen/groin, headaches, and even cramping in my legs.
12	144	I've also experienced horrible bloating, cramping, and pelvic and lower back pain.
12	145	Today they are light enough to use a panty liner only, shorter and cramping has been brought down to an all time low.
12	146	bad cramping.
12	147	I used to have incredibly heavy periods with painful cramping, and all of that has completely disappeared!
12	148	Two and a half weeks of constant cramping will, I'm sure, make me less than pleasant when I demand my old birth control.
12	149	Nausea and cramping got worse the week before, during, and after my period.
12	150	I had a relief of not experiencing abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, blood clots and cramping when having my menstrual cycle.
12	151	Fast forward 7 years later- I have those same symptoms---abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, blood clots and cramping.
12	152	So far, very little cramping and NO BLOOD CLOTS and ABDOMINAL PAIN.
12	153	Since being on it, my periods don't last as long and are usually really light, I don't have severe cramping or severe nausea, haven't really spotted.
12	154	It's been very good with almost everything, but it hasn't helped with my cramping.
12	155	I experienced slight nausea and cramping on day 2, but that's gone away.
12	156	The only positives I have experienced are no cramping and stabilized moods.
12	157	I feel bloated and crampy a lot.
12	158	On my second week of the pill, I started feeling crampy and then a day or two later, I got my period.
12	159	Extremely light and short periods, no spotting unless I forget and take my pill too late, no weight gain, and no decreased sex drive that I’ve noticed.
12	160	After taking the placebo pills in month #2 after my period the spotting stopped and everything is back to normal.
12	161	But lately I have had spotting during any week of the month instead of during my off week.
12	162	I also cant take other medication, it causes spotting if I do.
12	163	But just this past month, I started spotting on the 3rd week of active pills.
12	164	I've been on Junel Fe for about 6 months, I'm 21, so far everything is good, I switched pills due to spotting for 60 days straight on a 90 day pills.
12	165	The first week I was spotting - not even enough to have to wear a pad or anything.
12	166	The only problem I experienced in the first month was breakthrough bleeding or spotting around the 2nd to 3rd week of the pills.
12	167	I started spotting but I have another week left of birth.
12	168	I to had night sweats, spotting, migranes, lost feeling in limbs, and nausea in the morning.
12	169	I figured it was spotting but I ended up having to use tampons and pads.
12	170	Also, I did not have spotting, but had my period mid way through the pack, about day 13, all the way till the last pill.
12	171	I would not even get through my 21 day pack before I started spotting bad.
12	172	I'm currently spotting now because the time change through my vacation has apparently messed it up even though I've been taking them the same time.
12	173	After taking it a week I started spotting which turned into full bleeding with clots, and wasn't due for my period for another 2 weeks.
12	174	I still get my normal 3 day period but a few months I had spotting or a longer period.
12	175	The worst thing was during the first three months I had spotting for two weeks then would be off for a week and would spot again for two week.
12	176	So far, I have had a few episodes of mild nausea, and one more serious episode where the nausea was nearly immobilizing and accompanied with harsh pelvic pain and spotting.
12	177	I experienced spotting and light bleeding on the active pills -- which will hopefully subside as the hormones regulate.
12	178	I have been on Junel for several months now and have experienced the following side effects: dry skin on my face, bleeding of the gums, spotting, and crazy moodiness.
12	179	My period was light, only needing a panty liner but I've been spotting for over two weeks now.
12	180	I was on Junel Fe 1/20  for almost 5 months, did not get my period for the first three months and I only had spotting for 2 weeks every month, my acnes got to it's worse level and I experienced some huge acnes on my back too.
12	181	As for spotting, it only happened for a few weeks during my first month on Junel.
12	182	Today I am week three on Sunday and I started have some spotting.
12	183	No bloating, spotting, and weight gain.
12	184	My period consists of 2 weeks of spotting which I find incredibly annoying, I would rather have 1 week of a regular period.
12	185	For the first 3 months I would spot for the entire week before my period would actually start, but I stuck with it since they say your body takes time to get used to it.
12	186	I had random spot pains all over my body, insomnia, throwing up, dizziness, my limbs went numb, and my already diagnosed anxiety and depression got 10x worse.
12	187	I started taking this pill in February and I  spotted everyday for two months.
12	188	Junel was the first pill that I spotted with.
12	189	6 hour headache.
12	190	It did give me a headache for the first few days, but I'm three weeks in and I don't even feel any difference in my body.
12	191	Almost immediately after starting this pill, I began to have vicious headaches for days at a time.
12	192	I was moody, sad, getting horrible headaches weekly and felt anxious all the time.
12	193	Did not experience weight gain, headaches, nausea, etc.
12	194	The headaches started around week 2.
12	195	I am moody, anxious, depressed, exhausted, mild headaches, nauseous.
12	196	Felt dizzy, headaches and nauseous.
12	197	I have also experienced some headaches but I am going to actually take the brown pill this month.
12	198	(I use birth control for hormone headaches)
12	199	I am on Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo and so far it has been a good pill but with major headaches.
12	200	I will say, I have forgotten to take the pill until the next day and felt fine (would still use backup birth control) but the one day I lost the pill and didn't take it at all, I got a massive migraine a couple days later.
12	201	I switched from taking Gildes to Junel, I really liked this pill, my migraines that I usually get on the day of my period went away!!
12	202	I had to be rushed to the hospital last week due to the horrible migraines, pin and needles in my face, numbness and dizziness.
12	203	I felt very angry and hostile I cried over almost anything with terrible migraines and canker sores.
12	204	Been on it for a year a half the only side effect is I usually get migraines around my period.
12	205	But I also have had migraines prior to beginning the pill.
12	206	But 4 months in, I haven’t had any concerning symptoms; no nausea, no drop in sex drive, no weight gain.
12	207	My sex drive is gone.
12	208	But over the past year I have lost my sex drive completely, and now have severe vaginal dryness.
12	209	Although this birth control prevented me from getting pregnant, it also significantly decreased my sex drive, to the point where I’d ask myself, “what’s the point of being on birth control if I never want to have sex with my boyfriend anyway?” That isn’t the worst part though.
12	210	Also, I lost my sex drive in the third year due to dryness in my vagina, so I decided to switch.
12	211	It took away my sex drive as well.
12	212	Same with the sex drive; I haven't noticed much due to not paying attention  and then traumatic experience.
12	213	My sex drive became COMPLETELY nonexistent while on Junel- to the point were I was starting to question my sexuality in general.
12	214	Cons: sex drive gone, irregular periods (even being on this pill for more that a year), more aggressive mood.
12	215	I was in a super terrible moody 24/7, got annoyed very easily, and completely lost my sex drive.
12	216	I have been on this pill for 10 months and I completely lost my sex drive - it wouldn't be a bad thing for people who are single but I am in a committed relationship.
12	217	My sex drive completely disappeared and still took a while to come back after I stopped taking this pill.
12	218	This works as birth control because you won't ever have sex on it since you'll bleed all month long and you'll have no sex drive.
12	219	My sex drive is great, my mood is great and life if great with this pill.
12	220	My sex drive is great.
12	221	I had ZERO sex drive, and the anxiety and anxiety attacks were getting out of hand.
12	222	I'm 21 with no sex drive at all and painful sex with severe dryness.
12	223	The only thing I despise is that it has made me incredibly dry down there and decreased my sex drive.
12	224	No sign of depression, irritability, no change in sex drive, etc.
12	225	I have no sex drive at all.
12	226	I'm 24 yo and my sex drive is nonexistent, that's the main reason I need to switch.
12	227	The only downside to it was my decreased sex drive - which was kind of a big deal.
12	228	But I do have a way lower sex drive, I hardly want to have sex anymore.
12	229	I was excited to start hormonal birth control as I hate condoms with a burning passion, and with such a high sex drive I was excited to not have to bother with condoms anymore.
12	230	Then, I had ZERO sex drive.
12	231	My sex drive completely disappeared which doctors will blame on the depression.
12	232	I actually recently got off of Junel, and since being off I realized I'm much happier, my sex drive has increased, I've been able to lose weight, and I'm not downright exhausted all the time.
12	233	My sex drive before was at an all time high now that I've been on these pills for 3 months it has definitely decreased some.
12	234	Also my sex drive is completely gone.
12	235	It killed my sex drive and made me crazy.
12	236	My sex drive tanked from almost day 1.
12	237	And I have noticed a decrease in sex drive.
12	238	I have been taking this pill for almost a week the only side effect I've had is increase of my breast size (I'm totally ok with this) and my sex drive actually increased
12	239	My sex drive was gone I was nauseated and dizzy all the time I went to my obgyn who then prescribed nuvaring again hated it it fell out, I couldn't use it during intercourse it hurt so bad, nope.
12	240	I lost my sex drive too, I felt Asexual.
12	241	I lost all sex drive.
12	242	I switched to this medicine (from Camrese) mainly suffering from a very decreased sex drive and heavy periods, with very dismal mood swings.
12	243	I am only on the begining of week two, however I've never had a lower sex drive in my life.
12	244	Other than that my libido is as high as ever and no weight gain that I'd personally attribute to the pill.
12	245	One thing that is interesting is the complaints of decrease in libido, which I can't exactly say if I've been experiencing it or not since I've been bleeding.
12	246	I didn't have any negative side effects, except a lower libido which has never really bothered me.
12	247	At first it was great, I could have sex freely and I had no issues (other than weight gain but I expected that).
12	248	I didn’t experience much weight gain, maybe a slight increase in appetite, minimal anxiety.
12	249	No weight gain, mood changes, or anything negative and it cleared up my acne/regulated my periods.
12	250	No weight gain, but I noticed since I began taking it, I had very vivid, disturbing dreams.
12	251	I have no "weight gain, no emotional or mental problems, no anxiety attacks or feel like I am floating," lol These pills are awesome, I even take them so I don't get a period and I haven't had a period in 6 months.
12	252	No significant weight gain or mood swings on this pill.
12	253	It's effective - I have yet to become pregnant, HOWEVER, I've had the worst breakthrough bleeding and weight gain.
12	254	No weight gain or mood swings.
12	255	They haven't cause any weight gain, which seems to be a big concern for people when looking for a pill to try.
12	256	I think that the woman that experienced weight gain were just eating too much and blaming it on the pill, I actually lost from weight ( but I have been trying to by working out more) .
12	257	Yes, it prevented pregnancy but it also made me hormonal, moody, depressed, I began to grow hair on my chin and chest, weight gain, cyst on my breast, hot flashes, and the list goes on.
12	258	no weight gain no babies...that is my goal.
12	259	I have a VERY sensitive system and my main concern was weight gain.
12	260	Yes all birth controls effect people differently but I honestly feel like if you go into it thinking you'll be fine, you won't experience weight gain, you WILL actually be fine.
12	261	For the first month, I had the normal side effects of moodiness, weight gain, nausea, etc.
12	262	Also cleared up my skin big time and no weight gain at all.
12	263	No weight gain so far but I work out 3-5 times a week and drink lots of water.
12	264	I had some weight gain at first, but that's okay now.
12	265	Cramps are the same for me, no weight gain, no difference in moodiness, and actually helped stop breast tenderness for me.
12	266	I experienced a lot of weight gain, but the worst side effect has been dry skin on my face and I have never had skin problems.
12	267	I experienced slight weight gain (about 5 lbs) and slight moodiness/breast tenderness at first but those symptoms went away.
12	268	The biggest issue I had was EXTREME weight gain (not at all in the right places) I had to get off it.
12	269	This medication is the only difference in my life that can account for the weight gain, unless I have some illness or medical problem that I am unaware of (I am only twenty years old with no medical history of any diseases in my family).
12	270	My only fear was the weight gain , but I decided to give it a shot and try to control my PMS .
12	271	I haven't had any breakouts, major weight gain, or bad nausea.
12	272	The worst side effect for me has been weight gain and the inability to lose weight.
12	273	I don't have that issue anymore but I have gained at least 11 lbs in the last 2 months & I'm the type that does not gain weight easily (I've probably gained about a pound a year since 2007).
12	274	I cannot curb my appetite, therefore I’ve gained prob 10 lbs in a month.
12	275	All in all I have only gained around 10 lbs whether it be due to the birth control or taking the desk job.
12	276	I also gained 8 pounds in the 1st 3 weeks of taking it.
12	277	I've gained over 13lbs since the pill, and even if I went to the gym it seemed like a never ending cycle of gain and lose.
12	278	I haven't gained weight but the only problem are the anxiety attacks that I tend to get while on this pill.
12	279	I also gained weight.
12	280	I've gained about 3 lbs already.
12	281	I have horrible sugar cravings and mood swings like crazy and I've gained 10 lbs within the past year.
12	282	I was always sore, tired, gained weight, moody, etc (this was a first gen estrogen pill unlike Junel which is a low dose).
12	283	I gained a little weight and ate like crazy , I tried to get off of it but my doctor says I should take it for 3 months so my body can get used to it .
12	284	In just two weeks of taking this medication, my anxiety and depression became almost unbearable, I gained ten pounds, and I would cry at the drop of a hat.
12	285	I have not gained weight, nor have I lost any.
12	286	I took this pill for 2 years straight, and for me it worked wonders- I gained weight in all the right places (breasts and butt), it prevented pregnancy, and I had clearer skin.
12	287	I also easily lost the weight I gained with the other pill I tried.
12	288	My body is so sensitive that I've even gained weight from a natural progesterone cream.
12	289	I gained 10 pounds, then lost it the week I was off, then gained it back again after the first 7 days of the 2nd pack.
12	290	My breasts seem slightly larger, though I have not gained weight otherwise.
12	291	I gained a little weight at first but my body adjusted about 2 months in.
12	292	Never really had any problems with it, except that once I gained some weight its a lot harder to lose while on the pill.
12	293	It made my face breakout, I gained some weight, and it made me so moody and depressed.
12	294	The only bad thing in my experience is that I've gained 30 pounds in four months while taking this and so far no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to lose any of that extra weight.
12	295	After being on Junel for 5 months I noticed that I gained 10lb and it was a time when I decided to call my doctor to put me on something else.
12	296	Junel Fe has caused me to be come EXTREMELY emotional and I have gained at least 10 pounds in my stomach area.
12	297	Over 3 years I have gained 20-25 lbs.
12	298	This pill made me sick to my stomach everyday, nausea, vomiting, dizzy, lightheaded, you name it - I felt it.
12	299	It made her feel extremely sick - nausea, vomiting & flu-like symptoms.
12	300	The first few days of taking Junel I had nausea, vertigo, and blurred vision.
12	301	The nausea and visions problems disappeared within three days, but the other side effects continued with use.
12	302	Within a week of starting the pack, I had daily nausea, terrible skin, and became incredibly depressed.
12	303	The worst thing for me has to be my breast tenderness and my nausea when I take it in the morning.
12	304	Overall, I had no ill side effects like nausea or head aches and it worked great for me!
12	305	For the first three months I experienced nausea and occasional mood swings, it helped with making my period lighter and regularly on time.
12	306	I had nausea in the beginning but then took it in the evening and much better.
12	307	I had very mild nausea and mood swings for the first 2 months but have not experienced these since.
12	308	I get nauseated for a day or so when I first start my new pack.
12	309	Right after starting it I felt nauseous almost every day, & my anxiety and depression has been the worst it's ever been.
12	310	I also felt nauseous for a good portion of the day, and had no appetite.
12	311	I get nauseous when eating, I feel sick to my stomach.
12	312	My first couple weeks taking it I was nauseous on and off.
12	313	It makes me nauseous.
12	314	I took this birth control for 2 1/2 weeks & I was either extremely nauseous or vomiting everyday that I had taken it.
12	315	Along with the bleeding and stomach pains, I was also nauseous and lost my appetite completely.
12	316	I've also never been more nauseous in my life.
12	317	The only cons I've experienced are some mood swings when I first started that are gone now, and having to take the pill at the same time every day, which is usually not a problem but if I do forget I make sure to use a second contraceptive.
12	318	I tried Sprintec and had crazy mood swings and depression.
12	319	At first, it can be tough with the mood swings but TRUST ME, they go away.
12	320	I have no mood swings due to the pills my hormones are not all over the place which is surprising.
12	321	And if you think people who said if gives them mood swings were being dramatic, they're not.
12	322	I also noticed I was super emotional and had horrible mood swings.
12	323	The mood swings like I am crazy.
12	324	I thought the mood swings, anxiety attacks, extra felt stress was a temporary effect....nope!
12	325	Crazy emotions, anxiety fits, mood swings galore.
12	326	However for the past three months or so, I have had HORRIBLE mood swings, been feeling really depressed, I argue with my boyfriend and minutes later I don't even know what I got mad at (which is not like me at all.)
12	327	However, it gave me constant mood swings and anxiety.
12	328	During the first month or two on this pill, I experienced terrible mood swings and depression.
12	329	before my body adjusted i had really bad mood swings.
12	330	no mood swings.
12	331	This is the only one I could stand to take that didn't cause horrible mood swings and anxiousness.
12	332	This birth control made me gain weight, and has given me some major mood swings.
12	333	only negative is I have pretty bad mood swings, which I had before I was put on birth control, but now they're worse.
12	334	I had horrible mood swings and it affected my relationship even though he understood.
12	335	I dealt with the severe pain, along with mood swings, depression, and anxiety for a few months.
12	336	Upon month 8 I experienced extreme mood swings and depression.
12	337	Would've given it a 10 if it weren't for the mood swings.
12	338	I have had some mood swings and low feelings -- though I experienced this prior in the form of PMS, too.
12	339	Immediately I experienced severe mood swings and depression.
12	340	Again, immediate mood swings, depression, etc.
12	341	However, I have been having the WORST mood swings I have ever had in my life.
12	342	Mood swings were the worst I have ever experienced on any birth control I have ever taken.
12	343	However, my mood swings were TERRIBLE in the beginning.
12	344	Luckily I've previously realized the terrible mood change that some birth control pills cause for me, so when I started getting anxiety and depression after starting this one I knew I needed to quickly give it the boot.
12	345	However, about 5 months in, I started having really bad mood changes.
12	346	I was very nervous to start it after reading reviews but I am SO glad I did!
12	347	I had the pills but was too nervous to take them bc being of Caribbean descent I am not used to taking all kinds of chemical based medication I am so used to healthy diet and such but birth control is birth control I needed something.
12	348	When it was time to start up again I was so nervous with Junel but I have nothing but good things to say.
12	349	I was so nervous to start this because of various negative reviews, but I'm almost finished with my first pack and I've had no horrible side effects at all.
12	350	I've always been an anxious person, this pill made it so much worse.
12	351	I'm anxious out of my mind, having panic attacks.
12	352	It also made me depressed, anxious and crazy moody.
12	353	Every time it was my off week, I became less anxious and felt so much better.
12	354	It has now been 4 months and I am still experiencing anxious symptoms daily.
12	355	I'd get extremely anxious and depressed for a few days and then it would subside (somewhat) for a week or two.
12	356	I couldn't even be out in public without my anxiety starting up.
12	357	On top of all of this, my mood was all over the place, and I started having anxiety that manifested as tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.
12	358	I'll get random burst of anxiety and sweat my butt off.
12	359	I highly advise to not take if you have ANY history of depression or anxiety of ANY sort.
12	360	Yes it did the job but gave me massive anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts.
12	361	Also, even though I've read bad reviews of this birth control due to anxiety and depression-related side effects, I've never experienced any, and I've been diagnosed with both (previous to being on this brand of birth control).
12	362	Near the end of that month, I started getting extreme anxiety with no history of anxiety ever in my life.
12	363	The anxiety wouldn't go away, even at work when I would try and keep myself busy.
12	364	I recently decided to stop taking it because it makes my anxiety a monster that I or my wife do not want to face.
12	365	My wife was previously on Junel and not only did it make her anxiety fly through the roof, but deep dark thoughts do float around in some women who take Junel.
12	366	I went to my primary and she without a doubt said that these birth control pills were causing the anxiety attacks.
12	367	I have a tendency towards some mild anxiety (It is not severe and I choose to not take medication) but not depression, so I could deal with these symptoms (sort of) and figured that I'd ask about switching at my yearly OB/GYN visit.
12	368	If you have some anxiety on it, try daily vitamin B.
12	369	I've been suffering from anxiety recently and a couple months ago I got put on this birth control to help with my worsening PMS symptoms.
12	370	It made my anxiety 10x worse than it already was.
12	371	I haven't slept in over a week from how bad my anxiety gets at night time.
12	372	I think if you have any kind of anxiety or depression, it's best to stay away from this pill.
12	373	I also have anxiety and I cried at everything while on this like everything was heightened.
12	374	I have anxiety attacks on a regular basis.
12	375	I have never had anxiety this bad and I cry all the time over the littlest things!!
12	376	I would not recommend if you struggle with anxiety or depression.
12	377	My depression and anxiety is through the roof and I'm not eating.
12	378	9 months into using it and my moods, anxiety and depression have gotten horrible!
12	379	This birth control gave me the worst anxiety and turned me into a crazy person.
12	380	I've been off it for a month now and I'm back to normal and no longer have terrible anxiety.
12	381	Overall, I had a decent experience, but I decided to try something else to try to get rid of the anxiety.
12	382	Year 2 I started suffering from increased anxiety and what everyone else decided was depression even though I insisted it was fatigue.
12	383	My emotions have been up and down and im suddenly getting really bad anxiety.
12	384	Made my anxiety and depression increase a lot.
12	385	I've been taking Junel for about a month now and I've experienced very sore breasts, stomach pains, and an increase in anxiety and depression.
12	386	If you already have anxiety or depression I don't recommend this pill
12	387	My anxiety has worsened, I get my period 2 times a month on this.
12	388	But so far the worse has been the depression and anxiety.
12	389	I was feeling lethargic, super high anxiety and bouts of depression.
12	390	I have anxiety and depression problems and I'm trying to figure out if it's because of the pill or not.
12	391	It got to the point where my anxiety was so bad I could barely breathe and making it through a day seemed impossible.
12	392	Continued: I experienced some breast tenderness and slight breast growth (I ain't complaining about that) I'm currently in my second pack and experiencing no side effects at all!
12	393	On top of really bad breast tenderness, depression, and my entire body was bloated.
12	394	The first week there was mild bloating and I've had breast tenderness (more than usual) but other than that it's regulated my bleeding and I've gotten no other side effects!
12	395	This medicine has made me moody, severe breast tenderness, and ACNE!
12	396	I haven't experienced any side effects, except now when I start to get my period, my breasts hurt a little bit it goes away once I start.
12	397	I have not had any bacterial or yeast infection which I had that issue with other birth controls.
12	398	Then 5 days into it I developed a terrible yeast infection type rash on my inner thighs.
12	399	This followed with bloating, a yeast infection, and a two week long period.
12	400	Anyway, I have also had three yeast infections AND get my period twice a month with more pain than before.
12	401	I've gotten a couple of yeast infections, but they cleared up with medication.
13	1	Not to mention I feel as if most of my water weight has disappeared post pill, and I don't have any mood swings or acne which is a plus too.
13	2	The cramping I can honestly deal with the worst part is the acne that I have developed!
13	3	I’ve never had acne, now it is constant and I have scarring, seeing derm.
13	4	Following my appointment the bleeding has gotten a little better but the cramps continue, I have gained 9 lbs and have significantly more acne on my face and chest.
13	5	No acne ( I was SO worried about that), no depression (the pill made me very depressed so I had to stop), only a little bit of discomfort every now and then like a "crampy" sensation but would only last a few seconds, and I am spotting just a tad so I have been wearing pantie liners all this time.
13	6	In the beginning I struggled with acne on my face, chest and back.
13	7	I woke up on the 5th day after insertion and my chest and back were covered in acne.
13	8	However, on the 6th day I woke up with horrible acne all over my face.
13	9	I NEVER struggle with acne.
13	10	It’s nice not taking a pill everyday but I don’t know if it’s worth the acne.
13	11	I did notice that I got a little more acne on the chin since I got Kyleena inserted, but it's totally worth the fact that I have a regular light period now, and don't have to worry about having unwanted babies!
13	12	I also have had the worst acne I’ve ever had.
13	13	Would not recommend to someone with bad hormonal acne.
13	14	Granted I’m used to worse, but I highly recommend, got it done Sep 14 stopped spotting Oct. 6, I love kylenna and it was great, I have had barely any body acne.
13	15	No mood swings, acne or weight gain unlike nexplanon and I feel like myself again!
13	16	I've never had acne, but I am currently dealing with a rough breakout (8 bumps appeared on the same day).
13	17	I gave this an 8.0 because I do experience some acne and I still cramp bad occasionally but so worth it!
13	18	No acne.
13	19	I've noticed a plummet in my sex drive, but an improvement in my acne.
13	20	Since then my periods have regulated, but from time to time I still experience horrible cramps & my face acne has been AWFUL the whole time.
13	21	I'm in my 20's (never had acne) I've tried two highly recommended skin care lines and they haven't helped.
13	22	The only reason I'm not giving Kyleena a 10 is because of my acne.
13	23	My partner doesn't feel it during sex, I had no mood changes, no acne, no weight gain, it's the best birth control ever!!
13	24	I can't handle birth control pills (depression, weight gain, acne,  you name it).
13	25	B) Acne has seemed to calm down (back acne was bad at first out of nowhere) I have noticed once or twice every couple months I will wake up and have pretty intense cramping, sweats nausea that comes and goes in waves.
13	26	No acne, no weight gain, no mood swings!
13	27	I have noticed a little acne, but I use essential oils on the area and it's gone within a few hours.
13	28	Since then, I have had ZERO problems- no cramps, no spotting, no acne!
13	29	I do have increased acne, but I expected that when going off the pill.
13	30	The breaking point for me was the acne on my face.
13	31	I've also experienced acne problems which is something I've never had a problem with before.
13	32	I'm getting acne on my face, back and chest.
13	33	Only side effect I've noticed is acne.
13	34	The only negative thing I've noticed so far is an increase in acne where my skin was pretty clear beforehand especially around my chin and I've also been getting headaches every day since I've had the IUD inserted.
13	35	So far I'm loving this basically nonexistent period, no acne, improved sex life and overall I feel happier compared to the pill I was previously taking.
13	36	My acne was out of control for the first 4-5 weeks, but went away.
13	37	It's seem to have helped my acne and I have noticed I'm not as emotional as I've been on other types of birth controls.
13	38	I am breaking out and I'm a little more irritated than usual.
13	39	Compared to my birth control pills: CONS: My cramping is worse, my period is longer, recently have been breaking out consistently PROS: no pill to take every night, 5 years of birth control, sex drive has returned
13	40	And not to mention the pimples I now get...
13	41	I haven’t gotten any cramps but I do get sore breasts the week before my period which I didn’t have before.
13	42	I would leave your insertion day free, as the cramps were too intense to get out of bed.
13	43	I had sharp cramps in my abdomen, back, and thighs for the first week, but a dose of ibuprofen generally took care of that.
13	44	Today I’ve had a few mild cramps but nothing unbearable.
13	45	All in all I felt a few moderate cramps but was not painful.
13	46	After the Kyleena I had some spotting for a few days, and some cramps that were less than what I'd experience on a normal period.
13	47	The insertion was painful but nothing I couldn’t handle, cramps that only lasted for a minute.
13	48	I have no idea now why my gynecologist recommended this to me when I have endometriosis and I wanted something to make my already awful cramps better; now they’re just ten times worse.
13	49	I can’t work when my cramps get this bad and that means I can’t pay my bills.
13	50	I did have the worst cramps hours after the insertion!
13	51	I get my period most of the month with the most horrifying cramps.
13	52	The worst thing is the intensity of the cramps.
13	53	These aren't normal cramps.
13	54	I’ve had normal period cramps ever since (also started my period a couple hours before my insertion).
13	55	So the pain since hasn’t been anything worse than my normal cramps.
13	56	I have had light spotting since insertion and I have cramps quite a bit, so cramps aren’t too horrible and other ones put me in a lot of pain.
13	57	I wanted an IUD because my cramps on my period were so horendous.
13	58	The worst part for me has been the severe “cramps” (they are more like sharp pains if you ask me).
13	59	Now, I’ve just had some bad cramps but the terrible pain only occurred during insertion.
13	60	For the next 2 days I had moderate cramps.
13	61	Since insertion I have had occasional mild-moderate cramps few and far between.
13	62	My doctor gave me a shot of lidocaine in my cervix so I hardly felt anything just 2 cramps the whole time.
13	63	For the past 2 months I have been experiencing the worst cramps EVER that come at very random times.
13	64	I have never given birth before, but I often think that these cramps must be what contractions feel like.
13	65	I've had ultrasounds and I have been told that the IUD has not shifted or anything, so the cause of the cramps is unknown.
13	66	I was able to drive myself home and the pain after is just some cramping similar to period cramps.
13	67	I was previously on the pill for 10 years, with my periods being extremely light and only lasting for 3 or 4 days and no cramps.
13	68	I get waves of very bad cramps the week before and throughout the period.
13	69	I have constant cramps and my bleeding is random, long, and heavy.
13	70	After the first hour pain lessened but still horrible cramps, couldn’t leave the heating pad for even a second.
13	71	Period cramps are worse.
13	72	The first month was not bad, mild cramps and a little bit of bleeding.
13	73	I get severe stab-like cramps nearly daily.
13	74	With that being said, the insertion was not the most pleasant experience (2 bad cramps and a heat flash) but it only took 3-5 minutes.
13	75	I had it put in the beginning of December, and had cramps so debilitating on Christmas that I basically missed it.
13	76	I still have severe cramps very often that are not aligned with my period.
13	77	I had zero pain during insertion, just slight uncomfortable pressure and mild cramps after.
13	78	Insertion was horribly painful, and the rest of that day I was in EXCRUCIATING pain - think of the worst period cramps you’ve ever had and multiply it by 70.
13	79	If it weren’t for the cramps, this would be awesome.
13	80	I would not recommend trying to drive yourself home afterwards, because cramps and dizziness remain, although are relieved with a heating pad.
13	81	I got my hopes too high because now my period is 8 days if I'm lucky and the cramps I get are almost unbearable.
13	82	Now I just feel like I have normal period cramps but two extra strength tylenol when I got home really helped.
13	83	I just got my Kyleena placed on the 16th of November, I am still cramping but that’s to be expected anyways, each day gets better and better for the cramps though, so far I really like it, I can’t feel the IUD I just have the cramping from my uterus returning to it’s normal place, it’s great.
13	84	I had some pretty terrible cramps for the next few hours that didn’t go away till noon the next day.
13	85	Other than that it hasn’t been terrible, some mild cramps here and there but I feel great, no bad side effects yet, but I’m supposed to get my period soon so I guess that’s going to be the ultimate test.
13	86	(I had just got off my period on the 25th) The procedure wasn't too bad just a few bad cramps.
13	87	Since then, I have had spotting every day and most days have cramps.
13	88	However after that I had cramping everyday and had to take ibuprofen and the last couple of weeks I had very painful cramps.
13	89	The sonographer found that I had a ruptured cyst on one of my ovaries she explained that could have been the reason for the recent painful cramps.
13	90	Insertion was very easy, however, about an hour or so after insertion I had cramps similar to labor pains than period cramps.
13	91	I still occasionally had intense cramps for the first couple of months especially during my period.
13	92	About every other day I have cramps and will get a very sharp pain in my uterus for 10 seconds to a full minute multiple times a day.
13	93	I had a lot of spotting and I would get intermittent cramps a lot.
13	94	Just be patient, it does take a toll on your sex life in the beginning since you are just constantly spotting and when you aren't spotting getting cramps but overall it was definitely worth it not having to worry about other contraception.
13	95	I felt better once the clamp was taken off but slowly started to get cramps.
13	96	Now I'm home laying in bed with a heating pad with some cramps.
13	97	I’ve had the Kyleena IUD for just over 3 months, (I have like no pain tolerance) it was incredible painful the day I got it inserted, on the way home I had to sit with the seat laid back and my feet on the dash to find a little comfort, ever since when my period come I cramp really badly starting a few days before, lasting thill the end of my period, I also spot for like a week after my period, my cramps are to a level now that sometimes I can’t move and I just wanna drop, I’ve got hold of my gyn to get it removed, I can’t do the pain anymore, I have PCOS and it’s more painful than my first period after 8 months without one, it’s almost as bad as cyst bursting on my ovaries pain wise.
13	98	There were two, short-lived, intense cramps; one for the sounding and one for the actual placement of the IUD.
13	99	The insertions was not the worst feeling, as I got a vaginal biopsy the week before, but the cramps after were excruciating.
13	100	I was fine a couple days after, but after the first few weeks I would experience gut wrenching cramps.
13	101	The rest just felt like really bad menstrual cramps.
13	102	Bleeding and mild off and on cramps lasted for about a week.
13	103	But even my own period cramps make me cry.
13	104	I got spotting almost every day, and I'm still on ubiprofen because of the cramps.
13	105	No worse than regular cramps.
13	106	For about 4 weeks, I experienced irregular, light spotting, no pain for my partner or myself during sex, no ache to speak of, and only a few, intense, deep contraction-like cramps.
13	107	Although it does give me some pretty awful cramps just before I'm going to start my period, that's nothing a little Advil and heat won't fix.
13	108	I have been on my period since that day, but it had been light with no cramps up until a week ago, where my period got heavier and I started having severe cramps.
13	109	I have bad cramps during my period and this was just like one of those but only lasted 15 seconds.
13	110	Have very very very mild cramps now.
13	111	I woke up feeling better no cramps however I still feel like there is so much pressure on my uterus.
13	112	I have very regular periods, I tried the pill which helped with cramp but only a short amount of time, my periods were light 3-4 days and very regular (28 or so) even off the pill, they only got betteR\on the pill but my problem was weight gain depression and cramps that came back.
13	113	The last month or so I would get awful cramps at least once a day and I was spotting for a little over a month too.
13	114	Now that I am going on month 2 though the cramps have lightened a lot and the bleeding is so light that it's not even there.
13	115	Insertion was not a big deal and was definitely NOT the worst pain of my life, just felt uncomfortable and like bad deep period cramps.
13	116	No cramps there but maybe because I was focusing on a bar being cut out of my arm!!
13	117	The cramps I had last month from my menstruation had me pass out twice, and the cramps from getting Kyleena almost put me under, too.
13	118	It was moved during sex one night and caused severe cramps for about 10 mins, had to take 2 extra strength Tylenol to even touch the pain.
13	119	My last period was light spotting for about a 12 days, no cramps.
13	120	I have had period cramps that were worse and after giving birth, it was nothing.
13	121	The cramps are so intense I can barely sit down or even lay down it's that bad I have to stand up the whole time I just hope the cramps go away.
13	122	When they put the kyleena in me it hurt at first and then I started to cramp I laid down for a couple mins and then I was fine but ever since then I've been getting cramps in the morning around 11-2 it's horrible I rate it a 5 because how horrible it is for me right now but I hope it gets better.
13	123	I had cramps most of the rest of yesterday, ate a lot and rested.
13	124	I bleed for about 3-4 days and had slight cramping but now I spot every here or there and don't really have cramps anymore.
13	125	After that day my IUD was great for about 3 weeks and then I would randomly get intense cramps every few days and spotting.
13	126	I took 550 mg of naproxen an hour before insertion, and I only had two sharp cramps, both of which only lasted a few seconds.
13	127	Expect that when they insert there will be an overwhelming burning , bad cramp that lasts really over 15/30 seconds, my doctor was amazing and made my entire insertion experience within under 10 mins, just know, the medicine they prescribe you to take the night before WILL cause cramping, I didn't even think of it so I went to bed all peaceful and woke up sweating to very bad cramps, and then the the day you get it expect bad cramps for a couple hours and it'll go away, and then the all today I didn't experience any cramping what so ever and then surprise!
13	128	Spotting = period on the right time, cramps are back!
13	129	I drove home with extreme cramps and was in my bed with a heating pad and ibuprofen for the rest of the day.
13	130	After insertion I had no cramps and spotted for about an hour.
13	131	There were about 3 big cramps for me.
13	132	Several hours after insertion I felt a lot of momentarily dehabilitating cramps but they came and went.
13	133	I really have nothing bad to say besides after insertion I got TERRIBLE cramps, I normally do get cramps when on my period so cramping was very uncomfortable.
13	134	I bled the entire first month and had cramps so bad I had to sit down.
13	135	My first period after the insertion though the cramps were more severe than anything I've ever experienced.
13	136	The first month was rough...the cramps were bad all the time and same with the bleeding.
13	137	After the first month I still got cramps but not as bad as the first.
13	138	The reason I rated a 9/10 is the bad cramps I still sometimes get.
13	139	The day of the insertion I had annoying cramps but a day later and I feel SO much better; woke up feeling brand new.
13	140	I had cramps the whole week of my period and then they went away.
13	141	I had paragauard for two years even though I had heavy periods and VERY bad cramps.
13	142	The first day I started to bleed, my cramps continued to a full period and my cramps were more painful than it ever was before.
13	143	No cramps, no pain.
13	144	I bled all day yesterday with a couple intense cramps here and there but here I am the next day no cramps or bleeding..YAY!!
13	145	I had a lot of pressure and some bloating for about 24-48 hours, which I didn't mind much since I get intense cramps from my periods.
13	146	I go through 3 pairs of panties a day because of how much I spot and I have really bad cramps from time to time.
13	147	Had sex again more recently and started bleeding profusely w/ cramps .
13	148	I had some minor cramps for the rest of the day, but some ibuprofen took care of it.
13	149	I had super bad cramps for about 3-4 hours and some light bleeding.
13	150	After I took the two Tylenol and napped, I felt a ton better and only had light cramps.
13	151	Second day, I barely spotted and had minimal cramping and today I have no spotting/bleeding and no cramps.
13	152	First day I had period-like cramps.
13	153	At this point, minimal spotting and cramps here and there.
13	154	I'm currently on my first period post insertion and I feel like it'll never end, it's very light and hardly any cramps.
13	155	The cramps afterwards only lasted that same day and were bearable and pretty much gone 24 hours later.
13	156	Since getting Kyleena I have very dull and barely even painful cramps during a period and not as much vaginal discharge either.
13	157	I woke up the next morning with the worst cramps of my entire life!!
13	158	When putting it in, the first 10sec felt like I was having normal period cramps, then for another 15sec it felt like I was having the worst cramps of my entire life, but after that it went back to minimal cramping.
13	159	I originally got the Mirena in order to lighten my period and to resolve the severe cramps associated with getting my monthly cycle.
13	160	The first day I had cramps really bad and the insertion process hurt for me as well.
13	161	I was fine for about three days, no cramping or bleeding, until the fourth day when I woke up at 4 in the morning crying because the cramps were so unbearable.
13	162	I have never felt cramps like this before, so immediately I called my doctor.
13	163	My body is still getting used to this and I have recently had a miscarriage so I'm thinking I'll spot and have light cramps for a few more weeks.
13	164	I was sick all night and had HORRIBLE cramps, but the Dr said that is normal if you have not had kids because of how shut the cervix is.
13	165	I felt some strong cramps during but was able to return to work as normal about half an hour later.
13	166	Cramping was not enjoyable the first night, and I had Advil and Tylenol on repeat with my hot water bottle, however I woke up the next day with no cramps and a few spots.
13	167	But now going on the third day I am bleeding pretty bad but no cramps.
13	168	This was weird for me because I normally don't get cramps at all.
13	169	Procedure took less than 2 minutes and was literally 2 SMALL cramps.
13	170	I had some spotting every once and awhile and random cramps, but nothing ibuprofen couldn't take care of.
13	171	My period started 3 days after insertion and lasted about 4 days - very light and no cramps at all (usually I'm cramping quiet heavy!).
13	172	The insertion hurt, but it just felt like typical period cramps.
13	173	The placing only felt like cramps, but I'm not the type to have cramps while being on my monthly.
13	174	I felt two cramps that felt like my period just started and it took 2 minutes!
13	175	I am still having some cramps and discomfort and it's almost been 24 hours but nothing unbearable.
13	176	I started having horrendous cramps.
13	177	I bleed the for the whole 2 months, I had migraines and severe cramps.
13	178	Worst cramps of your life .
13	179	The cramps are the equivalent of having a csection with no anesthesia .
13	180	Today,  the cramps were a bit bad.
13	181	I even had bad rectum spasms or cramps and a bad odor.
13	182	All in all, I do not regret getting the Kyleena, just ready for the cramps to go away.
13	183	I'm entering week 4 of being on my period with severe cramps.
13	184	Hopefully the bleeding and cramps subside.
13	185	In high school, pre birth control, I had periods where the cramping was so bad I'd pass out, so it just felt like one of my old period cramps, honestly.
13	186	My doctor gave me painkillers about an hour before and I took another one after the procedure, as I was prepared for heavy cramps.
13	187	I've had some cramps the afternoon right after inserting, but not more than during my period.
13	188	Afterwards I took 800mg of Ibuprofen and there were cramps.
13	189	I never have had cramps before so it was kinda painful.
13	190	I am now resting in bed the cramps are still hurting a little.
13	191	Of course I had cramps afterwards but they went away after a week or so.
13	192	I also have the worst cramps of my life to the point where I became nauseous got back aches and felt dizzy.
13	193	All I felt was a lot of pressure and slight cramps after the insertion.
13	194	I've had zero cramps, zero spotting, I feel perfectly normal.
13	195	My first period was pretty heavy last month and I had really bad cramps but that was expected.
13	196	Super light and no cramps.
13	197	I only felt two sharp cramps during the whole process.
13	198	The initially insertion was very painful, like two really bad cramps (although I have a very high pain tolerance).
13	199	So far I have not had any cramps.
13	200	I had really bad cramps on and off up until last week, but they have gone away.
13	201	No spotting, cramps, anything!
13	202	The cramps that night were AWFUL, but I slept with a heating pad.
13	203	While my first 2 months were a bit rocky, my third month on Kyleena has been much smoother (less cramps, less spotting).
13	204	My third period was super easy (5 days, with the heaviest two days filling one diva cup each, a few cramps on heavy days, but not too bad).
13	205	Later on I experienced 2 sharp cramps and cramping through out the night.
13	206	My first period included pretty bad cramps and prolonged bleeding, but after that I stopped bleeding, except for occasional spotting.
13	207	After that it was just like regular period cramps.
13	208	The cramps were pretty bad by then.
13	209	I got the kyleena inserted today and experienced the worst cramps in my life.
13	210	The last 4 hours has been the worst in my entire life so far I have really bad cramps now 10/10 and nausea.
13	211	I would describe it as having medium period cramps.
13	212	It was the worst three cramps of my life.
13	213	Since then, I have only had a few minor cramps and some spotting.
13	214	This being said I have never had period cramps before and was not used to it.
13	215	The insertion process was pretty uncomfortable, but there were only about 3 big cramps that just felt like bad period cramps.
13	216	I took 3 Ibuprofen prior to coming in and that helped keep the cramps at bay for a while, but you will experience cramps for the first couple of days.
13	217	They just feel like period cramps, no worse.
13	218	I've had mild to severe cramps for my periods my whole life.
13	219	During the insertion I experienced what felt like 2 of the worst period cramps I could ever have (I screamed).
13	220	I had some bad cramps following the insertion for a few days and some light spotting.
13	221	About two weeks later I was having terrible cramps and my period started.
13	222	I have been bleeding for about 5 weeks, with intermittent uncomfortable cramps.
13	223	I was able to drive back home 15 mins after the procedure finished, the cramps went away a few hours later after lying on my bed and dozing off.
13	224	The cramps that I've experienced afterwards were probably the worst I've experienced personally considering I have never really had menstrual cramps during my regular periods.
13	225	Pain rating for my cramps I would rate a 7/10.
13	226	I am 28, mother of two and I go through severe menstrual cramps each month.
13	227	Today (one day later) the cramps are very small and infrequent.
13	228	The LPN sounded my uterus, which brought on like 2 mild cramps.
13	229	I had maybe 3 or 4 sharpish cramps, but it was not the unbearable pain others have described it as.
13	230	I had some cramps throughout the day, but mainly in my back.
13	231	The 2 cramps that occurred during the insertion were the worst pains I have ever felt.
13	232	I had cramps & spotting for 2 days after & have not had any symptoms since except for some minor rare cramping.
13	233	I have only experienced cramps and a appetite increase.
13	234	I feel cramps and discomfort down there as if I had "something" stuck inside, it may be due to my cervix being "messed" with.
13	235	I spent the next two days in bed with awful cramps, but by day three was feeling back to normal.
13	236	I still spot regularly, but the cramps are now rare, and less intense.
13	237	The  first few days I had cramps which is typical, but they were bearable.
13	238	The insertion process was fairly painful, a few large cramps that lasted a few minutes and lots of pressure.
13	239	Yes there are two big cramps that you feel because they're dilating you and putting something up there.
13	240	Now two weeks later I'm experiencing severe cramps that are almost like painful contractions.
13	241	I experienced severe cramps for 2-3 weeks that seemed worse than any cramp I've had before my 6 years on a pill contraceptive.
13	242	My doctor told me I would feel some slight cramping, but instead I had the worst cramps I've ever experienced.
13	243	For the rest of the day, I had very bad cramps.
13	244	On the third day, I got my period and also had very bad cramps.
13	245	I was ok for the rest of that day but the following two days I had cramps that were mildly painful and some dried period blood.
13	246	The bright side was that it only lasted about 40 seconds total and then the cramps calmed down.
13	247	8 Days later and I still have moderate cramps, hoping they subside soon.
13	248	A few days I've had no cramps at all, and other days I'm woken up at 3am!
13	249	I had no cramping or bleeding since it was inserted but now four days later out of no where I have the worst cramps - so bad that I can't even stand up but still no bleeding.
13	250	I've had very minimal period cramps all day after having the Kyleena inserted, and a very small amount of bleeding but besides that it isn't too bad at all!
13	251	I had mine put in yesterday, and because it was the first invasive procedure my body got to experience I started throwing up halfway into it, it felt like terrible cramps, more than I'm used to.
13	252	I had cramps all day and felt pretty crappy.
13	253	Afterwards I had horrible cramps.
13	254	An hour after the procedure I feel like a 3/10 normal cramp pain.
13	255	I felt a mild cramp then a 2 sharp stabbing pains in my cervix.
13	256	It was like a period cramp but the whole insertion procedure lasted around 3 mins.
13	257	I was dreading the insertion but it was quick (about 1 minute) and for about 30 seconds, it just felt like a bad cramp.
13	258	I’ve noticed I do not have the same sex drive as before because I tend to cramp afterwards.
13	259	Didn't cramp afterwards, didn't spot afterwards, totally normal.
13	260	I love the IUD because of how effective it is and you don't have to worry about taking a pill at the same time everyday, but oh my goodness every time I get a cramp I want to cry...
13	261	I took 800mg ibuprofen beforehand, but other than that no cytotec, no numbing stuff and it really did just feel like a period cramp - definitely NOT the worst pain of my life, and definitely NOT unbearable.
13	262	I thought I would cramp and be super uncomfortable all day as all the reviews I read said they were that way.
13	263	I don’t normally have super heavy periods or cramp, so I didn’t think I would cramp upon insertion.
13	264	The only part that bothered me was the clamp on my cervix, that pinched at first and then just felt like a mild cramp.
13	265	The actual procedure only took a couple of minutes - similar to a pap with a really bad period cramp at the end.
13	266	It just felt like a really deep cramp, but then it went away.
13	267	I had Kyleena inserted six months ago, I took ibuprofen beforehand was pretty nervous after reading some wild IUD stories, but the processes was quick and probably a 2/10 on the pain scale- it just felt like one big bad period cramp.
13	268	The insertion was what I had read about it was a really strong period cramp.
13	269	The insertion was the worst pain I've  felt in my whole life, like one big period cramp except deeper inside of you, like you can feel your cervix being like OUCH whats going on here??
13	270	The day of insertion, it hurt like a bad cramp being inserted and then I felt fine.
13	271	I didn't really cramp after the insertion, just had some weird twinges.
13	272	It was one cramp bigger than the last cramp.
13	273	I would recommend having a driver because I am experiencing some cramping, but it feels just like a period cramp.
13	274	But it didn't hurt any more than abnormal period cramp.
13	275	Insertion was mostly just uncomfortable, one bad cramp when she inserted the IUD 3 or 4/10 on the pain scale but only lasted for about 5 seconds.
13	276	I have a very low pain tolerance so I was nervous about how it feel, but placement only lasted maybe five minutes and felt more like a period cramp than anything painful.
13	277	Insertion felt like a very brief, sharp cramp.
13	278	Then it just felt like a large cramp.
13	279	The pain level was maybe 7/10, felt like the worst cramp I've ever had and lasted 30 seconds.
13	280	Pain was just located higher up along naval and it was no worse for me than a localized period cramp.
13	281	INSERTION: Personally, the insertion was not bad for me; it felt like a mild cramp and I was able to go right back to work after.
13	282	The placement wasn't bad just felt like a really bad cramp.
13	283	Next hour, pain scale 2 -like a cramp, but enough to drive home and go to the market.
13	284	Since then, I spotted around ovulation, but I have not had any major cramp.
13	285	I'm 19 and have never had kids and insertion just felt like an intense period cramp.
13	286	However, after it was in place I only got small cramp.
13	287	Overall, the insertion was super easy and I only had a tiny cramp during the whole process.
13	288	Insertion was only uncomfortable because of the speculum, the actual insertion of the IUD was a small cramp.
13	289	Mine was painless just a moderate cramp and it was done.
13	290	It was just a sharp, intense menstrual cramp only for a few seconds
13	291	Yes you will feel a cramp and a pinch, but it's not too much worse than getting scraped when you get a Pap smear or a body piercing.
13	292	What I liked about the Kyleena: insertion only felt like a bad cramp, my periods were lighter & cramp-free, no weight gain (actually experienced weight loss from my own effort to prep for spring break), my well-endowed partner did not feel the strings, and I did not get pregnant.
13	293	If you have a good doctor, he or she will warn you when you're about to cramp so you can expect it.
13	294	I got kyleena inserted last week and just like everybody says it was painful but only for about 30 seconds it feels like a very strong period cramp nothing too bad.
13	295	I took 800mg Ibruprofen an hour before and it still really hurt, like the most painful cramp ever.
13	296	I got the kyleena inserted about four days ago and it only felt like a big cramp for an hour after.
13	297	It felt like more than a strong cramp...
13	298	Insertion went better then I thought basically just feels like a big cramp.
13	299	When I had it inserted the pain was like a bad cramp, but I've experienced worse.
13	300	I had some mild cramping but felt normal after a couple of days.
13	301	The insertion itself was painful for me, I felt very dizzy and almost fainted - however I went back to normal within about 30 minutes and had minor cramping the rest of the day.
13	302	Other than the cramping and the spotting I love the Kyleena and would definitely recommend it to someone.
13	303	As long as the cramping stays at its current level I am experiencing now for a few days, it will all be fine.
13	304	Pain during procedure was mostly very uncomfortable than painful, just a really sharp pinch and pretty bad cramping when it is actually inserted.
13	305	The cramping after was the worst part for me.
13	306	My MD didn’t give me the cervix softer this time bc he says it can actually make cramping worse.
13	307	So far I have been having two spotty periods a month with bad cramping but it is getting better, using the heating pad less.
13	308	Minor break outs that I didn't experience before and mild cramping for a week or so after.
13	309	I had a little spotting after and some cramping.
13	310	I had pretty bad cramping and had to avoid exercise for about 3-4 days after insertion, which wasn't too bad.
13	311	I had some spotting that day and mild cramping, but felt fine.
13	312	The procedure was pretty unbearable and I had very bad cramping for about 6 hours after.
13	313	She expected me to have some severe cramping immediately after - but it took my uterus an hour to deliver those.
13	314	However, before the IUD, I was the girl who never experienced cramping at all.
13	315	The ONLY down fall I have experienced after having an IUD for 6+ months is the cramping.
13	316	I always know when my period is coming because I have a day of serious cramping before it starts.
13	317	Still cramping so bad can’t see straight.
13	318	I sometimes get severe cramping after inserting a tampon or after sex.
13	319	The worst part is the cramping, though.
13	320	Afterwards I had a little cramping for an hour and some bleeding but I went to the gym literally right after leaving the doctor!
13	321	The cramping has lessened since insertion day.
13	322	After insertion I had felt dizzy, nauseous and the worst cramping I’ve ever had.
13	323	I have now been on this IUD for 5ish months and I was told that my period would lighten and maybe even go away and cramping would be minimal.
13	324	While I was on the pill my period was 4 days and didn't have much cramping.
13	325	I am still bleeding and having mild cramping TODAY.
13	326	Initial insertion was painful but after a few days it got better with the cramping.
13	327	All of the cramping and bleeding makes my sex drive drop quite a bit, I hope it gets better.
13	328	Some cramping but nothing terrible.
13	329	I also did not take any medication prior to insertion.The procedure lasted only a few minutes with intense cramping, though not unbearable.
13	330	The rest of the day, I laid in bed with cramping and bleeding.
13	331	But afterward the cramping died down and I was cramping/light spotting on and off for 2 days.
13	332	Only recently has the cramping stopped.
13	333	Today, I’ve been having some cramping, but I’m also on my period, so I’m not sure if the cramping is due to the IUD or my period.
13	334	The insertion hurts like a cramping feeling for a few minutes at the most.
13	335	Mild cramping after (: not nearly as bad as all these reviews make it out to be!
13	336	The placement wasn’t nearly as painful for me as others have said- about 30 seconds of uncomfortable cramping and then none since.
13	337	So far, cramping hasn't been much of a problem.
13	338	1 minute of dizziness, a smidge of light cramping, and  some light spotting afterwards.
13	339	So far only had cramping on the first night and super light spotting here and there.
13	340	Then nothing besides cramping for the first week.
13	341	Slight cramping the second week and nothing since.
13	342	I had moderate-severe cramping the first two weeks and I spotted as well for about 2 months.
13	343	Just slight cramping and occasional mood swings.
13	344	I was cramping horribly until about an hour ago.
13	345	Constant bleeding and cramping, but tough it out!
13	346	I only felt slight cramping a few times during insertion.
13	347	I just started to bleed very very lightly today with very mild cramping so I'm waiting to see if it is my period.
13	348	Today I have no cramping and feel back to normal.
13	349	A little bit of cramping here and there the first week but I think I just really liked my heating pad.
13	350	Let me tell you whoever said slight cramping is crazy it was the worst pain I have ever felt.
13	351	It's been about 5 hours since it's been inserted still having slight cramping but nothing as bad.
13	352	but after they put it in it didn't hurt that bad and I had cramping for a bit.
13	353	I had some moderate cramping that evening, and otherwise it's been great!
13	354	I'm expecting my first period with it in the next day or so, and I'm having more cramping than usual, but I understand that's pretty normal for your first period with an IUD.
13	355	afterwards I felt a little feverish the rest of the day with a little bit of cramping on and off for the next few days.
13	356	The procedure took about 15 minutes, the pressure of putting it in a little further so that it was in all the way was a little painful and like a sharp cramping feeling, afterwards I felt a bit light headed and laid there for about 5 minutes and then I was on my way.
13	357	I started getting my period every 2 weeks with unbearable cramping,very painful bowel movements during them for the first 3 months of having the Kyleena in.
13	358	I got home and had unbearable cramping the entire day... 9:30 AM-8 PM.
13	359	The first week after - heavy cramping, heavy bleeding, dizziness, fatigue.
13	360	I had intense cramping for about an hour or two afterwards, but then it subsided.
13	361	I took 600mg of ibuprofen before which helped the cramping after-- was able to go back to work just fine.
13	362	My gynecologist prescribed me misoprostol (Cytotec) to insert vaginally the night before and I was very nervous after reading online that it can actually make cramping post insertion worse.
13	363	I experienced no cramping after taking Cytotec.
13	364	The insertion felt like a pinch and then mild period cramping, but when I returned home I had the most serious cramping I'd ever had the rest of the night.
13	365	It's been 10 hour since I got it and I still have cramping, hoping it will go away soon!
13	366	Everything seems to be fine, even got an ultrasound but this cramping is still going on three days later.
13	367	Went back to work right after, and had since cramping the rest of the day and took some more ibuprofen before bed.
13	368	Minimal cramping only around my period, which was very light.
13	369	The rest of the day I had no cramping and only light spotting.
13	370	Still no cramping just spotting.
13	371	My first period after Kyleena (the end of June) I had very heavy cramping.
13	372	The next day was much better and the cramping was gone by day three.
13	373	The only bad symptom I experienced was cramping at the beginning of my period but it only lasted one day.
13	374	I had minor cramping that made me feel a little crabby the rest of the day with light bleeding.
13	375	Things are good now just cramping off and on and spotting.
13	376	I've had a tiny bit of cramping here and there but I went to work for 10 hours after and went running.
13	377	Now, I'm cramping a lot!
13	378	Also buy a heat pad for after because you will experience some cramping.
13	379	I had very light cramping, and it was effective immediately (so worry free sex, yay!)
13	380	I have had the Kyleena in since early March 2017 and in the beginning was really regretting it because I felt like I was constantly bleeding and cramping.
13	381	No more cramping, no more clotting and best of all I haven't gotten a period.
13	382	Right around the 80th day I started feeling tender breast, light cramping, and having to get up more in the middle of the night to go take pee….
13	383	I am also still cramping, mostly in mornings.
13	384	It's quick between 2-3 minutes followed by moderate cramping for a few hours.
13	385	I'm cramping a little this morning, but nothing too bad.
13	386	I've had it placed for about an hour and I just have minor cramping, I will update after I've had it some time longer.
13	387	I was also passing large amounts of tissue, and experienced heavy cramping until I decided to get the IUD removed at the end of May.
13	388	I had some bad cramping afterwards, for about 2 hours.
13	389	I have had some cramping since insertion!
13	390	I am 21, no children and was on depo for 2 years with no periods, cramping or spotting.
13	391	Directly after the tools were removed it went up to about a 9.5/10 for a few hours, gradually got better and now 10 hours later the cramping is barely there.
13	392	I had minimal cramping afterwards, no bleeding, and only some lightheadedness but only when I exerted myself.
13	393	I haven't felt cramping in a couple of hours .
13	394	Afterward I had horrible cramping for about 5 minutes and then that dissipated.
13	395	I had contractions for an hour and intense cramping the rest of the day.
13	396	I experienced cramping for about an hour after insertion with sweating and lightheadedness due to the pain, but found that lying down made the pain 10 times better than sitting because driving back was terrible.
13	397	I had very bad cramping and was feeling dizzy for about a half hour after insertion, so my doctor just had me lay down, drink water, and take ibuprofen, but afterwards I was able to walk home from my appointment!
13	398	I had bad cramping for about two days after, but it is a small price to pay to not have to worry about birth control for 5 years.
13	399	I had bad cramping with my first period with Kyleena, but 6 months in my period is VERY light.
13	400	I've spotted since then, but now I'm like actually bleeding a lot and I'm cramping a lot.
13	401	Eventually, we kept going & I was cramping for a while after that.
13	402	The cramping persisted for me at its worst for about 2 hours, and for the next 6 I experienced bad cramping but it was manageable!
13	403	I did have midday cramping.
13	404	Now on the 3rd day I have little to no cramping !
13	405	I have a high paint tolerance but a narrow uterus and found insertion to be extremely painful as well as extreme cramping for the next 3-4 days.
13	406	Once it was over I was fine, but I did have severe cramping for hours after until the medicine they gave me finally kicked in.
13	407	I was taking ibuprofen for about a week because I was still experiencing cramping.
13	408	I felt fine after, just a bit of cramping and lower back pain like you would have starting your period.
13	409	Today I have minor cramping, nothing crazy.
13	410	All day I've been cramping and slightly bleeding.. which is annoying considering the fact I just gotten off a 7 day period.
13	411	Surprisingly it was minor minor cramping and it didn't hurt.
13	412	I haven't had a period in two years (I was on Depo Provera), so I haven't experienced and cramping in a long time.
13	413	I never really had period cramping, so I knew going in that this could be painful.
13	414	I think the reason many girls say it was the worst pain they've ever felt is because they've never experienced moderate menstrual cramping.
13	415	I have been bleeding, clotting and cramping all day.
13	416	I continued cramping that whole day and the following one.
13	417	Then, I spotted for 2 weeks, with regular cramping, usually not lasting more than an hour (but what an unpleasant hour!)
13	418	I stopped spotting and cramping one week before my first period.
13	419	the pain was only slight cramping for few seconds while inserting.
13	420	I experienced a little cramping within the first hour and then it went away.
13	421	I experienced minimal spotting and cramping for the next few days and basically just wore a heating pack all weekend.
13	422	In the last few days I've had some mild cramping but it may be because my period is coming up.
13	423	I had mild cramping and moderate back aches.
13	424	I have had a lot of cramping.
13	425	For the next 10 days, I had some cramping and some brown discharge.
13	426	(I never had much cramping during my periods and I took 800mg of ibuprofen before insertion) I spotted for a couple hours after insertion, but it's been a week and I've seen no signs of blood.
13	427	I didn't have any spotting until 4 days later and minimal cramping nothing to bad.
13	428	I did have a little bleeding and cramping but now it's the second day and I am not experiencing either symptom.
13	429	I have also experienced a lot of cramping and some mood swings.
13	430	At first I bled for about two days and had slight cramping after insertion.
13	431	I probably went a week without bleeding but continued to have the cramping.
13	432	I still have a great libido as of now so besides the bleeding and cramping it's been a good experience.
13	433	I bled lightly-moderately for about a month straight afterwards until my next period came (I could tell because I was VERY crampy and had very heavy bleeding).
13	434	Stayed home from work that day, was quite crampy.
13	435	I am five hours post-insertion and I just feel crampy.
13	436	Overall I’ve been super crampy for the past few days.
13	437	The next day I was crampy all day and sluggish feeling.
13	438	The next couple days I felt a little more crampy than usual but I was able to go about my day to day activities no problem!
13	439	I just got the kyleena this Monday it was 9/18/17 and so far it has been horrible I am very crampy in the morning time but not bleeding I am also sick which is not good not too sure if I should call the doctor or not about this because I am not bleeding but very crampy in the morning.
13	440	It was just very uncomfortable and very crampy.
13	441	I just got my kyleena IUD 2 days ago so far I've been really crampy & also nauseous not only that I know they say you are not suppose to feel the iud but I swear when I bend I can feel it so idk if its just my body trying to adjust to it or what but so far I am very uncomfortable.
13	442	The procedure seemed to take forever to me but so far I'm gonna give it a month to see how it acts I really hope it helps with my heavy crampy periods.
13	443	Spotted for about 1 week and was severely bloated, constipated, and crampy.
13	444	I was very crampy and even a tad bit nauseous for the rest of the day.
13	445	I have been very crampy since the procedure but nothing ibuprofen, a heating pad, and Netflix can't fix.
13	446	It was just uncomfortable and a little crampy but not bad at all.
13	447	A week later got my period, crampy but tolerable.
13	448	I was pretty crampy for the rest of the day.
13	449	It's been about 3 hours now and all I feel is a little crampy.
13	450	Had Kyleena for 1 week now and I feel like I have gained weight, skin is now dry and flakey, and been bleeding and a little crampy since.
13	451	I was crampy for about fifteen minutes after, but was able to be up and go to class the rest of the day.
13	452	Exactly two weeks after insertion I was very crampy and started bleeding and now have been bleeding for a week straight.
13	453	I felt slightly crampy for about 30 seconds during, and when my doctor said "done", I hadn't even realized she had started the procedure.
13	454	I did have spotting for about a month after it being placed, BUT now we're 4 months in and my period has completely disappeared.
13	455	I went in on the last day of my period, which was Monday, today is now Wednesday and I have some spotting but that's about it.
13	456	I will keep you guys updated on the spotting and how/if my period changes.
13	457	This month, I'm on my 11th day of bleeding - I've been going through panty liners like crazy so I don't ruin my underwear, and it's frustrating having to tell my partner that I'm STILL spotting.
13	458	I bled for about 2 days and now my periods are light and I have noticed the spotting isn’t as bad as it was in the beginning.
13	459	Just wondering how long did everybody else’s spotting or bleeding last for?
13	460	My problem was the spotting.
13	461	I understand this is a normal side effect for many but tell me what the point of birth control is, if you can't have sex because you're continuously spotting?!
13	462	2.5 weeks after it was removed and I'm still spotting off and on!
13	463	My only complaint right now is I have bleed every day since insertion more so then just spotting.
13	464	I started spotting about a week after insertion; for a few months I spotted for a week every other week.
13	465	Since then I’ve been spotting about 90% of all days and it’s hard to predict.
13	466	It’s usually very light spotting that a thin liner or light tampon can handle, but it’s definitely put a damper on my sex life.
13	467	I know that it can take 6 months for your body to adjust, but the spotting hasn’t improved at all since kyleena was inserted.
13	468	Cramps and spotting have started up but it’s all worth it
13	469	I got Kyleena inserted at planned parenthood on October 23rd this is my fourth week on it and I am still spotting regularly.
13	470	About a week later I started spotting and then BAM moderate bleeding.
13	471	I stopped spotting after about 4 months.
13	472	The spotting lasted for about 2 weeks.
13	473	So far I've experienced pretty consistent spotting (can't wait to not HAVE to wear a panty liner everyday)  minor back breakouts, 5 lb weight gain, and it seems that this past month I've had 2 periods- each lasting 6 days (2 days longer than usual).
13	474	I have had spotting every month.
13	475	The first month I only had spotting for 5 days and then the 2nd month I spotted for 17 days and now I’m on my 3rd month and have been spotting for 12 days.
13	476	I had some random spotting for the first couple months and now have not had my period for about two months.
13	477	I had one day of moderate flow and then about 8 days of light (and on some days heavy) spotting.
13	478	I had spotting for two days and then brown discharge for about a week.
13	479	Since then, my periods have virtually stopped with only some very light spotting every couple of months.
13	480	Getting the kyleena put in was super painful; the nurse held my hand though and I only had minor spotting after.
13	481	After the insertion I had mild bleeding then spotting for at least 2 wks, I also had leg pain and lower back pain for 2 wks after, just like the doctor said I would.
13	482	I had light spotting for the first couple of days after insertion.
13	483	I have been spotting dark blood off and on since insertion but I feel hopeful my body will start to regulate itself to the IUD soon.
13	484	Its been a little over a week and I have some small spotting but not a lot, and my sex drive has definitely increased, I am very satisfied with this product so far!
13	485	I have not been on any birth control prior to this and I love not having to take a pill but I have had consistent spotting for just over a month now which is starting to get frustrating.
13	486	I actually had no spotting which seems to be rare and I liked it at first.
13	487	The 1st month was okay didn't have much spotting just for about 3 days and it was light.
13	488	Some brown spotting a week or so before my first period then a light period for about one week.
13	489	Since then I still have A) never had a period, barely spotting.
13	490	The bleeding went to light spotting about two weeks ago, and I had a period -longer, but light.
13	491	Now back to light spotting...
13	492	My period is now over but the spotting has not stopped, its been about 2 or 3 weeks.
13	493	So I just wanted to give my ten cents on the Kyleena IUD....Personally, I think the few weeks/months of spotting are worth the 5 years of nausea-free living, no alarms for pills, and so on.
13	494	Anyways, I've had it for 2 weeks now and there's only one down side on this for me and to the spotting.
13	495	I spot on and off and it makes me sad because I think the spotting is over with lol.
13	496	But other than the constant spotting, I would recommend this birth control.
13	497	Minimal spotting.
13	498	I got my period around my normal cycle time and it lasted 8 days, which is double the normal length, and then some spotting for 7 more days.
13	499	But ever since I experience spotting, very light, only noticeable when wiping but still, I really hope this will stop soon.
13	500	Now only the spotting has to stop and I'm totally happy with this IUD.
13	501	I did have spotting for a few weeks after insertion but nothing a pantiliner can't fix.
13	502	When I first got it that day it was just spotting, now I'm bleeding a lot everyday.
13	503	I spotted consistently for 3 weeks and have had occasional spotting since then, but no periods.
13	504	On about that 54th day of spotting it just stopped.
13	505	No spotting, no bleeding, I still kept on a liner because I was not sure if I should trust what was going on.
13	506	On or about the 90th day I saw spotting again in time for my normal cycle to begin, it was just that spotting, nothing else, I could only see it when I wiped and I only needed to wear a liner This lasted for 3 days.
13	507	I'm sure the spotting has stopped
13	508	I am still spotting non-stop (which is to be expected I'm told for about a month).
13	509	I had a heavy flow than I thought it was spotting in later on in the day it got heavy again.
13	510	I had spotting every day for two months, & still spot two weeks out of every month and any day that I do a strenuous workout.
13	511	I cramped for about a week and bled for about a week but now I have no side effects besides light spotting every now and then.
13	512	It's been 5 months and I've yet to have a period or spotting, which isn't likely but still awesome!
13	513	The spotting went down after the first two weeks and is now only occasional.
13	514	Except the spotting, I love it.
13	515	I have very minimal spotting but only when I wipe.
13	516	I had light spotting for about a month after which was annoying, but that has now stopped.
13	517	If you are a person that experiences bleeding, it is likely you will see some spotting within the first 3 months.
13	518	For people like myself I've been on BC for about 10 years, and I've always had a light menstrual so I knew I wasn't going to have very much spotting after my insertion.
13	519	I have only had very light spotting off and on since I had it placed.
13	520	I agree it was painful and I too have experienced unpredictable spotting for the past 3 weeks.
13	521	I did spot!
13	522	I didn't really spot.
13	523	When I get my period, I continue to spot for weeks.
13	524	I still spot dark blood and small clots every now and then.
13	525	If you are afraid of insertion I’d say take some pain meds and ask for freezing and you will be okay :) so far I’ve spotted on and off since insertion.
13	526	I’ve only spotted twice since early November for less than 30 seconds and the blood was so light you could barely even tell.
13	527	ONE MONTH UPDATE: I spotted for 3 weeks straight ranging in heaviness.
13	528	I also spotted for about 2 1/2 months.
13	529	But my period basically stopped immediately (inserted Day 2 of period) I just spotted and still am a week later.
13	530	I spotted around the time I should have had my period, now nothing.
13	531	My period was light but I spotted for 2 weeks.
13	532	So far I spotted some old blood yesterday but today there has been nothing.
13	533	I spotted on and off for the first month but it's done now.
13	534	I spotted for a day or two but I was on my period when it was inserted, so if anything it seems to have stopped my period.
13	535	Today I spotted but nothing more than a panty liner.
13	536	I spotted for two days.
13	537	I have not had a period since I got it inserted, nor have I spotted since the first week.
13	538	42 yrs old, had kyleena inserted 6/28, pain was not bad during insertion, but the headache and dizziness the three days after were simply horrible.
13	539	I had the IUD inserted on April 19th, and about a week later I started experiencing a chronic headache.
13	540	There is an increase of bleeding/spotting and I do experience headaches but I am told this will pass with time.
13	541	(Weight gain, constant nausea, swollen breasts, headaches) I am 22, and have never had kids.
13	542	I had massive bleeding for a week afterwards, but my headaches have not improved.
13	543	So after having that removed I tried the Kyleena hoping it being a low does option I'd have no migraine issues.
13	544	Have had a constant migraine since 12hrs after it was inserted and am so nauseous.
13	545	I had migraines before medicine but have them just about every period as my hormones increase.
13	546	I'm told this isn't a very common reaction but can happen if you get migraines easily, which I do.
13	547	My new Gyne and I decided  Kyleena was best for my pcos, migraines, and piriformis that flares up during my period (I have post traumatic migraines already, but periods make it worse).
13	548	After being taken off estrogen due to aura migraines, switching to Nexplanon which had WAY too many systemic side effects, Kyleena is a blessing.
13	549	Botox for migraines every 3 months and the migraines I get all the time.
13	550	No reduction in sex drive or weight gain.
13	551	I was on BC pills for about a year and totally lost my sex drive.
13	552	I've already gotten my sex drive back, which I completely lost with the nuva ring.
13	553	Previously I was on the pill: my libido was low, my period was extremely heavy and long, I had a lack of energy, etc.
13	554	My libido has increased significantly, I don't have to think about taking a pill every day, it's super safe, I could go on and on.
13	555	Kyleena is starting to grow on me but the weight gain really bothers me.
13	556	I've not had any problems with weight gain or mood.
13	557	I've had kyleena inserted for only two months and I've experienced a lot of the bad side effects, including fatigue (feeling sleepy constantly and lack energy), weight gain, cravings, anxiety and depression.
13	558	I haven’t weighed myself but I know I have gained weight since insertion and that really upsets me.
13	559	I’ve gained weight while on Kyleena.
13	560	I was on my back with sweats and nausea and trembling for about an hour afterward until I got dragged home.
13	561	I've also had on/off nausea but I've only had it a week so I'm hoping that goes away.
13	562	I did not feel light headed or any nausea after.
13	563	A lot of pain and nausea the first two days and then that subsided.
13	564	The biggest thing was that I got really dizzy and had nausea.
13	565	I have had problems with nausea while taking hormonal birth control (pills and patch), so my doctor told me about Kyleena.
13	566	I became nauseated 1 hr after insertion.
13	567	The first dose made me a tad nauseated, but the second dose was fine.
13	568	After the insertion was completed I was nauseated and lightheaded but I laid back and drank some juice for a couple minutes and I was able to get up and leave.
13	569	I still can barely eat without feeling nauseated and have diarrhea, but I assume it will continue getting better.
13	570	On top of this, I’m nauseous and having diarrhea constantly and am constantly bloated.
13	571	After I did feel lightheaded, nauseous and became sweaty all of which passed in about 10 mins.
13	572	I did feel nauseous after insertion but the doctors were very sweet and let me rest and have juice.
13	573	A week and a half before my 3rd cycle was to begin I woke up feeling nauseous and had vertigo.
13	574	I would definitely recommend this over the pill since I was on the pill for 5 months and it made me extremely nauseous, but Kyleena hasn't made me nauseous at all.
13	575	My period is light but I have really bad sharp pains and I'm bloated and feel nauseous all the time.
13	576	But the second time I was sweating and dizzy and felt like I was going to throw up.
13	577	I bled quite a bit and felt a little dizzy afterward.
13	578	I had a friend drive me in because of all that I was reading about women getting dizzy after the procedure.
13	579	I forgot to eat breakfast but the doctor told me insertion does make people dizzy.
13	580	After it was finally over, maybe a few mins, which felt like an hour, I felt dizzy and sick.
13	581	I went to leave and I almost passed out by the doctors office elevators... just overcome with dizziness!
13	582	No more mood swings anymore due to the lower dose of hormones.
13	583	I am miserable and I have really bad mood swings.
13	584	Why I had it removed: depression, anxiety, mood swings, insomnia, heart palpitations, and lack of motivation.
13	585	I was so nervous to get it in but it wasn't too bad, just breathe and have the nurse hold your hand!
13	586	I was particularly nervous about the pain as a 18 year old after reading others’ bad experiences, but I am on day 4 post insertion and feeling great!
13	587	I was extremely nervous about the pain I had read about that other women experienced during insertion but I hardly had any pain at all.
13	588	I was so nervous I made the doctor tell me everything he was doing while he was doing it.
13	589	27 years old - I  was really nervous to get the Kyleena IUD inserted.
13	590	I just wanted to let any nervous girls know that the procedure was NOT the worst pain ever.
13	591	I was so nervous before, that after I was shaky mostly from a release of my nerves.
13	592	I was extremely nervous about the pain of the placement after reading reviews.
13	593	I was nervous to get it inserted because of reviews I read online but it's different for everyone.
13	594	I was very nervous going into the appointment because of the experiences that I read on here.
13	595	Most people are worried about the insertion, which I was TERRIFIED for, but now I am laughing as I read through these comments because truly the only part that makes it scary, and admittedly made me so nervous before, is reading other peoples "dramatically painful" stories.
13	596	I was very nervous going into the procedure but happily surprised to find out that it did not hurt as much as I thought it would.
13	597	Today I got the IUD, I wasn't nervous before today.
13	598	However, I made the mistake of reading every IUD insertion review and got extremely anxious.
13	599	Hi I just want to say I have ZERO pain tolerance at all (had a LEEP ( loop electrosurgical excision procedure) under general anesthesia) and almost canceled my appointment because of the reviews and how anxious I was.
13	600	I took ibuprofen, misoprostol and adavan (lol) before the procedure because I’d backed out once before because of anxiety.
13	601	The anxiety beforehand ended up being the worst part.
13	602	I took the Cytotec prescribed orally as recommended by the dr, 800mg of Ibuprofen before I went in and a muscle relaxer I had left over to help with the anxiety.
13	603	In fact, my mood and energy levels have improved compared to when I was on the pill, I also don't have sore breasts like I did on the pill.
13	604	I've always been sensitive to Hormonal birth control so I had the copper IUD for 2 years but it moved it out place and cause me constant yeast infections.
14	1	I get nausea, mood swings, stomach pain in the mornings, gained weight, increased acne.
14	2	This pill has done absolute wonders for me in regards to my acne.
14	3	It has completely cleared up what was extremely severe acne.
14	4	First off, my face was very clear (with the one or two pimples here and there) once I started taking Levora my face and back became covered in extremely painful cystic acne caused by the high levels of hormones.
14	5	I've been off Levora for about three months and my acne is completely gone and I'm much happier.
14	6	I also never used to have acne and have some acne problems now.
14	7	I got on them for the purpose of I have extremely heavy periods with horrible cramps and acne.
14	8	They put me on the strongest pill possible after that to try to stop my period from the continuous bleeding, didn't work although I did loose a lot of weight.. for the last year 1/2 I've been sexually active and the strongest pill DIDNT work so they put me back on levora with a seasonal period, and I haven't gotten pregnant and my acne is good and my period is gone!
14	9	And my previously clear skin, which levora ruined with cystic acne, went back to normal.
14	10	My acne has cleared up nicely but have not noticed any change in breast size.
14	11	I went on Levora because I wanted to skip and reduce my heavy periods as well as clear up my hormonal acne.
14	12	At first my acne cleared, but around 6 months later, my acne returned and seems to be worse, some actually cystic.
14	13	I have NEVER had acne before taking this medicine and now my skin is horrible, my sex drive is lower, I've been super sensitive to everything and I cry almost every day about literally nothing.
14	14	I was also constantly breaking out with cyst acne which had never happened before levora.
14	15	My breasts never got any bigger, and I got a bit of acne that I ended up getting medication for.
14	16	Levora also caused me to have acne all the time.
14	17	My acne was cured (moderate acne) now my face is clean I don't get cramping and my headaches are gone :)
14	18	I have not gained any weight due to being on the pill, I NEVER get acne, cravings and PMS symptoms are greatly reduced, and my periods are extremely light and short-almost like spotting.
14	19	My acne still comes and goes.
14	20	I was on accutane for acne last year but this pill has caused all of my acne to come back.
14	21	I mainly use it for acne and so far I like the result.
14	22	Well, I tried Doxycycline a medication specifically for acne but I stopped it immediately due to some horrible experience.
14	23	my acne is gone.
14	24	I took this pill for 4 years and have a really bad cystic acne.
14	25	Well, I had a pretty bad diet and do not exercise so probably it contributes to the cystic acne lesions.
14	26	Now, I can get off Levora without having any problems with cystic acne.
14	27	It was great after that, I did not experience any weight gain or acne issues.
14	28	It wasn't exactly horrible in the area of side affects but it gave me a great amount of acne.
14	29	The acne was not too bad, it was merely extreme small and numerous bumps on my forehead but it looked really bad when I applied make-up as you can see the blemishes and bumps on my head in light.
14	30	It did give me a small smattering of acne and great tenderness in my breasts, but it's very adjusting and my body has gotten the hang of it as the acne has calmed down and the pill has been doing its job of protection.
14	31	I had been on Ortho Tri-Cyclen for 3 years without any problems, but then I started having breakthrough bleeding, and increased skin breakouts including lots of cystic acne.
14	32	Doctor put me on Levora, & after reading a lot of reviews of side effects, I was super worried I'd end up with worse acne.
14	33	Three months later it got worse and I also had problems with water weight, a huge increase in acne, and terrible dry spots all over my face.
14	34	I've gained maybe two pounds and my acne has mostly gone away.
14	35	I started on the patch for my acne, but my skin had allergic reaction to the patch.
14	36	I got really bad body acne.
14	37	Also, I had terrible, painful, oozing acne all over my face ever since about 4th grade, but after a few months of Levora my skin is perfect.
14	38	No substantial acne issues.
14	39	But I have gained weight, become depressed, and I have a LOT of acne, when I used to have a clear face.
14	40	There was a mild increase in my acne but I'm also a college student so I don't particularly lay all the blame on the pill.
14	41	I always wanted to eat, my acne was terrible and I was always crying.
14	42	The crying was from my face breaking out so badly, after like 4 or 5 months into the pill my acne cleared up and the cravings went away, my face has been clear ever since!
14	43	I've never had acne, but I have noticed that my skin had cleared up.
14	44	I have had much lighter periods since I have been on Levora, no cramping and no acne but the positives really don't outway the negatives.
14	45	Yes, it was a successful birth control because I never got pregnant, but I developed acne for the first time in my life (I'm 21).
14	46	The acne could not be contributed to anything else - I'm a healthy and active vegetarian with an esthetician for a mother.
14	47	I didn't have acne before and didn't have any after.
14	48	I also have increased acne by very, very little, nothing that makes me complain or feel annoyed.
14	49	I have not become pregnant, I've had lighter, shorter periods, no acne (but this was never a problem for me) and only minimal weight gain.
14	50	The clinician said it would help my acne, but it hasn't really changed yet.
14	51	Before I had breakouts all of the time, and only a few days after starting this, I noticed that my acne had close to disappeared.
14	52	As for any issues, I haven't faced any at this point (acne is about the same, no increased weight or appetite, etc.
14	53	I did have some acne at first but that went away...it was no worse than my face breaking out around my period.
14	54	Levora seems to keep my acne in check.
14	55	My weight hasn't changed neither has my acne, and even though it is a little pill it sticks and is hard to swallow sometimes.
14	56	I haven't gotten pregnant, my sex drive has increased and my acne isn't as bad.
14	57	My acne has decreased.
14	58	I would recommend Levora if it is for lighter periods or for acne issues.
14	59	I don't know if it's affecting my acne.
14	60	I also started breaking out more frequently.
14	61	May have made me get more pimples than usual but nothing horrible, no bad breakouts, etc.
14	62	As far as Acne, it is not nearly as bad as far as huge zits I got when I was not on birth control, but I still get them, just not as big, and as bad.
14	63	Sure I had cramps but they were just normal compared to what I was used to.
14	64	Try out some and see what works for you- keeps you regular and keeps the cramps away
14	65	It helps me a lot with cramps and the level of heaviness in my period, which was why Levora was recommended to me.
14	66	I started taking this bc to help with my cramps and heavy period, very bad choice because I have literally been bleeding for 6 months!
14	67	Most of the time it was spotting, some days it was so heavy and the cramps... they are the worst.
14	68	I had break through bleeding and severe cramps for over 3 months of heavy bleeding.
14	69	My cramps were ten times worse than when I wasn't on the pill.
14	70	It made my periods lighter and my cramps very minor, which is great.
14	71	I get terrible cramps and even my parents noticed that my moods are inconsistent and that my depression seems to have worsened.
14	72	However, my periods are lighter on Leverage but I do get worse cramps.
14	73	I still get cramps during the first day of my period, but they're so slight and Advil takes care of it immediately.
14	74	My period used to come and go as it pleased sometimes staying with me 2 full weeks out of every month, alone with raging mood swings, and severe cramps.
14	75	The first two months were horrible my body hasnt taken BC in 5 years so my stomach always felt light cramping and I did have spotting and my emotions were everywhere the third month my cramps only came the first day of my period but the best was I only bleed for 4 days and the light for 2 and I can count on my period not coming 2 weeks!
14	76	Before I would throw up and have horrible cramps.
14	77	Sometimes, my cramps would be so bad I would want to call into work.
14	78	I do have slight cramps near the time of my period but it only lasts for a second or two then disappears.
14	79	Even without the pill I've always had a fairly regular cycle and my cramps have been manageable with Aleve.
14	80	With Levora, my period is the same length but it's lighter, and the cramps are lighter.
14	81	I have experienced no weight gain and the only cramps I get are the day before my period, and the pain there is mild.
14	82	No weight gain, no cramps, very little mood swings(but that can be said for all, including men) my period lasts about three days and they are extremely light- to the point it can go unnoticed.
14	83	I also don't experience cramps, when I used to have throughout my entire period.
14	84	I used to spend two weeks out of the month with bad cramps and other PMS symptoms.
14	85	However, periods were short with no cramps or spotting and I never got pregnant.
14	86	My period went from 8 to 4 days which was good and my cramps did lessen.
14	87	), and has GREATLY helped me with my cramps!
14	88	I'm also having major muscle cramps, but I had that with the other pills too.
14	89	Not only that but I feel sharp stomach cramps.
14	90	I've been using this pill for a year and my periods/ cramping couldn't be better.
14	91	Painful cramping.
14	92	Period cramping is not nearly as bad as before taking the pill.
14	93	I have been taking this medicine for almost 2 years now due to horrible cramping.
14	94	No medicine worked for my cramping and I was taking to much medicine.
14	95	So I think the pill does help to prevent pregnancy very well and it does indeed help with my cramping even though I may have to take a pain pill a few times.
14	96	I also have alot of cramping on my period, which I thought birth control was supposed to decrease.
14	97	It made me so crampy, stopped getting periods at the end of the month and got them at weird random times, nauseous and severe headaches.
14	98	I took it for 11 months and had to stop due to sudden spotting once a week.
14	99	I get spotting at least every week for three days.
14	100	Then I've had random spotting (dark brown) for about 2-3 weeks.
14	101	No spotting, no mood swings, no weight gain!
14	102	I can take the pill a few hours late and it's totally fine (my previous pills would case spotting if I took it even an hour late).
14	103	I have skipped my periods thus far (so, twice) and have had no issues with spotting.
14	104	I haven't had my period in almost 2 months with no spotting.
14	105	I almost always start the same evening and the period lasts 3 days, with 1-2 more days spotting.
14	106	My only issue is with spotting and breakthrough bleeding.
14	107	I have had no side effects at all, not even spotting.
14	108	Shortly after, I started experiencing terrible headaches and nausea, despite taking it with a meal.
14	109	The first phase was headaches (which I never get normally!
14	110	I haven't had any of the headaches or mood swings.
14	111	No headaches, no nausea, no feeling physically weak or overly emotional.
14	112	I've had issues before with other pills (Microgestrin, Aviane, Kariva)...you name it... breakthrough bleeding, depression, headaches, low drive, etc.
14	113	I stopped getting headaches the week before my period too.
14	114	I have never had a migraine until this pill.
14	115	I began Levora to help control my migraines that are caused by a significant drop in estrogen on or right before my period.
14	116	Although they worked for the migraines, I started to notice symptoms like extreme moodiness, crying, frustration, etc within the first month but figured my body was just getting used to it since this is the first birth control I've been on.
14	117	Didn't have migraines, depression or anything of the other symptoms/side effects.
14	118	Messed up my hormones too much, luckily it didn't change my sex drive but it caused me to just sit there and cry or do nothing.
14	119	I had great sex drive as well.
14	120	I also have low sex drive and difficulty staying wet.
14	121	While I had the implant a had constant dark discharge, had depression, very low sex drive, not being able to get wet, and weight gain ( and I am an extremely active person).
14	122	I feel my sex drive is coming back and my discharge is completely back to normal.
14	123	But man, was it KILLING my sex drive!
14	124	I have gained weight that is seemingly impossibly to lose and my sex drive is so low for a teenager.
14	125	My sex drive has decreased.
14	126	I read on here that it affects your sex drive.
14	127	Now after 5 months i began losing my sex drive i couldnt get wet at all even if i was wanting sex.
14	128	Non cyclical breast pain, decreased sex drive, difficulty losing weight, discharge.
14	129	My skin has not cleared up and my sex drive is gone.
14	130	I lost about 10 lbs in the month and a half (about) since getting off levora and my sex drive is back.
14	131	Sex drive remains high (lol its important)
14	132	I feel like my sex drive has stayed the same.
14	133	My sex drive has stayed the same.
14	134	Not once have I noticed any issues except for a slight decrease in my sex drive.
14	135	I've had no side-effects besides EXTREMELY low sex drive.
14	136	I've never had a particularly high sex drive but now it's nonexistent.
14	137	I did break out just a bit and my sex drive increased.
14	138	This time my sex drive is lower and I tend to get dry during sex more often.
14	139	My breasts have definitely gotten bigger, and my sex drive has increased, never have I had a problem with dryness, etc.
14	140	My sex drive is normal, my periods are so much lighter/shorter, but my mood swings are terrible.
14	141	Also my decreased sex drive has become a huge problem.
14	142	I also had no sex drive, which was my first major red flag that something serious was out of whack.
14	143	My sex drive is gone almost and my poor boyfriend has been there through all of it.
14	144	I absolutely hate how much this has affected my sex drive, it's caused me to gain 10lbs, and sometimes I get overly emotional/depressed.
14	145	Other than that I have to agree with most of the other reviews on this page that my sex drive has decreased significantly and I have become overly emotional.
14	146	Sex drive is higher than ever, this might be because I feel more protected and so does my partner, but we still use condoms as a second birth control method.
14	147	I have lost all sex drive.
14	148	But what HAS dramatically increased is my sex drive.
14	149	My sex drive is still healthy.
14	150	It does work as far as not getting pregnant however my experience at first was it didn't make a huge difference then 6 or 7 months into it my sex drive went down, along with being very very dry, my moodiness increased drastically.
14	151	The only problem I have is my sex drive is pretty much non-existent.
14	152	I have noticed a major increase in my sex drive, wetness and all around interest in sex.
14	153	Sex drive has also definitely increased.
14	154	My sex drive has increased.
14	155	My appetite stayed low and my sex drive was better than without the pill.
14	156	I have a very decreased sex drive.
14	157	Well, after a couple months I've experienced longer periods, a depleted sex drive and a harder to reach climax.
14	158	Most despressingly, my sex drive has all but disappeared.
14	159	This pill does decrease my sex drive however.
14	160	Overall, it does it's job but I would caution potential takers with low libido.
14	161	My libido is really high and my breasts have gotten a little bigger.
14	162	However, like most other people my libido DECREASED to the point that I have absolutely no desire.
14	163	My two biggest issues were a VERY decreased libido (almost non-existent), breast tenderness, and anxiety.
14	164	No significant weight gain or loss.
14	165	Once I noticed my weight gain I had to make healthier choices and definitely work out.
14	166	I experience very little, if any side effects on this pill, and it immediately started to reverse the chaos the other pill had caused my body (weight gain, bloating and severe mood swings).
14	167	I experienced some mild weight gain, but not so much that it really matters.
14	168	Weight gain wise I did pack a lot of pounds when I first taking it.
14	169	At first I had a slight weight gain and extreme breast tenderness.
14	170	No mood swings, hardly nauseous, light period, no weight gain or loss, it's been perfect.
14	171	My main concern was weight gain and mood swings.
14	172	No weight gain.
14	173	I was so freaked out when I got this birth control because I saw all of these horrible reviews, depression, weight gain etc.
14	174	Still, I am very unhappy about the weight gain.
14	175	Acne is unchanged and normal for me as a 17 y/o (which is why I also believe that this pill works tremendously better for me than other women); weight gain was minimal, only about 5 pounds, but my weight fluctuates usually between 120 and 130 now, whereas before the pill, fluctuation was between 116 and 120.
14	176	I have had no mood swings, weight gain, or decrease in sexual drive or wetness.
14	177	Lower sex drive/don't self-lubricate and I've gained about 50 pounds (although part of that could be bad diet; haven't changed my diet though).
14	178	It has definitely kept me from getting pregnant and shortened my periods by days but I've gained at least fifteen pounds and I have gotten insanely emotional.
14	179	I developed extreme depression, anxiety, and mood swings, and gained 15lbs.
14	180	My skin got greasy, mostly on my face and scalp, I gained a lot of weight I'm still trying to lose, made me feel nauseas and it messed up my liver.
14	181	I also gained 10 pounds in the 3.5 months I've been taking it.
14	182	My face has cleared up completely, my periods are lighter and shorter then they used to be, and I haven't gained any weight.
14	183	I've been taking this birth control for 6 months and have gained almost 20 pounds (I'm at 143).
14	184	I have gained so much weight and I have the worse moods.
14	185	I have gained about 15 pounds from this med and I always feel bloated.
14	186	The following two months I gained a significant amount of weight (10 pounds) even with running and dieting.
14	187	My only complaint- each time I've gone on and off the pill, I've gained a couple pounds.
14	188	I had bad PMS episodes and that's when I gained weight.
14	189	I gained 20 lbs almost right away, but my pants still fit, so it's not a major problem for me.
14	190	I have always weighed in at 100 pounds but after two months on Levora I gained 20 pounds and have stayed that way since.
14	191	During this time I have gained 30 lbs.
14	192	I have perfectly clear skin, light periods and have not gained a pound.
14	193	In the first couple of weeks I gained weight, then in the last two I lost weight.
14	194	Before the pill, I used to be 125 pounds, now, seven months in, I've gained about 20 pounds that I can't for the life of me, get rid of.
14	195	Also I have had increased food cravings, I feel like I am always hungry and combined with feeling depressed that is a dangerous combination, I've gained about 30 lbs in 6 months.
14	196	and I gained weight on this pill, quickly.
14	197	Since starting this pill I have gained 12 pounds.
14	198	The weird food cravings have gone down significantly, although I have gained about 4.5 pounds.
14	199	The first time I went on this pill I gained 8 pounds in a month than I went off of it for a few months lost All the weight.
14	200	Second time I went on I gained 9 pounds.
14	201	I have only gained about 5 pounds.
14	202	When I came off of it over this last year I gained about 50 pounds but in that time frame I also had a knee surgery so my activity dropped drastically from normal.
14	203	Since starting Levora 3 months ago, I've had severe panic attacks, fatigue, nausea, and awful mood swings.
14	204	They would give me anti nausea pills and antibiotics to "control the pain and nausea", not get rid of it.
14	205	Dealt with mood swings and nausea the first week or so, but went away.
14	206	I don't have any more nausea or moody swings.
14	207	Here is my experience: the first day I took it I woke up around 3 am because I had a lot of nausea but it got better later.
14	208	The next two days I had nausea but nothing I couldn't handle.
14	209	I've only started my second month of Levora, but the nausea is so bad that I'm going back to Lutera.
14	210	Granted, after that first week, it worked great for me by reducing my cramps/flow (as well as regulating my period--my original reason for trying Levora), but after beginning again after the placebo week, the nausea came back in force.
14	211	As one who is a weenie when it comes to nausea, I will certainly not be taking it again!
14	212	With this pill I don't have issues of breakthrough bleeding or nausea as I had with others.
14	213	I felt nauseated all day, I wanted to quit there then but I am honestly glad I did not.
14	214	Even though I took the pill at night I would wake up with morning sickness where I could not eat and everything would make me nauseous.
14	215	I also get paranoid because days after intimacy I get nauseous and side effects of pregnancy.
14	216	I strongly recommend to not take this med if you typically feel nauseous a lot or if you have terrible periods like me.
14	217	I also notice that the morning after taking the first pill of each pack I feel a bit nauseous when waking up, but it goes away within a few minutes (which is normal when taking anything with hormones).
14	218	The first week of taking the pill I felt very nauseous.
14	219	I have also been constantly nauseous.
14	220	Thinking of food makes me nauseous, but I'm also starving and feel like I can't eat enough!
14	221	I had to force myself to eat, and I was nauseous.
14	222	I would also get nauseous late at night.
14	223	Since I took the pill in the evening, I rarely ever felt nauseous.
14	224	So maybe the medication is altering my system %u2026I do feel nauseous and I crave like crazy.
14	225	However, I have developed some emotional mood swings.
14	226	No mood swings.
14	227	I began having severe mood swings and was so depressed i didnt want to be alive,and i got the ovary pains so bad i went to the emergency room and they just said it was nothing.The day i turned 18 is the day i got off.I immediately felt better and i even had a little sex drive.4 months off doing FAM birthcontrol still going strong.
14	228	The first couple days I couldn't stop crying...I am NOT the crying type of person, and I had constant mood swings.
14	229	I haven't had issues with mood swings or anything.
14	230	Levora did not make me gain any weight, or cause mood swings.
14	231	The first two months were a bit erratic with mood swings, but have since balanced significantly.
14	232	I was on Othro Cyclen Lo and it gave me horrible mood swings, only problem with this birth control was when I first started it I did throw up alot for no reason but I have been on it for 6 months and I love it, but I am switching to the Nuvaring because I can't remember to take the pill.
14	233	But I have mood swings like I've never had before, I get anxious and/or depressed.
14	234	Three months in and I'm an anxious, angry, depressed, lunatic with high blood pressure I can feel raging through my body and causing the sensation of heart palpitations daily.
14	235	And no bad side effects ever that I have noticed, but am worried and anxious for whenever I choose to stop it what could happen to my body after so many years of non stop use.
14	236	My moodiness is just so unpredictable now I feel physically depressed and anxious.
14	237	This pill made me extremely emotional and anxious.
14	238	The anxiety is overwhelming which causes hostility and depression.
14	239	I have had anxiety and being on this pill has made it worse, way worse and it has made me become depressed.
14	240	I started having anxiety and boughts of depression.
14	241	I switched to another type of bc and within 2 months my suicidal thoughts were completely gone and within 4 months my depression and anxiety were gone too.
14	242	I already have issues with anxiety and depression and this has made is worse.
14	243	That has now shifted to hot flashes with lightheadedness followed by anxiety and LOTS of crying!
14	244	I'm depressed and have lots of anxiety.
14	245	Although it did prevent pregnancy and help to regulate my periods, I have experienced horrible depression, anxiety, and a major increase in appetite.
14	246	I'm still suffering from anxiety issues, so I'm not sure if the pill contributed to the anxiety, or if I would've started having it even if I never started taking the pill.
14	247	I recently started taking Levora again, but I quickly remembered why I stopped taking it before, HORRIBLE breast tenderness and swelling, to the point where I'm constantly thinking about how bad my breasts hurt, it's hard to concentrate or move or do anything because they're always hurting, just wondering if anyone else experienced this and if so, if it goes away at some point?
14	248	I have no severe side effects except tender breasts sometimes.
14	249	The only side effect I have is sore breasts.
14	250	), breasts sore beyond belief, and exhaustion.
14	251	I have had 4 yeast infections... ew.
14	252	I am constantly having yeast infections and when I get turned on I can barely get wet like I use to normally before I took this pill no matter how horny I am.
15	1	Hello, I been having liletta for 7 months now I had no trouble at all everything was perfect normal periods every months no pain , but recently I started to notice a lot of painful acne on my back shoulders and neck I would like to know if this has happened to one of y’all too please help  .
15	2	So far I had an excessive acne recently and noticing weight gain and my breast gotten huge.
15	3	I haven’t experienced acne or weight gain I’ve actually have lost 60 lbs after only having it for 5 months now.
15	4	I've had a little acne and I am down 14 pounds.
15	5	2 weeks after my period came on it's lasting for about 10 days so far..I just want my period to go away!and I'm acne prone so I'm guessing this has made it worse other than this..I like it!
15	6	The con is that I experienced frequent painful headaches, cramping before my periods (which is new to me), painful sex from sharp ovary pain and dryness, low libido, acne, weight gain, and serious bloating.
15	7	Got horrible acne I still cannot get rid off.
15	8	Holy moly the acne!
15	9	If you are acne prone, I would think twice.
15	10	The first 6 months was radical mood swings, acne, weight gain and cramping that gradually stabilized.
15	11	I haven't had weight gain or acne but I am super emotional now.
15	12	I had been struggling with acne breakouts prior to getting the IUD and the breakouts have definitely subsided.
15	13	(Cramps are the worst part by far) At about 2.5 weeks after insertion, I began to feel some mood swings and had acne breakout.
15	14	The cystic acne I reported on day 3 (see earlier review) has subsided and was explained as androgens flooding my system.
15	15	Day three has delivered me terrible acne.
15	16	My breasts aren't tender because of the hormones, no mood swings, no acne.
15	17	More body acne but it's manageable.
15	18	Although it's effective, I almost got it removed in the first couple of months because of side effects: crazy mood swings, cramps, bloating, cravings, acne all over, spotting.
15	19	I gained 40lbs while eating better and being more active, got awful body acne, lost hair, and have had bad constant headaches, which I have never had.
15	20	I am also experiencing oily skin with acne (first time in my life) along with lower back pain, mild hair loss, 2 months of consistent bleeding or spotting.
15	21	My hair is falling out, bloated all of the time, I had to start a pill to stop the constant bleeding, SHORT temper,major depression, I have little control over my emotions now, cramping, acne, Ive been losing bits of bloody skin, weight gain and my anxiety has gotten 10x worse.
15	22	I got the iud inserted May 2016 since then the acne has been horrible, cramping off and on all month.
15	23	I didn't bleed that hard after insertion and have had a period every month but more recently I have been getting HORRIBLE random cramps with slight spotting, terrible back pain, headaches, having a terrible time losing the baby weight (she's 7 months old... Only lost 8 pounds), worse acne then I had in highschool, fatigued, and extreme mood swings.
15	24	Not to mention the acne and cramping.
15	25	Extreme bloating,  disgusting acne,  and weight gain.
15	26	No acne - at all.
15	27	Getting frustrated with the a spotting, but my Dr. says its normal and in having more acne than normal.
15	28	I did not read up on it at all before hand because I didn't want to chicken out and not get it, and now I have read up on it and I'm seriously hoping I did not make a big mistake I don't need any more weight gain or acne or longer periods.
15	29	The only things I hate is  the weight gain and acne I've always had some acne but now my skin is super oily so its gotten a bit worse.
15	30	I also am experiencing alot of acne.
15	31	I've had cramping the first week which went away but now I have a low sex drive, acne and weight gain.
15	32	She also said progestin based birth control can make acne worse.
15	33	Cons:  I'm very frustrated this month because I've developed cystic acne along my left jaw and cheek and forehead and i can't lose weight whereas before I could
15	34	I have had a constant light period, acne on my forehead (which I never have had) and weight gain..
15	35	I'm also noticing a lot of acne (my skin has been always clear before Liletta was inserted).
15	36	I have light cramping everyday and breast tenderness here and there just like acne.
15	37	Never in my life have I had such horrible acne.
15	38	If this acne doesn't go away in the next couple of months, I'm going to have the IUD removed.
15	39	My acne has not changed; I still break out around the time of my period.
15	40	I have also develop moderate to severe cystic acne (i had clear skin before) the acne is all down my chest, chack, forehead and dotted across my face.
15	41	The dermatologist prescribed an antibiotic, I have been on it a week and the acne has gotten worse.
15	42	The contraception benefit doesn't seem worth the acne and associated self esteem issues.Considering having it removed...
15	43	Anyone else had severe acne side effects?
15	44	I initially had acne but read about black african soap which (in conjunction with tea tree oil after showering) has eliminated it.
15	45	Got this IUD inserted February 2016 it's now July, still bleeding, very bad diarrhea, cramps, acne, weight gain, anxiety, and probably the WORST and most often migraines I've ever experienced in my life-like every other day I have bad headaches.
15	46	First 3 months = heavy bleeding & acne.
15	47	No acne, my moods even seemed to improve.
15	48	By the end of February, I was having bad cramps and acne.
15	49	Also a bit of acne which is very annoying.
15	50	I will say, I have been breaking out, and that's unusual for me.
15	51	My sex drive diminished, I have been breaking out everything, back, neck, chest, and face -oh and shoulders.
15	52	I'm having headaches and breaking out.
15	53	I had a group of pimples that didn't go away for a long time.
15	54	Reasons I'm happy with Liletta - doesn't make me moody or sad like the pill did, no breakouts other than what I had before which is 1-2 hormonal pimples per month, and can't feel it.
15	55	The insertion was probably the most uncomfortable part because I have scarring on my cervix so putting the IUD in was more difficult but it felt like bad cramps that would come and go but once it was in I felt fine, only thing I don’t love is the on and off spotting I had normal periods but now it’s more spotting pretty randomly so I try be prepared constantly which has made sex a little more stressful because I’m always worried there will be blood, and I’ve had nipple tenderness that last about a week plus, but it’s a good birth control.
15	56	It stopped my period + I never had cramps.
15	57	But I didn't experience any pain at all when they put it in I didn't even get the cramps afterwards.
15	58	After insertion I had slight cramps and a little bleeding for a few days.
15	59	Two cramps through the whole process and it was over.
15	60	The cramps weren't too bad the last one was worse then the other but nothing too insane.
15	61	I didn't even bleed or have many cramps afterwards the next day I went on doing my same old stuff not even realizing it is there.
15	62	I have had it since October 2016 and I had no problems no period until about 6months ago it has caused major cramps, I now have insomnia, and just feel horrible...
15	63	I’m tired of these horrible cramps without a period...
15	64	I have no period and still have major cramps... Pros: I’m not pregnant (so it did it’s job); no period...
15	65	Insertion was pretty painful and the worst of the cramps lasted about 6 hours afterwards, so I would probably get it on a day you can lay at home with a heating pad.
15	66	The cramps are making it hard for me to want to keep the IUD though.
15	67	Pre-IUD, on the first day of my period I'd get cramps so horrible I'd be nauseous and couldn't eat anything.
15	68	Well, immediately after IUD insertion I started having similar severe cramps that have yet to go away and nothing has given me relief.
15	69	The first week I had cramps, now I have them occasionally.
15	70	And the cramps after inserting and for the next couple of days were excruciating.
15	71	After 2 days my cramps did stop and I felt okay.
15	72	Only symptom I have from it now is pretty painful cramps but it’s nothing a painkiller can’t relieve.
15	73	I chose Liletta over Paragard this time because I've always been a heavy bleeder with heavy cramps so when the doctor told me this would help both of those that was another plus and so I went with Liletta.
15	74	I haven't had any abdominal cramps but my back pain is excruciating!
15	75	Anyway my only problem with this is I basically bled from the time I got it inserted ,somedays heavy other day’s spotting with cramps that I have never had before (and i have never had kids) till my next period.
15	76	It was after that period that all cramps and spotting stopped.
15	77	So far so good I think I am supposed to be having my period now but I'm barely even spotting I just have mild cramps.
15	78	I haven't had cramps but for the first 4 months I had continuous bleeding.
15	79	I had slight cramps, headaches, and a appetite that was through the roof for about 2 days.
15	80	My issues are I have cramps from hell that come out of nowhere and bleeding that won't stop!!!
15	81	I have terrible cramps and major mood swings.
15	82	The cramps, low back pain, discomfort and pain jumped from one ovary to the next made me miserable for about 4-5 days.
15	83	The insertion was painful, but bearable, the cramps that came after were basically labor (contractions) pain!
15	84	I had sex then like 4 days later I started my cycle and it's day 8 with heavy bleeding and horrible cramps...
15	85	I had the Liletta for 8 months and for the whole 8 months I was constantly taking pretty strong prescription pain medication because the cramps were so bad that I would be falling to the ground at work
15	86	Putting it in was bad, but the cramps seemed to go away after a week.
15	87	Dr office said cramps were normal.
15	88	I had occasional cramps for weeks that would hurt a lot but not unbearable.
15	89	I still have occasional cramps during my period but not bad at all
15	90	I had no pain whatsoever nor cramps.
15	91	I was bed ridden the next couple of days with horrible cramps.
15	92	The cramps became manageable after about a week but I still had to take ibuprofen every day.
15	93	I'm looking forward to the time when I will be cramps and spotting-free and enjoy it for a few years, and then I will probably go back on the pill.
15	94	First, the insertion was incredibly painful for me followed by excruciating cramps.
15	95	I do get leg cramps every time I have a period now though.
15	96	Because I had my period when  I got my liletta inserted cramping and pain was normal for me..but afterwards spotting is still there and I have mild cramps and back pain.
15	97	I was kneeling over in pain with horrible cramps.
15	98	I have random cramps and back pains.
15	99	I have had the Mirena put in me twice just because it's only for 5 years after the second one I only had it in for 2yrs but because I wanted to have my 3rd baby @ first I did bleed for 3 months on & off also had cramps but after that it went all good never had any side effects at all plus I didn't get periods now my baby is 5 months & on July 14,2017 I got the Liletta hopefully I don't have issues the process wasn't that bad at all nor did I get cramps I stop bleeding the next day so let's see what happens crossing my fingers
15	100	Days following, cramps began to develop every day and light bleeding followed.
15	101	Light bleeding (only had to use light tampons) was consistent and cramps got worse and occurred every day.
15	102	After insertion, I had cramps that were more like contractions for a few hours, then they slowly calmed down, and I felt kind of uncomfortable for a couple days.
15	103	I felt cramps as my doctors deployed the liletta but only for a few minutes.
15	104	Even after my body accepted it I still felt cramps when I worked, cleaned , or sat down.
15	105	Taking for heavy periods -Pain from beginning - three weeks constant- cramps and stomach nausea, now an infection fever, stomach sharp pain and weight gain, hair loss, weight gain already!
15	106	Then right before my period I would get sharp cramps that lasted a day then normal cramps and pain.
15	107	Since  having it my period comes and last 17-20 days and will be heavy then if we have sex I begin spotting and have severe cramps even pain in certain areas.
15	108	I have horrible cramps that feel like light labor pains.
15	109	I did spot and bleed for about an hour after I had it done minimal cramps tho.
15	110	Started cramping about 20 minutes later, but nothing nearly as bad as my worst menstrual cramps.
15	111	Then mild cramps and low back soreness for a day.
15	112	Just a couple cramps and it was over.
15	113	Stopped having a period after three months, and the weird cramps I kept feeling stopped around 5 months.
15	114	I have spotted every single day since I got it which I hate because I don't like sleeping wearing panties sometimes but have to wear a pad 24/7 now and bad uterine cramps.
15	115	I know I will get my period because there is about 1 day of irrational crankiness, followed by another day of cramps, which are sharper than ever before.
15	116	I didn't experience bad cramps or anything like other users have described.
15	117	I had cramps for weeks straight.
15	118	Like a mix between losing your virginity plus the worst cramps you could imagine.
15	119	Really painful cramps lasted 2 days after insertion  and then milder ones on and off for the first week, especially when I worked out.
15	120	I had some cramps and felt really worn out yesterday but no spotting, & feel completely normal today!
15	121	I took extra strength ibuprofen, the cramps were more an annoyance than anything else.
15	122	Side note: I had sex today (with a condom) & it was definitely enjoyable on both ends, no weirdness w/strings- I honestly think it helped my cramps subside.
15	123	Once my Dr. was done I had mild cramps for about 15-20mins.
15	124	But nothing major no where close to period cramps.
15	125	Day1: moderate cramps like usual light bleeding.
15	126	Day3: slight discomfort no cramps.
15	127	I feel some cramps (not too bad) and some spotting.
15	128	I will update with how it affects my period or if cramps continue because this is just day 1
15	129	I get cramps everyday but nothing I can't handle.
15	130	Very minimal cramping aside from  the early cramps due to insertion.
15	131	Very bad cramps for 5 to 6 hours..
15	132	Think of if you've ever had to go home from school because of bad cramps in your teens.
15	133	Slight cramps are very rare.
15	134	I had painful cramps for one hour that day only.
15	135	After that, it was similar to my normal cramps for 2 days.
15	136	For about an hour after I had horrible cramps, but then I had period-like cramps for the rest of the day.
15	137	After insertion that day I had terrible cramps.
15	138	I have not had any cramps or discomfort all evening with very minor spotting.
15	139	I got out the doctor and felt super light headed and the cramps were terrible I had to sleep for the rest of the day my cramps literally lasted 3 days.
15	140	The insertion was a little painful with some cramps following the procedure.
15	141	I have awful cramps and lower back pain to the point that I'm actually crying writing this.
15	142	For those ladies who get bad cramps during menstruation, the cramping I experienced was maybe half as bad as some of my worst cramps.
15	143	I took ibuprofen since I had terrible cramps, discomfort and pain for two days.
15	144	I had a few cramps for 2 days but nothing unmanageable.
15	145	I have been spotting ever since (only a week) but no pain or cramps.
15	146	The cramps I'm having now are so INTENSE and nothing seems to alleviate them - not Advil or a heating pad.
15	147	Horrible cramps and weakness the next few days.
15	148	My cramps seem to be worse in the evening, I guess because I keep myself occupied during the day with work.
15	149	These god forsaken cramps put me on my knees wishing for death.
15	150	The cramps are NOT normal period cramps, this was intense 8.2 pain cramps that 1200mg of Advil barely helped!
15	151	The insertion hurt for about 10 seconds and then I just felt cramps a bit heavier than my period.
15	152	I got liletta inserted January 11 it's now January 17th and everything is fine , the only thing I've noticed is I'm starting to break out on my face which is not like me, the insertion itself was not bad I've never had kids or anything the only part that really hurt was the measuring of the cervix a 8/10 pain but it was only for 2 seconds, other than that I got up right away and went right back to work afterwards cramps weren't any worse than usual and were only for a day or two and a little bit of back pain.
15	153	I don't normally have bad cramps on my period, but holy cow these cramps had me on the floor, on the couch, on the bed curled up in a ball...
15	154	No cramps or bloating!
15	155	Insertion was bad but nothing I couldn't handle since I was used to awful cramps.
15	156	The awful cramps lasted for 4 days.
15	157	The cramps are not something that I can withstand for a long period of time so I've made ibuprofen and my heating pad my best friend.
15	158	I never had an issue with cramps before, but from day 1 on this IUD I had unbearable cramps.
15	159	My back pain, abdominal cramps and upper thigh pain disappeared.
15	160	I have painful cramps now and I didn't before insertion.
15	161	Not to mention the never ending cramps!
15	162	I got Liletta placed in 2 days ago and while the insertion process wasn't comfortable at all, I only had cramps the day of insertion and haven't had any since.
15	163	It was definitely uncomfortable but it was just mostly cramps and I have a very low tolerance for pain.
15	164	I've had pretty intense cramps off and on everyday.
15	165	I went to my doctor because the cramps were so bad I thought something was seriously wrong.
15	166	I got it inserted in December 2015, I spotted for about a week with minor cramps.
15	167	I had horrible cramps for about 2 hours afterwards and was swore the next day.
15	168	I had pretty bad cramps for about five days afterwards along with my normal period.
15	169	didnt hurt a bit just became very dizzy after insertion and needed to sit dow, felt cramps but ibuprofen helped to eliminate that, had some bleeding yesterday, today just some brown spotting.
15	170	I feel like my lower pelvis is a little inflamed or something is in there, but maybe its the cramps...
15	171	No cramps.
15	172	So far, mild to bad cramps that went away with a hot bath and ibprofin.
15	173	The procedure was a little uncomfortable with very mild cramps but nothing I couldn't handle, I actually thought it was going to be worse based on reviews.
15	174	Had bad cramps for couple weeks off and on.
15	175	My cramps lasted the entire time I had it in and I had painful intercourse as well.
15	176	For the first month I bled constantly with heavy clots, terrible cramps, and tender breasts.
15	177	I have had spotting and cramps on and off 3 weeks after insertion.
15	178	I get painful cramps at any time of the month, sex drive ebbs and flows like crazy, my periods last up to 2 weeks, lot of spotting after sex, awful skin/acne, the list goes on.
15	179	Feels like every time I eat I get intense cramps.
15	180	There were some risidual cramps, first light then really bad on the drive home.
15	181	Tiny cramps, but I think it was only from having my cervix dilated, kind of a residual pain.
15	182	& My cramps hurt so bad I had to call into work one day.
15	183	I've had it for 5 weeks nows, I bled heavy with clots and terrible cramps starting right after insertion for nearly 3 weeks.
15	184	I've been lightly bleeding since the procedure and have had severe cramps.
15	185	The cramps were horrible for an hour after the insertion.
15	186	Since insertion, maybe two light spells of cramps.
15	187	I had excruciating cramps the rest of the day which I medicated with Aleve and a heating pad.
15	188	No spotting, no cramps, no headaches etc.
15	189	I had bad cramps the first two days after and had to stay at home with a heating pad.
15	190	I have cramps everyday now for about an hr or 2 and even when the flow darkens I get cramps and back to bright red blood.
15	191	It wasn't normal cramps, more like a intense shooting pain.
15	192	When getting it inserted it only felt like a strong period cramp for less then a minute.
15	193	I was worried that I wouldn't be able to do my fav positions because some say they cramp, but I haven't experienced any cramping at all!
15	194	Yes it hurts, yes you cramp but it's nothing unbearable.
15	195	I got it in fall of 2016, the insertion was the same as mirena, it feels like a bad cramp probably lasted about 5-10 min no nausea or problems the past year,  occasionally I will feel it during sex depending on the position Hubby and I are in but we just switch positions.
15	196	I did feel a slight pinch a couple times that felt like a cramp but honestly I barely noticed it.
15	197	Imagine a period cramp, except instead of being dull and spread across your lower abdomen, it's concentrated to one exact spot.
15	198	If I cramp there is sure to be bleeding or I will pass small pieces of tissue.
15	199	Broke out into a cold sweat during the procedure & took a solid hour to feel normal again, but the worst of it was 1) measuring the uterus and 2) the cramping in the ~10 minutes immediately after insertion.
15	200	Took 660mg naproxen for the cramping, it promptly went away and has not returned.
15	201	I was on my last few days of my period and I had no cramping after the procedure and my period basically stopped immediately.
15	202	The next day I barely had cramping and was back to normal.
15	203	For me it was painless the whole procedure was like 10 mins and the Dr kept saying you'll feel a pinch, I didn't feel it then she said you'll feel some cramping , I didn't feel that either.
15	204	If my husband and I have intercourse you can bet there will be heavy bleeding and cramping after.
15	205	My Dr. had me cough during insertion which distracted me, BUT I realize the 4-6 ibuprofen I took before getting it made me feel less pain because when the meds wore off ...dear gawd...the discomfort and cramping was unbearable.
15	206	A little cramping and spotting the first few days.
15	207	But no cramping since.
15	208	The insertion was very painful and I did have cramping for a few days afterward.
15	209	After a few hours, some ibuprofen, and a heating pad the cramping is finally bearable.
15	210	The next few days there was some cramping.
15	211	The first couple months kinda sucked as my body adjusted....random spotting, cramping, periods although much lighter lasting 8-9 days, After the first few months it was great!
15	212	The cramping was still there though and my boyfriend said he could feel the strings during sex (but that's the Dr fault who put it in didn't cut them short enough I guess).
15	213	I was not expecting much pain (since I am used to severe cramping) and I read others' reviews, but getting it inserted was the worst pain of my life-- I screamed in the dr's office--and it felt unbearable.
15	214	I do get random cramping and low back pain before my period starts, but it’s manageable.
15	215	The beginning of my second week the cramping began to feel like someone was stabbing me in the uterus.
15	216	My cramping was excruciating the first 2-3 days but settled afterwards.
15	217	No cramping and insertion was painless.
15	218	I only had cramping for like 20 minutes after and it was just in my legs.
15	219	Week 2 was okay occasional cramping here and there.
15	220	The whole process was over in about 5 minutes and I just had some minor cramping for the rest of the night.
15	221	It didn't hurt so much as just some cramping for like 2ish minutes and then a little achy for the hours after insertion.
15	222	That said, besides cramping, I've had zero side effects so far with lilletta.
15	223	I just finished having a period that lasted 12 days only to start cramping and spotting on Day 18 again!!!
15	224	I have had mild cramping that I never got before birth control.
15	225	As expected, the procedure was uncomfortable and caused some cramping that lasted for the day.
15	226	I had cramping for about 24 hours, and also had a bit of leg pain which I thought was odd, but that too subsided within 24 hours.
15	227	Haven't had a period since (7 months), no cramping, no crazy breakouts or weight gain or anything like that.
15	228	There has been some seemingly random cramping that I went back to the Dr. To check out, but everything is fine, I'm well on my way to no periods, period!
15	229	The insertion was painful and I did have light cramping for the next three days or so but nothing I couldn't handle.
15	230	I had some very mild cramping for a couple days but nothing worse than during my monthly cycle.
15	231	My boyfriend had to drive me home because the cramping and pain in my cervix was so excruciating.
15	232	For the first two days, I had severe cramping but no bleeding.
15	233	I constantly have mild cramping, pain with sex, and made me break out like crazy.
15	234	I'm getting this taken out on Thursday due to the painful cramping everyday.
15	235	Had  mine put in June 15, 2017 the insertion was a bit painful I had it put in two days before my period which made my period off 17 days so I was scared I was pregnant, finally get my period three days ago cramping is kind of bad but I had the copper IUD before this one so I'm used to it but my periods are much lighter then with the copper IUDI mean I only need a liner which is nice so this is my first.
15	236	Over that very long month I have had the worst cramping that I have never experienced in my life.
15	237	I have terrible cramping the whole time my period is here.
15	238	The process was quick with minor dizziness and cramping right after, but a little relaxation and ibuprofen handled that.
15	239	I had moderate/mild cramping for about 6 hours after.
15	240	Now I can say I have a cramping spell once a day, it's rather annoying.
15	241	She explained what she was doing every step of the way and the only pain I felt was some moderate cramping when she clamped my cervix.
15	242	The insertion was painful but was very quick and the cramping subsided with ibuprofen, I have now been on it for about a year and a half and had some issues.
15	243	I got the Liletta 3/13/17 insertion was as explained some discomfort and cramping I was advised to take ibuprofen before my appointment which I did.
15	244	It's interesting to me to hear some people had the worst pain in their life while others had just a few hours of cramping.
15	245	I get more cramping then bleeding.
15	246	I had no cramping and bleeding stopped overnight.
15	247	After this, I experienced mild cramping but it has subsided as the day  has gone by.
15	248	After a week with horrible cramping and bleeding I went back in for a recheck.
15	249	And so far, I've had no cramping.
15	250	I usually get really bad heavy periods but the day after insertion my period went straight to spotting and minor cramping.
15	251	I had cramping days later as expected but weeks later I am still having cramping.
15	252	I didn't really get any cramping afterwards either.
15	253	I had a lot of cramping afterward for several days and I felt light headed after the procedure (eat something before, take 800 mg of ibuprofen & stay hydrated!)
15	254	It's been about 10 hours since the insertion and I still have mild cramping.
15	255	The next periods where shorter but I did experienced more cramping and spotting every now and then.
15	256	The cramping died down at day 5 it's random now, the bleeding is down to spotting.
15	257	There was mild cramping and an awkward feeling because having something in your uterus is not something you normally feel.
15	258	I have had worse cramping during my period and the cramping from prep and insertion went away almost instantly.
15	259	Despite all of the pain and intense cramping, I'm hopeful that it'll be better than the pill.
15	260	I had a lot of cramping and uterine spasms yesterday after it was put in.
15	261	Today being the 2nd with this IUD I have had intermittent cramping.
15	262	My cramping is nothing that ibuprofen doesn't help.
15	263	I have been on this medication for almost a year and the cramping that comes with this birth control is absolutely the worst.
15	264	I figured after a few weeks the cramping would die down but it didn't.
15	265	Spotting and cramping after the procedure that Vicodin didn't help at all!
15	266	I was told to expect moderate cramping for about 3 days as my body adjusts and light bleeding for 3-6 months.
15	267	I have had slight cramping and hardly any spotting so hopefully everything goes well
15	268	After was serious cramping like I've never had before.
15	269	The cramping was INTENSE.
15	270	I'm cramping a tiny bit and spotting but it's fine.
15	271	Nothing crazy at all, and no cramping.
15	272	The misopristol caused some light cramping but that was it.
15	273	I have some cramping and light bleeding now but I feel pretty good.
15	274	I'm cramping a bit now, bleeding steadily.
15	275	I've been cramping, bleeding and passing blood clots since it was inserted.
15	276	I received Liletta June 2016, slight cramping at the beginning,  and a period that would last a couple weeks a month.
15	277	Had it replaced, it's only been a couple weeks of constant light cramping,  my period is now on and I think it shifted again and is close to coming out for a second time.
15	278	I experienced a little cramping and slight headache.
15	279	I am experiencing light cramping and bleeding.
15	280	Had some intense cramping for the first few hours been taking 800 mg. Ibuprofen every few hours.
15	281	Light spotting and cramping the day after.
15	282	I had cramping the day I got it but it was gone the next morning.
15	283	Some to not much little cramping at all.
15	284	I've had some light cramping and back pain, but I'd much rather have that once than to take a pill every day.
15	285	I got iud  lilletta inserted in may2016..and I'm getting it remove next week ..i only got one heavy menstrual cycle in July my cramping is bad everyday headaches..I have gained weight I also got some skin blemish on face..and to top it off itchy irritation on my vagina..
15	286	I had severe cramping for about an hour after insertion and slight bleeding over a couple days.
15	287	No more cramping.
15	288	it only felt like a pinch and I was cramping for like 20 min afterwards and that's it.
15	289	I'll take spotting and slight cramping throughout the month than what I was going through with pill anyday.
15	290	Also had cramping yest but today I have breast tenderness,nausea,and a migraine!
15	291	After the cramping I didn't stop bleeding until maybe April!
15	292	The both of us have had bleeding, on/off cramping and stomach pain (moderate to awful), ever since.
15	293	The insertion pain and after cramping is just too much!!
15	294	The first day the cramping was moderate but was gone by the next day.
15	295	My biggest complaint was the moderate daily cramping that I took care of with Motrin and a heating pad, however, since I got my first period with the IUD the cramping has subsided.
15	296	So far I'm enjoying the iud and hopefully the cramping and spotting go away soon!
15	297	I'm loving it so far, experienced some cramping the 1 st day but not since then.
15	298	Until last week, I've started cramping and spotting REALLY dark blood.
15	299	I planned on working the next day but had to stay home due to bad cramping....on par with a very bad period.
15	300	The cramping subsided over the next few days ( I went on a long run on day 3) but skinny jeans bothered me a bit.
15	301	I got liletta inserted in August 2016 a lot of discomfort at first than I bled for 3 weeks afterwards thinking about getting it removed due to periods 2 to 3 times a month or when having intercourse I start bleeding my periods are more crampy and make me sick to my stomach plus been having a bloody discharge everyday.
15	302	You will feel a little light headed & crampy after but no joke, ice cream or a milkshake will help the pain!
15	303	I was crampy and had some oozeing/spotting the rest of day.
15	304	I was crampy on the drive back to work but worked the rest of the day with some motrin and no issues.
15	305	It was a little crampy when they were measuring but other than that my experience was nothing like these horror stories.
15	306	I felt super crampy the rest of the night but woke up the next morning feeling normal.
15	307	Now I'm on my period and I will admit it is heavy but less crampy.
15	308	The procedure was crampy, though I did take 600mg of ibuprofen beforehand so it was bearable as long as I remembered to breathe through it.
15	309	Fast forward 3 months, using panty liners EVERY DAY due to constant spotting.
15	310	It wasn't even bright fresh pink/red spotting.
15	311	It looked like old dried period blood spotting.
15	312	Some spotting yesterday & today, but was able to go about normal activities that same night.
15	313	After insertion, I had irregular spotting for a month or so.
15	314	Today is only the second day I've had it, and the light bleeding I had has been reduced to very slight brown spotting.
15	315	I’ve been spotting ever since I got it inserted and I can’t wait for the spotting to stop.
15	316	Omgggg when will the spotting stop!
15	317	I am also spotting and truly haven't had any desire to have sex with my boyfriend because I've been in so much pain.
15	318	Things got better but spotting since Oct 25 and weird smell.
15	319	I stopped spotting after 2 weeks and haven't had any limitations intimately or fitness-wise!
15	320	I got the liletta placed in August 2017 I have experienced spotting after intercourse and my periods which only lasts a couple days.
15	321	I haven't been spotting either.
15	322	I had a few days of spotting after insertion, but then I was back to normal.
15	323	I still get my period but it's very light and I experience spotting a few days before my period and a few days after.
15	324	I have not had any spotting or any other side effects yet.
15	325	I have been spotting since insertion, but it keeps getting lighter and lighter.
15	326	Now I am spotting every day which is really annoying.
15	327	Cons: Constant spotting still to this day, no sex drive, can feel it every now and then, and my boyfriend can feel it but has gotten used to it.
15	328	I will be taking mine out as my boyfriend has realized how annoying the spotting is.
15	329	Can't wear any cute underwear because you never know when the spotting will start up and not having a sex drive is a killer.
15	330	The first 2 months were frustrating because I had heavy spotting and heavy periods, but then my 3rd month was a little better, and my 4th month, I didn't have spotting or a period, and it's been great since.
15	331	Had very little spotting mostly with wiping.
15	332	Periods went away, I'll get moody or have occasional cramps/back pain every few months I'm assuming for my period but that's it, I started spotting once a few months ago at night barely anything , but no bleeding
15	333	I have different symptoms before my cycle (which is just spotting for a couple days) but I will have a dull achy back pain, stomach and intestines have started to burn, and I feel major flutters in my lower abdomen for about a week before it starts.
15	334	I have had spotting on and off since then, but very very light.
15	335	My first period after getting the IUD lasted for a little over 3 weeks and would switch between spotting and heavy bleeding.
15	336	I started spotting on the seventh and on the 8th I was still spotting.
15	337	I've had it for about a month now and I haven't stopped spotting or bleeding since I got it.
15	338	It was heavy spotting for the first 2 months, and the past month its been flowing like a river.
15	339	I had my period for the first month straight, and then regular/heavy spotting till April.
15	340	Very mild spotting for about 48 hours after insertion.
15	341	, swelling in face  - only good thing is that I am able to sleep after pain med and am only spotting  -I will be getting this out -
15	342	Spotting for a few day then a light flow in the middle and finished spotting.
15	343	I then haven't experienced a heavy period, just spotting and light bleeding.
15	344	Bleeding heavily for a week after it being put in, after that I've been spotting ever since.
15	345	I have been spotting EVERY SINGLE DAY since then!!
15	346	But no crazy spotting or pain.
15	347	I went in the middle of my period (usually 5 days) and within a day of Insertion my period turned into 2 weeks of spotting.
15	348	It's been about 3 weeks now and I have been spotting every single day which is really annoying, but I am a lot less worried about pregnancy and pretty much everything about my life is normal.
15	349	When I got it in initially I bled for about 3 months straight and sometimes still experience random prolonged spotting.
15	350	I started spotting for a few days (expected) and then a period which felt like 2wks and I've been spotting every since.
15	351	The spotting is light but it's annoying for obvious reasons thinking if getting it removed next week.
15	352	Day2: spotting slight discomfort .
15	353	So i just had my daughter 1-25-17 and I got this 6 weeks after having her mind you I was still having some bleeding after having my daughter I had 2 weeks after having her then I had my period then I had spotting and now after having this put in 3-17-17.
15	354	The initial pain was bearable, and after a few days of spotting, it was over.
15	355	After that I had a couple days of spotting each month and now, about 3 months later, I have no period at all.
15	356	It's going on 2 weeks and I'm still spotting.
15	357	Cramping and spotting lasted a few days after...and for the first 4 months I spotted lightly for 8-10 days, always 28 days apart...so I tracked those times as my period.
15	358	Period immediately disappeared, to extremely light spotting and then left all together after having it only 2 days (usually 5).
15	359	Periods are now 3 months in between, only lasting 1 day of light spotting.
15	360	When I first got it my periods was light and had spotting here and there.
15	361	I spotted for the first 4 days just enough for a panty liner, not even a pad, and have not had any spotting since.
15	362	I'm not sure what other people experience months after the insertion, but I had my Liletta inserted in mid November and I have bled or have had spotting every day since insertion.
15	363	I was on my period during the insertion and it actually stopped the next day and I've had minimal spotting since and was told that would last up to 6 weeks, but it's really been maybe two full days since the procedure.
15	364	After that my period continue as usual although I had following spotting for two weeks.
15	365	I have had spotting and was not in my period during insertion.
15	366	The next 2-3 days was spotting brown and weird colors, I don't know.
15	367	I am not experiencing heavy bleeding or spotting.
15	368	Only negatives I've had are random spotting which I've had on previous birth controls as well.
15	369	My first 2 experiences with birth control were with the pill,  I was on the 3 month kind for around a year, and after the first cycle I had constant spotting, and on my final scheduled period before changing I bled so bad I passed out .
15	370	Well it has now been about 18 days since insertion and the spotting comes and goes as it pleases and I'm cranky some days.
15	371	Some days I don't bleed at all other days its bright red spotting other days its like a Brown color spotting.
15	372	I Totally hate the spotting.
15	373	2 weeks of daily, consistent spotting.
15	374	It starts out as brown spotting for about 4 days and then bright red bleeding for 4 days and back to brown spotting for another 4-6 days.
15	375	I did also have spotting the day of and that has gone as well.
15	376	I had heavy spotting until the middle of last week when it finally lightened up!
15	377	I'm experiencing light spotting throughout the day and it's very annoying.
15	378	I've been spotting since then and it's making me kind of annoyed.
15	379	Besides that it's fine and I'm hoping the benefits will be worth the annoying amount of spotting.
15	380	too soon to tell, hopefully the spotting will stop soon and periods all together.
15	381	My periods are very light now basically spotting, but they last longer.
15	382	I had the Liletta inserted on the 7th of July (exactly a month ago) - The insertion was fantastic, I literally felt nothing (I previously had SKYLA- that was agony when inserted) Since the insertion I have had a fairly heavy period and have had non stop bright red, clotted spotting.
15	383	I have felt a bit bloated here and there and iv been spotting since.... ill update in a bout a month to see how its going.
15	384	but so far so good just waiting on the spotting to stop.
15	385	After that I have had random spotting but not period.
15	386	I like liletta and if you can tough if out that first month of a wacky long period and little spotting I would definitely try it.
15	387	I did not have any spotting or anything like that.
15	388	Things started to improve around the second month with only light bleeding and now I have random spotting or a period that lasts a few days.
15	389	The longer I have Liletta, the longer my periods are, however they are lighter (heavy spotting).
15	390	Since yesterday, I've only experienced mild cramping/light spotting
15	391	I was on the last day of my period, and still spotting.
15	392	I had Liletta inserted while on my period and did not have any extra spotting besides what I normally experience.
15	393	The first couple weeks I only had maybe 2 spotting episodes that lasted a day or so.
15	394	Now I'm finally spotting, with no bleeding in the evening or overnight.
15	395	Ever since I got it I have been spotting.
15	396	The spotting is very random.
15	397	I keep getting spotting on n off since insertion but I'd take that over the bleeds.
15	398	no bad headaches and light spotting.
15	399	Then when I had intercourse for the first time since having it inserted everything was fine until we were in a certain position and I let you the most blood curtailing scream, I have no idea what happened with the IUD but I'm 100 percent sure he must have put pressure on it in a certain way it pinched inside of me so bad i have to say it ruined the moment.ive have light spotting ever since the insertion.
15	400	I stopped bleeding after two days & I spot very little.
15	401	The only bad thing about it is that I spot more often between periods and it can be annoying.
15	402	Took a 800mg ibuprofen an hour before insertion on 2nd day of period (I always spot on first day) insertion didn't hurt it felt like a pap smear.
15	403	I also spot almost every single day.
15	404	For the first 3 months I had a cycle, but after that I may spot here and there.
15	405	I spotted for a couple days and that was it.
15	406	It was okay when I first got it, not too painful or maybe I was expecting more pain, anyway I spotted for a day afterwards and it was fine, then no bleeding for a week.
15	407	I only spotted with wiping the first 2 weeks then it stopped completely all together.
15	408	I spotted for a couple hours after insertion but not to bad.
15	409	I spotted after it got put in and I've been bleeding ever since.
15	410	I also bled moderately for the week after, then spotted daily the second week.
15	411	So far no bleeding, I spotted the day of the insertion but that was it.
15	412	Also, I just got what was supposed to be my period, but only spotted for 10 days, no regular period ever came.
15	413	Have spotted just a little.
15	414	I spotted for a few days and I'm fine 3 days later.
15	415	The pain was non-stop and I finally decided to have it removed last month after experiencing stabbing pains on the left side of my head, followed by a dull headache that would last 24-48 hours.
15	416	Loss of sex drive, mass increase in anxiety and sleep problems, nervousness, headaches, constantly tired, it would hurt randomly.
15	417	Pros: No weight gain, stopped periods Cons: daily headaches, chronic yeast infections (11 months!
15	418	For the first few months I had headaches every other day.
15	419	I had the copper IUD which gave me headaches and hurt like heck.
15	420	Liletta does not give me headaches and I don't feel it at all.
15	421	Mood is great, no headaches, no anxiety and no weight gain and we can't feel it.
15	422	I'm 19 (no kids) and I got this inserted because regular birth control pills were giving me extremely unhealthy side effects like black out migraines where my vision would blur.
15	423	), diagnosed w/chronic migraines, severe anxiety, panic attacks, and brain fog so severe for over a month that Drs thought I was having seizures in my sleep/tumor/MS/etc.
15	424	And my migraines have cut down over half of what I normally get I don't know if its the liletta or not but its nice not to have migraines every day (been dealing with them for 10 years) So there's an update on my liletta experiance.
15	425	My sex drive increased at first, but seems about normal now.
15	426	Zero sex drive, depression.
15	427	I'm a year in now though and I'm finding it hard to work off the weight, I'm still very emotional, my skin is bad (possibly unrelated but my eczema has come back), low sex drive.
15	428	I lost my sex drive and now I very seldom have the urge to have sex or to be touched.
15	429	I also had awful anxiety and no sex drive.
15	430	If anything, I lost weight and increased my sex drive.
15	431	Hot flashes , back pain, mood swings, fatigue ,chest pain, very low sex drive and minor depression .
15	432	My sex drive has increased since having it.
15	433	My sex drive actually increase with being on it.
15	434	My sex drive us non existent.
15	435	Sex drive - increased.
15	436	Heres the great my sex drive has went up ALOT lol and I have lost about 5 lbs.
15	437	My sex drive has gone up.
15	438	prior to Liletta I had Depo for 1 year which caused minimal almost to nonexistent sex drive.
15	439	So switching to IUD didnt make much of a difference as far as the periods but I dont have the eating anxiety and my sex drive is back on and poppin.
15	440	No weight gain, no anxiety, normal libido.
15	441	I don’t like the weight gain at all and if it continues I might get it removed.
15	442	The initial issue was bleeding for about a week but other problems in the long run for me are the mood swings, feeling deep depression, and the slight weight gain.
15	443	I've always struggled with weight gain W/hormones.
15	444	Then I tried the paragard, no weight gain, but excruciating pain every day for the year I had it in (suspecting an allergy), then I tried nexplanon, thinking it was less hormones, lots of people like it.
15	445	It has also caused weight gain.
15	446	My side effects do include weight gain and a struggle to lose it despite consistent exercise and healthy eating, and dry skin, and bloating/constipation.
15	447	No weight gain or breakouts.
15	448	I've been to a hormone specialist now (1k later in costs) to get blood drawn only to find out all of above and the 14lb weight gain (I'm now 144lb) is all bc of this device.
15	449	I am tall and somewhat petite (typically 127lbs at 5'9, weight gain was 27lbs during pregnancy) and I have noticed that I am actually gaining back the weight I lost after baby with this birth control.
15	450	No weight gain or skin problems.
15	451	On top of the extreme weight gain, my skin looks like I'm going through puberty.
15	452	No weight gain.
15	453	I don't really know about the weight gain but if I can't lose weight starting my diet on Monday I will let everyone know.
15	454	I think my weight gain is from the IUD but not 100% sure.
15	455	I haven't had any bad side effects and also no weight gain!
15	456	No weight gain (but I did experience bloating).
15	457	However, no weight gain for me.
15	458	I had horrific breast tenderness, moodiness, some bloating but no real weight gain.
15	459	I have had NO weight gain, food cravings, or nausea.
15	460	In one year, I've gained 15 lbs, have worse anxiety and depression and my skin is terrible.
15	461	I have gained at least 10 pounds.
15	462	Also I’ve gained 4 pounds since I got it (three weeks ago).
15	463	I have gained weight from it, and I get twinges of pain in my ovaries from time to time, but I believe that it only occurs when I am supposed to get my period.
15	464	I have gained 24 lbs in the past year but am more active then I have been in years- I walk more and move around not just sit around and drive all the time.
15	465	I have finally stopped bleeding, loss all the weight I gained (12lbs).
15	466	I've have no problems with Liletta at all, it stopped my period immediately, I've gained no weight, and have had no pregnancies!
15	467	I gained 13 lbs... after just 3 weeks.
15	468	On the depo, I gained 30 pounds in 3 months.
15	469	I have gained the 20 back.
15	470	I've gained 10 - 12 pounds despite months of a very clean diet, counting calories, and frequent exercise.
15	471	Everything was going good, but I've noticed that I've gained so much weight even while on a diet and working out daily I've gained 30-40lbs while on it and I can not seem to lose any of it!
15	472	I should be keeping weight off however I have gained 13lbs since getting Liletta.
15	473	The duration of my having the liletta, I gained weight and kept it on, super difficult to lose it!
15	474	I have gained almost 30 lbs.
15	475	And I've ALWAYS gained on BC w/estrogen.
15	476	By February I noticed I gained 10 lbs and I had been eating very healthy and working out.
15	477	I went to my Dr. who recommended the Liletta saying "it's the same thing"  Seconds after insertion I was extremely nauseated and in incredible pain, cramping/bleeding immediately and had the shakes for roughly 2 hours.
15	478	I have also been very nauseous and could barely eat anything.
15	479	I was nauseous and dizzy for half an hour after.
15	480	I was nauseous and light headed.
15	481	I was dizzy, weak and in a lot of pain.
15	482	I did get dizzy but was able to stand up, walk and drive home afterwards.
15	483	Side effects: cramping/pain, mood swings, back pain, vaginal infection...which I just found out after a month of having this thing in I have BV.
15	484	(I’ve been trying) I don’t feel any hormonal mood swings that I would count as out of the ordinary.
15	485	I feel bloated and I have major mood swings.
15	486	I also experience mood swings and I have never been so emotionally sensitive in my life.
15	487	Before getting my period I get extremely depressed, my mood swings are terrible.
15	488	I was taking the pill for about a year, but felt like I didn't like the mood swings or remembering to take it.
15	489	No mood swings at all compared to pill.
15	490	I've been having mood swings and hot/cold sweats.
15	491	The only possible negative may be mood swings, but I've always had an attitude.
15	492	Benefits: I don't get crazy mood swings like I used to on the pill and I don't have a lot of hair growth on my body it seems like my hair doesn't grow as fast.
15	493	Cons so far- mood swings.
15	494	My mood swings were crazy, but I could deal with that.
15	495	My doctor has liletta and so does most of the people in the office so she very understanding why I was nervous.
15	496	I was nervous about my decision to have an IUD vs the birth control I have been on for 10+ yrs.
15	497	After reading the reviews I was nervous but went through with it.
15	498	I was pretty nervous and anticipated the pain to be close to labor pains.
15	499	Was very nervous for the insertion but it was all a breeze.
15	500	I was nervous for no reason.
15	501	I was nervous to get it put in because I have a low pain tolerance and it did hurt a lot for about a minute when they were positioning it.
15	502	I was really nervous after reading some reviews, so I wanted to share mine since mine is more positive than others.
15	503	I was nervous after reading all the reviews - but honestly - it was nothing.
15	504	I'm still very nervous about using it without a condom, but so far it's been a decent experience!
15	505	No anxiety, panic attacks, brain fog, nothing.
15	506	With depo my periods were nonexistent and eating anxiety.
15	507	I never knew what breast tenderness felt like, and I'm not of fan of it.
16	1	Now with this pill I get the most severe, cystic acne all over my face.
16	2	I guess you can say this pill is effective because due to the cramps, nausea, mood swings, acne, and constant bleeding, you will definitely never get pregnant because you will not be having any intercourse.
16	3	Originally I was on a pill for my acne but I needed to switch to a pill that was a stronger form of contraception.
16	4	Another thing was my acne.
16	5	My acne came back full swing and now I am 22 looking like I have the skin of a 7th grader.
16	6	I didn't notice any changes in my weigh or mood while taking lolo, but I do think it made my acne worse - for the first time I've had cystic acne while on lolo.
16	7	My acne was popping up more frequently, I experienced some severe depression, and I gained excessive weight and for a fitness competitor that’s the exact opposite of what I needed.
16	8	My acne is horrible now.
16	9	I have endometriosis and acne prone skin.
16	10	Any acne I used to have is completely clearing out and no new ones are popping back up.
16	11	My acne hasn’t got worse or better.
16	12	I wish I found a pill that rids my acne and doesn’t affect my weight or sex drive..
16	13	Depression/anxiety, mood swings, headaches, acne, WEIGHT GAIN (like 30 lbs in 5 months), cramping, bloating, forgetfulness...and way more.
16	14	When it stopped everything was great no acne no anything, I got my period the same month on the last white pill and it ended on the last brown pill.
16	15	I've been taking it a little over 6 months now - no weight gain, no acne, no mood changes, no loss of libido, AND my periods are so light now, mostly spotting, no cramps and a shorter duration!
16	16	My acne has gone unphased.
16	17	I have been on this pill for about 4 months and so far it has made me extremely moody and have terrible acne.
16	18	I am 22 and only ever had bad acne when I was an athlete, after that I never had acne.
16	19	Ever since I started this pill my acne is not controllable.
16	20	I am now finishing up my 2nd month and am being stopping this because I ended up having episodes of depression again, heavier spotting (had to wear a tampon), and got acne (in addition to the 1st month side effects).
16	21	My acne became really horrible!
16	22	I had never had cystic acne in my life.
16	23	Broke out in really bad acne (five pimples on my face) within a week of taking it (I normally have very clear skin).
16	24	I didn't experience any change in my acne though, as it is a possible side effect of this particular birth control.
16	25	Other than that I felt absolutely no different, and while I'm sad it didn't help my skin at all, I'm starting to think that moderate acne is pretty small in comparison to all the negative side effects I have on my new pill.
16	26	Bad cystic acne (never had acne before this in my life) on my forehead and horrible mood swings.
16	27	This is the second birth control I have been on and it didn't effect my acne (didn't improve it or make it worse).
16	28	Being on the pill eliminated my period to light spotting every other month, got rid of acne, no other side effects.
16	29	And so far the only problem with this one is the acne.
16	30	I have always had mild acne growing up but it eventually went away.
16	31	I've noticed since starting my first pack the acne has started coming back.
16	32	I was on this pill to make my periods lighter and clear up my acne.
16	33	For acne it did wonders, but ONLY when taken with the antibiotic minocycline, together.
16	34	Both medications on their own did not effect my acne, but when taken together they helped tremendously.
16	35	No weight gain, no acne, no mood swings or nausea.
16	36	My skin is completely clear of acne and I feel like I don't break out as easily as I used to.
16	37	During the first few weeks, I had breakouts everywhere, cystic acne and all of that good stuff.
16	38	Took it for about a month or a little less.. made me moody, break out when my acne hadn't broken out in over a year.
16	39	Only downside is I did get some acne, but the acne may be just due to something else since I've dealt with breakouts prior to trying lolo.
16	40	I've only been on it for a little over two weeks, and my typically clear face is now covered in cystic acne that nothing seems to get rid of.
16	41	I do think my boobs got bigger from it and I have some mild acne but who knows if it's from the pill or not.
16	42	It is Day 14 and my breasts are completely tender, I have acne on my face, chest, neck and back.
16	43	Compared to my old pill, Levora, a lot of those side effects have gone away like my hormonal cystic acne that covered my back and face.
16	44	My experience with Lo Loestrin has been great except for one thing: acne.
16	45	Not to mention the spotting, weight gain, acne, and contact lens problem.
16	46	I'm almost 2 months into taking it, but within the first  week, lymph nodes in my face painfully swelled up under my skin.They eventually went down, but that was only within a week of taking it, later, I had acne in places I have NEVER had it and cysts under my skin.Keep in mind I have never had a problem with acne in my life, 90% of the time prior to this pill my skin was almost completely clear.I had irregular bleeding in the middle of the pack after NOT getting it when I was supposed to (during the sugar pills), I checked the scale yesterday and I gained 8 pounds so far, and my mood swings are insane.
16	47	I have horrible acne now that I didn't have before, on my face and my chest.
16	48	My acne did clear up and now my skin is just as clear as before, if not better.
16	49	I was extremely hesitant to try any sort of hormonal contraceptives because of my history struggling with severe acne and my miserable experience with accutane.
16	50	No initial breakout or acne, which was my main concern.
16	51	My breasts slightly increased in size, but no weight gain or acne.
16	52	LoLo made my clear skin break out in cystic acne, made me have little sex drive, made me lose a tremendous amount of hair, and totally messed up my periods and made me spot throughout the whole month.
16	53	I've always had issues with acne, but this pill didn't make it any better or worse.
16	54	I also, noticed more migraines and more acne.
16	55	But overall the pill works well also I have notice I swear a lot more than ever in my life and I do get acne more often!
16	56	Although, after being on it for several months, I have re occurring consistent UTI's at least one every two months, Acne on my back (I have NEVER had acne), horrible mood swings, significant hair loss, lack of energy, headaches, suicide thoughts and horrible anxiety.
16	57	It was originally prescribed to me to clear up my acne and I love it!
16	58	It has helped tremendously with facial acne.
16	59	Good pill to try if you are having problems with heavy cycles and/or acne.
16	60	Cleared up my acne, made my boobs a full cup size bigger, no weight gain, increased libido, no issues with mood swings.
16	61	I originally went on to control heavy periods, acne and immobilizing cramps.
16	62	I started taking lolo when I was 12 due to acne and a cyst I had, and I had the worst experience longer periods, bloating, and increased acne and nasty brown discharge with cramps more painful than any cramps I've ever felt.
16	63	My doctor prescribed it for birth control, heavy periods and cystic acne.
16	64	The acne disappeared within the first month of use and I have not have a period (by choice) since I started using it 15 months ago.
16	65	I have cystic acne and it drastically improved within a week.
16	66	My acne never changed.
16	67	I didn't gain weight, I didn't get acne, and I didn't have emotional issues.
16	68	I liked it a lot because I had zero acne.
16	69	I love this birth control, I feel great on it and haven't gained any weight or got acne from it.
16	70	I highly recommend it, especially if you're petite or susceptible to nausea, acne, and other side effects associated with higher dose pills.
16	71	I'm bloated, I hate everyone, I'm tired no matter how much sleep I get, my acne is terrible, and my mind is muddled.
16	72	Lost my appetite and got acne in places I've never had it before, like my back and chest.
16	73	The worst thing for me is the cystic acne this pill has caused me.
16	74	I get cystic acne around my period that lasts forever, which I have never had before.
16	75	I've had unbearable breast tenderness throughout my whole experience and my acne has only gotten worse after starting this pill and one of the main reasons for starting it was to clear acne.
16	76	I haven't had any issues with temperament, weight gain or loss, acne, etc.
16	77	It does take more than a couples of months to help the acne.
16	78	I started to take this drug to not get pregnant and for my acne.
16	79	No acne.
16	80	I have suffered with adult acne since I was in my early 20s.
16	81	He sad it will help with pain and acne.
16	82	However, as soon as I started taking it my face broke out in cystic acne the worst ever.
16	83	I have been taking this medication for about a week now and my main purpose for it was to regulate and lighten my periods as well as help with acne.
16	84	I've been on it for almost a year now (was put on for heavy/painful periods and acne) and it solved all of my menstrual problems!
16	85	my acne has cleared, I haven't had mood swings/weight gain etc!
16	86	So many side effects with that - moody/depressed/tired, acne, headaches, bloating, etc.
16	87	I essentially bled/spotted for those 9 months, gained weight & had severe back acne, I'm surprised I held out that long.
16	88	I didn't experience any abnormal weight gain, and it didn't affect my acne whatsoever (neither lightened it nor made it heavier).
16	89	Previously I had pretty severe acne, which nothing could help, but after 2 months my skin is completely clear.
16	90	Since I wasn't looking for it for birth control purposes, I was mainly focusing on acne, the duration and pain of my periods, and weight changes.
16	91	I noticed also that my acne got worse.
16	92	Overall I think as a first time birth control user, it's been an ok experience but if you're looking for acne solutions, maybe try something else.
16	93	My sex drive hasn't been affected in the slightest, I'm very, VERY big on taking care of my face and skin and I haven't had any acne, pimples, etc... Go for it!!!
16	94	I was expecting to get acne for the first little bit because thats what my body normally does when i start a new vitamin or med but there was no problem.
16	95	Besides that,  this pill has been reliable and didn't change my weight,  sex drive,  or give me acne.
16	96	Didn't experience any weight gain and it did not help with my acne.
16	97	I've gotten clumps of cystic acne all along my chin, neck, and cheeks.
16	98	Within the first week, I experienced the most horrible cystic acne break out of my life.
16	99	The progesterin in this pill is androgen based, which is found to increase acne.
16	100	I also had a little acne.
16	101	I never experience weight gain, acne, spotting nothing.
16	102	He said i should try it since i have been having acne problems since i gave birth.
16	103	My acne has cleared up wonderfully.
16	104	Also my acne on my face has never been worse.
16	105	I never break out when NOT on birth control and all of the sudden while on this I have severe acne.
16	106	My weight was not effected and my acne actually cleared up.
16	107	It's coming out in chunks and I shed a lot throughout the day.Since, my skin is prone to cystic acne that's what's appearing on my face and back.
16	108	Along with the weight gain I also suffered from horrible sporadic cramps and really bad acne.
16	109	My breast felt very tender in the beginning and my acne cleared up and my nails became very strong/healthy as well.
16	110	I haven't gained any weight, no acne breakouts and I haven't had a period in 2 years.
16	111	But now on lolo I've had crazy acne and just got my period a week early, and its the most painful cramps I've ever had.
16	112	After stopping the acne eased up, now treating scars and remnant marks on face that may take months, acne persists and skin is definitely in worse condition than before starting BC.
16	113	I gained a lot of weight and got the worst acne I've ever had in my life (never even had acne like that as a teenager).
16	114	Generic gave me terrible anxiety, depression, mood swings, weight gain, and hormonal acne.
16	115	I do still experience slight mood swings and some hormonal acne.
16	116	Also had acne which was new to me.
16	117	No change in my weight, emotions, sex drive, acne (if anything my skin has been better).
16	118	However, my acne started to look clearer hours after taking it.
16	119	I had very light periods, didn't gain any weight, 0 acne, and no extreme moodswings that I could attribute to the lolo.
16	120	Besides that I haven't had any signs of weight gain or acne, etc.
16	121	I got cyst like acne, I had mood swings, and I had my period for 2 to 3 weeks at a time.
16	122	Once I got to the 4th, 5th, and 6th month the acne cleared, the mood swings have dramatically decreased (i just get teary at sappy things end of month), and I've actually skipped periods.
16	123	Also while taking my acne actually got better.
16	124	I didn't gain any weight and it didn't change my acne (I have naturally pretty clear skin) BUT, this made my emotions a complete roller coaster.
16	125	Also, the first three years I never experienced ANY acne.
16	126	I was experiencing terrible acne out of nowhere in my 30s.
16	127	I stopped the pill immediately (mid pack) and the acne cleared up after only a week.
16	128	No personality/mood swings of any kind, no weight gain/bodily changes, no acne, no migraines or backpain, no loss in sex drive etc.
16	129	In the beginning there was cystic acne (face, chest,back), mild weight gain/bloating and mild mood swings.
16	130	After four months the acne cleared up but the mood swings worsened and depression kicked in.
16	131	I was extremely nauseous, light headed, dizzy, un-motivated, VERY tired, irritable, I would black out daily,  I started breaking out (never had acne before), also it messed w/ my vision.
16	132	I originally went on this pill because I had bad acne and my doctor suggested LoLo because of my age.
16	133	In the time since I started it, I have gained weight, have had headaches every day, acne on my face and chest (have never had an issue before) and my sex drive has literally become non-existent.
16	134	I just had my third breakdown in 2 days which is uncommon for me as I normally don't cry very often...AND I'm getting acne on my face, chest and back which I haven't had a problem with in over 5 years.
16	135	Common side effects of Lo Loestrin Fe include vaginal bleeding between periods (spotting) or missed/irregular periods, breast tenderness, headache, acne, nausea, vomiting, bloating, swelling of the ankles or feet (fluid retention), or weight changes.
16	136	I havent had any weight changes, acne changes or anything like that.
16	137	Love the no periods part ..hated the constant cystic acne on my chin that doesn't seem to go away with anything ..no mood swings no weight gain no complains except for the acne .oh and the price .
16	138	My acne cleared up majorly and my face is completely clear now!
16	139	I had moderate cystic acne and now it's completely gone!
16	140	No issues with acne but I have a very strong regime for that due to the type of skin I have.
16	141	I've lost weight instead of gain, no acne, no pain in legs or any other part of my body, no cramps, and no spotting either.
16	142	I have all of the symptoms: horrible deep acne, headache, nausea, mood swings and the constant spotting!!
16	143	Also in the beginning of taking the pill I had very bad acne breakout but towards the end of the month my acne began to clear up.
16	144	Right now I have almost no acne and just tiny blemishes.
16	145	Pretty amazing to me since I've always had acne problems.
16	146	I was on it for 3 months and I got two periods a month (PLUS breakthrough bleeding), worsened acne that only went away on the break, as well as bad mood swings.
16	147	I'm switching to Diane 35 for my cystic acne ( which loestrin fe made worse).
16	148	I've broken out worse than before with the deep cystic acne.
16	149	I love this birth control, no headaches, no acne, my periods are very light and manageable cramps.
16	150	At first, I didn't really think it was the birth control until weeks later when the acne got even worse.
16	151	Poor body image issues, depression worsened, bloating-instant weight gain feeling, horrible cystic acne that Retin - A could not even treat.
16	152	Mood swings, uncontrollable bleeding, cystic acne, no sex drive.
16	153	I had severe anxiety, hot flashes, stomach pain, no appetite, sudden loss of positive body image, it caused me to have horrible cystic acne.
16	154	No acne and I didn't experience any weight gain until the 10th month but that's because I'm not really eating correctly.
16	155	No periods, no cramps, very little acne at the very end and beginning of packs but that is about the only negative thing.
16	156	No weight gain, didn't positively or negatively effect my acne, only complaint is I'm super dry and have a very low libido.
16	157	Now that I'm on it, no sore boobs, no moodiness, no weight gain, no acne.
16	158	& I have bad acne.
16	159	No acne, no headaches.
16	160	Needed something for birth control and acne that would not cause me to gain weight like ortho tri cyclen lo did.
16	161	I have not gained any more weight since my terrible experience with ortho tri cyclen lo, but my acne hasn't improved at all so I'm beginning accutane and staying on lo estrin fe to combat that problem.
16	162	I tried Seasonale and Marvelon and spotted non stop, gained 10lbs in a year and experienced acne, which I'm lucky to rarely have.
16	163	I still experience some PMS (a few acne spots on my jawline and I'm extra moody/ hungry), but I haven't had a period the entire time.
16	164	This is the safest type of progestin type in terms of blood clots, the pill is highly androgenic (so, sorry for those with a pre-existing tendency towards acne; this pill may not be the best for you), but for the rest of us it means your sex drive will likely stay intact.
16	165	I had cystic acne after I got off of depo birth control and I hadn't realized it was due to the extreme drop of estrogen in my body.
16	166	My acne cleared up within a month and I only get a couple pimples here and there but my skin is finally smooth!
16	167	I have been on it for about two years and the first six months were great; I never had periods, no acne, slight moodiness but that seemed pretty normal.
16	168	And for the last year and half I have had horrible acne, I have been very moody, and irregularity in my periods.
16	169	I have acne but don't mind taking this because it has not made it any worse.
16	170	I do have a bit of acne, nothing serious though.
16	171	Experienced NO weight gain, acne, mood swings, etc.
16	172	It's obviously effective because I'm not pregnant, but the only problems I have are weight gain (I'm eating like a horse) and the worst acne I've probably ever had in my life.
16	173	No noticeable changes in mood, sex drive, or acne.
16	174	No weight gain, acne, irregular periods, nothing.
16	175	One gave me horrible acne, the other migraine headaches so horrible if I didn't lay down I felt faint.
16	176	If you are taking this for acne, it is not going to help you.
16	177	It is not meant to help treat acne.
16	178	Though I did get more acne than normal since starting, that very well just may be the fact I'm a teenager.
16	179	No extreme side effects, no weight gain, no acne, just AWESOME!
16	180	First of all, I already suffer from acne, which is slowly improving.
16	181	However, this made my acne really bad and I began to develop cystic acne.
16	182	The first two months adjusting were definitely a bit tough: nausea, headache, breast tenderness, bizarre acne.
16	183	Prior to taking this pill I always had acne problems.
16	184	I'd say after the first 2 months my acne was back to normal and now it's beginning to get better.
16	185	I see a lot of girls talking about how horrible it makes their acne but my dermatologist said give it 6 months and see.
16	186	I had no side effects aside from the acne.
16	187	Unfortunately, near the end I begin experiencing severe vaginal dryness, pain during intercourse, mood swings, and acne.
16	188	I'm broke out in bad acne having mood swings and depression, which I don't like.
16	189	After that things pretty well smoothed out slowly I didn't break through bleed, didn't gain weight, acne cleared up maybe 5 periods the whole time I took it.
16	190	The first month or two I did experience some acne and occasional nausea, as well as going from a B to C cup (a welcome change.)
16	191	I had acne problems before this pill and I thought by going on this I could kill to birds with one stone; clear up my acne and prevent pregnancy.
16	192	Within the first day my acne got 10x worse and it's only been a week but it's worse than it's ever been in the last year!
16	193	No acne, no mood changes.
16	194	I didn't experience any mood swings, had little to mild acne around my period, never experienced any pregnancy scares, and had no nausea, headaches or weight gain.
16	195	This summer and last summer I had some random cystic acne though I am not sure it is related to the pill because other times my skin is perfectly clear.
16	196	Loestrin 1/20 had me crazy moody, bad acne, and melasma on my face.
16	197	Once I switched to Lo Loestrin Fe no more crazy mood, acne is pretty much gone.
16	198	I have noticed a decrease in migraines (I didn't get them that often, but still), slight increase in breast size, no weight change, and not really any change in acne.
16	199	This has increased my breast size by a cup, cleared up my acne, haven't gained any weight (I am a very healthy eater although) my periods are light maybe lasting 3 days my cramps are very mild if any (Aleve liquid gels are the best).
16	200	No acne or mood swings.
16	201	Oh yea and to top it off I also got more acne and back /chest pain
16	202	I've started having breakthrough bleeding and horrible acne.
16	203	I had no acne or weight gain, and my moods are stable.
16	204	I have no mood swings, acne, weight gain, headaches, nausea, etc.
16	205	All of that has been extremely positive except it gave me horrible acne which I have never had, ever.
16	206	No acne, thankfully.
16	207	I recommend it if you have any issues with acne, cramping, or irregularity.
16	208	I am switching at the end of my pack because I just can't handle the awful acne!
16	209	I read a few of the reviews on this page and many said that in the first month or so they had terrible acne!
16	210	I was switched to Lo Loestrin which has lower hormones and I guess it messed up all my hormones because I started breaking out in the worst cystic acne.
16	211	Now it is out of control and I'm starting to develop dark spots (scarring) from the cystic acne.
16	212	However, halfway through this second month and my chin/mouth area has never had such acne!
16	213	I had occasional acne, like many people, but 90% of the time my skin was clear before.
16	214	I did experience acne when starting, on the second month I had none.
16	215	Before I started the pill, I had problems with acne and now I have virtually none at all.
16	216	Also, my face erupted with terrrrrrrible cystic acne.
16	217	I have had no weight gain, no acne, no crazy mood swings...
16	218	I rarely ever got acne, now I have acne all the time.
16	219	I did gain weight with this medication (5lbs) which is not bad for me because i was way too skinny ,  no mood swings no acne.
16	220	I'm 19 and have now been on lo loestrin for almost 2 months, I have noticed a major breakout of acne in my chin area.
16	221	Since I've been on this one, I've been a little moodier, more acne, breast tenderness and cramping without periods.
16	222	I started this birth control three weeks ago and now I have the worst acne I've had since being a teenager.
16	223	I'm breaking out with hormonal acne that no matter what just don't want to go away.
16	224	Pros thus far: no breast tenderness (they did increase in size), no acne (skin actually cleared up), no weight gain (I'm very active to begin with), no nausea or headaches, much lighter periods (prior to the pill, my periods were heavy enough where both a pad and a tampon were needed... Now a tampon alone is good enough!)
16	225	I see less acne though.
16	226	No acne yet.
16	227	I used the medication for one month and during that time my face broke out in acne, and I have not been able to get the acne to go away in a year.
16	228	Even though this pill is unpredictable, I don't have headaches, breast tenderness, or acne like my last pill.
16	229	No acne, a little weight gain, and tender breast.
16	230	I have bad cramping and bloating to the point where it feels like my period wants to come on but wont, I have very bad mood swings which is affecting my relationship, breast tenderness , I take a pregnancy test every month because I have pregnancy symptoms, my sex drive is really low but the pill works very well preventing pregnancy, I never really had an acne problem until I started taking these pills, I have not gained any weight but I have not lost any either and I work out a lot.
16	231	My doctor specifically prescribed this for my acne and unfortunately it did nothing but make my skin much worse.
16	232	If you are looking for a birth control that helps with acne I recommend Apri because my skin is clearing up and I have no side effects!
16	233	I've lost 10 pounds, no acne, and no depression which is the main reason I switched.
16	234	No weight gain, no acne.
16	235	I haven't experienced weight gain or bad acne.
16	236	The cramping was bad and I had acne like crazy.
16	237	Also, sometime during the 2nd pack of pills I had a horrible acne outbreak that I couldn't figure out.
16	238	But in month 7 I started having horrific cystic acne.
16	239	I've never had cystic acne and now at age 27 it is unbearable and painful.
16	240	My acne cleared up by month six.
16	241	Now halfway through third month, terrible acne.
16	242	I have horrible acne but just starting Lo Loestrin has cleared up my skin so much!
16	243	I'm 23 and don't use it for painful periods but to help with my mood and acne.
16	244	I have horrible acne (on my face, back, chest, and shoulders) since I have been taking this birth control my acne is little to none, thank God!
16	245	I didn't gain weight, my acne didn't get worse or better, my sex drive is fine and really I didn't have any of the awful symptoms that typically accompany birth controls.
16	246	I have always had some acne and it had been pretty bad shortly before taking this but it got way better right before I started this.
16	247	However, after taking this, my acne was the worst it had been in a long time, maybe ever.
16	248	Some things I've noticed is more headaches, ankle tension, random leg pain, and acne!
16	249	Only negative effect is acne, but I'm hoping this will clear up as I continue to take it.
16	250	It has helped with my acne and made my periods lighter with less cramping, but the bloating lasts for the majority of the month and food cravings come often.
16	251	I've also generally had lighter acne, only breaking out in one place at a time, but since starting Lo Loestrin Fe I seem to be breaking out more.
16	252	I was put on it for polycystic ovarian syndrome to try to help with weight, facial hair, acne, and ovulation.
16	253	My periods were messed up, I gained 10 pounds in 7 days and it made the acne worse.
16	254	periods are two days, if that, no acne, no weight gain(actually lost 15 pounds in the first 2 months), no labido changes.
16	255	No nausea, acne, tender breasts, weight gain, etc.
16	256	I experienced bloating, depression, acne.
16	257	My acne was intense, especially on my back.
16	258	No acne, light or no period, absolutely no cramps, minimal cramps, no nausea.
16	259	Been taking for 3 months, first 2 months were ok but now I am getting acne worse than I have ever had in my life and its expensive.
16	260	I haven't experienced any mood swings, acne or weight gain, however it is early on and I will be watching out for that.
16	261	I haven't had any noticeable weight gain or acne.
16	262	However after two months of being on the pill, my breasts shrunk back to their normal size, my sex drive was completely gone, and my face broke out in horrendous acne.
16	263	The only physical side effects I've experienced are moderate breast tenderness and yesterday I noticed a small patch of acne on my face.
16	264	I am not really prone to acne and if I do get it it's just one pimple on my nose, forehead, or chin, but this time it's a patch of a bunch of small pimples on my cheek/nose, almost like a rash but not.
16	265	In the morning, the breasts were swollen, I had some acne, and the bleeding was much heavier than normal.
16	266	I am experiencing bad acne, spotting and still have abnormal periods.
16	267	I have very little side effects, like when on the blue pills in the pack, I have a little bit of acne but when my period comes at the end of the pack the acne goes away.
16	268	It has helped clear up my acne, and I've noticed that I've started losing weight in what seems like all the right places!
16	269	No weight gain, no acne, no bleeding, no change in libido.
16	270	I have had some acne, but it is minimal.
16	271	No acne, no mood swings, NO MIGRAINES.
16	272	I started Lo-Loestrin Fe two months ago and am having the worst acne breakouts I have ever had!
16	273	I am getting married in three weeks and nothing will work to clear up the acne.
16	274	8 days into my second pack I started breaking out on my forehead &chin.
16	275	Surprisingly I haven't gained any weight but my skin is breaking out due to my gluten and dairy allergies.
16	276	I've also been breaking out really bad.
16	277	My face first started by breaking out really bad everywhere.
16	278	I spotted for the first week or two, I was breaking out a little more than normal (usually I get 1-2 pimples on my chin right before my period) but this made me break out about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks into my pack:( and would only "clear" up for about a week before it started again.
16	279	My skin cleared up for about a month then all of a sudden I've been breaking out for frequently.
16	280	My body took a couple months to adjust to it and there was spotting for a couple weeks at a time and breaking out but these are only temporary side effects and around pack 3 or 4 everything was great.
16	281	I started this birth control a month ago and my face started breaking out the first week.
16	282	I contacted my doctor and haven't used the birth control for over a week now and my face is still breaking out.
16	283	But other then that I recommend it for not worrying about breaking out or gaining much weight .
16	284	I was breaking out, cramps were TERRIBLE,  irritable and felt like I had no energy BUT I found out I was also extremely deficient in Vitamin D and I needed more potassium.
16	285	I started breaking out 2 days after taking the pills.
16	286	I have been using Lo Loestrin Fe for 1 month now and I've had my period three times this month, breaking out like crazy, and have so many mood swings with depression.
16	287	I have been on this pill for 5 months and it was fine until I started breaking out all over my face.
16	288	Pimples, severe bloating and weight gain......pimples......oh the pimples
16	289	I had clear skin before starting, and for this entire month I've had cystic pimples all along my jaw line and neck, and pimples around my mouth and chin.
16	290	At first I would get the typical spotting through the pill package and I had horrible breakouts around my chin (I never got breakout, maybe 1-2 pimples before my period).
16	291	I started to have a painful inflammatory pimples...
16	292	The first 2-3 months were okay, a few more pimples than normal but no big deal.
16	293	I did get some pimples but that could be due to anything.
16	294	My skin started breaking like crazy with deep pimples, which is mainly why I'm switching.
16	295	Took for 3.5 weeks, had decent skin with occasional pimple prior to starting, started to have large pimples on cheek and forehead at end of first week.
16	296	No periods, no babies, hardly any pimples, no cramps, and I didn't gain weight.
16	297	I'll get maybe two tiny pimples in total nearing my period and that's it.
16	298	I've only hear about terrifying stories from my friends on how birth control makes them fat and get pimples !
16	299	I have tons of small pimples all over my forehead and chin and big pimples on my back.
16	300	I also noticed that I had a couple of pimples but since there were only a couple, I figured it could have been my normal hormonal changes during the month.
16	301	I never had a lot of pimples but my face has cleared up and haven't lost or gained weight.
16	302	Pros: clear skin (1-2 pimples a day before I start but that's it).
16	303	I have slight headaches which I know is from the pill and getting used to it and my skin went from flawless to 7 or 8 pimples so I'm pretty angry.
16	304	I have huge red zits all over my face and it seems like when one goes away, I get three more.
16	305	My face is covered in dark marks and painful volcano like zits.
16	306	I have some zits now from it as well but that's better than all that other crazy stuff...
16	307	It did cause me to wake up a little nauseous a couple nights and I did get a couple of zits over the last couple of weeks.
16	308	Highly recommend for those who have excessive cramps or bleeding.
16	309	With the first pack I began spotting 10 days before my period was due accompanied by severe cramps and bloating.
16	310	Actual period came before placebo pills and lasted about 4 days with the worst menstrual cramps I’ve ever had.
16	311	Continued to spot after my period daily for the next two weeks, again with cramps and nausea daily.
16	312	However the past 2 months during my period the bleeding has come back and I've had the WORST menstrual cramps of my life.
16	313	The side effects were no longer worth the less severe cramps.
16	314	I hate this birth control so much and the only reason I'm still on it is  1- I don't get pregnant and 2- my cramps were insanely painful.
16	315	I guess the only thing it did right was that it sort of made my cramps better?
16	316	My breast were really tender, felt very nauseated to the point of almost vomiting, pelvic cramps, mild mood swings, UTI, discharge.
16	317	I usually have severe cramps but it helped those out.
16	318	Hardly any cramps, and my period has gone down to 2-3 days of mostly light spotting.
16	319	I bled for about 12 days and experienced some of the worst cramps ever!
16	320	Been on this pill for almost 8 months and the bloating/ cramps are just getting worse and worse.
16	321	Took this for two months and was extremely moody, spotted and had cramps for two and a half weeks, randomly would get tension headaches, very low energy and had extremely low self esteem.
16	322	I still experienced PMS cramps and back pain right before my period.
16	323	But I experienced all the other effects of a period such as bloating, cramps, PMS.
16	324	I was bedridden from cramps and I bled a lot but honestly I was used to it since the reason I'm taking it is because of nasty periods.
16	325	My periods lasted 3-4 days, barely any bleeding, zero cramps, and I had no side effects!
16	326	At first it caused   some spotting before I got my period, lots of random cramps, and I got my period around 3 days late and usually I'd get my period for 5 days, now I was getting it for 7-8 days.
16	327	I used to get brutal cramps and long periods.
16	328	No matter what type of birth control I had debilitating cramps.
16	329	Lolo has caused my cramps to stop and my period is consistent and lasts 2 days.
16	330	I started taking this because of the painful cramps I get once a month.
16	331	), I've gained a few pounds each week, and now I'm getting painful cramps (the reason I even started taking this stuff) weeks before my period is supposed to start.
16	332	It also made my periods closer together and my cramps more painful.
16	333	Took away all my cramps.
16	334	And I've been getting cramps up to 2 weeks ahead of my period!
16	335	Even with the endometriosis, cramps don't usually come til a few days before my period.
16	336	I love that my period was only 2 days long but this time around out didn't help with my cramps at all.
16	337	My period still came on a couple days early and was regular but I have cramps even after my period.
16	338	It gurgles and cramps.
16	339	I have occasionally suffered from random cramps, usually due to shifting the time I took my pills during the time changes of the year.
16	340	I never had bad cramps.
16	341	My face has cleared up, my cramps have gone away, I hardly get a period, no weight gain.
16	342	Here and there I had nausea, but that was nothing compare the cramps I was having before.
16	343	I started this just to see if it would help with my period and the cramps I had.
16	344	I stopped when I started my period and the cramps were worse than they have ever been before.
16	345	I went on this pill to help with the cramps I had, lasted two weeks long sometimes!
16	346	The downside irregular periods, brown discharge and mild cramps when not on cycle.
16	347	I've been on it for about a month and the only issue is that I have bad cramps but not as bad as what I used to have before this bc.
16	348	I used to have horrible cramps and nausea but on this pill I had no nausea and the cramps were very little, I almost never had to take medicine for the pain.
16	349	Lasted 10 days (I stopped the pill after 7 days) with heavy bleeding and severe abdominal cramps, very clotty.
16	350	Heavy bleeding for 5 days, cramps that shot down into my feet, nausea to the point of vomiting, etc.
16	351	I had lighter periods and my cramps were not so bad for the first year or so.
16	352	I'm not bleeding heavy but the cramps are awful.
16	353	The only thing negative so far for me is that I have had spotting/period in the middle of each pack, which is VERY light, as well as cramps for about 4 days straight.
16	354	My first month my period came a week early which I thought was normal since my period is usually irregular, that period continued on and lasted 16 days with extremely heavy flow and horrible cramps.
16	355	Two days in a row I've jumped up at 4:30am with the WORST lower abdominal cramps.
16	356	My cramps even lessened and I don't have to take anything for them anymore which is fantastic!
16	357	I got on this pill for endometriosis, usually I have debilitating cramps and severe proctalgia fugax during my period and not have experienced any of that.
16	358	After 4 days of taking it, I kept waking up with really bad cramps and brown spotting which is really annoying.
16	359	My period went back to being heavy and my cramps even worse than before, but this time it came with intense mood swings.
16	360	My doctor prescribed me Lo Loestrin when I was 15 to treat my heavy, irregular periods and cramps that would cause me to stay home from school/other obligations for days at a time.
16	361	I used to get debilitating cramps and ovarian cysts that put me in the hospital.
16	362	PROS: NO periods, no cramps, no mood swings, all gone :D!!
16	363	I still get PMS symptoms, cramps, and a pimple the week before my last pill, but FAR less severe.
16	364	I don't get any cramps or periods at all.
16	365	And lastly my doctor advised me it would ease my cramps, which was a lie it actually made the pain worst.
16	366	I had severe cramps unlike anything i have ever had (and im 26).
16	367	I have now been bleeding for 12 days and the severe cramps continued up until i went off the pill myself.
16	368	Besides the cramps i was extremely moody and depressed.
16	369	The cramps remain and are horrible.
16	370	Within the first week, I had cramps, tender breasts, and break through bleeding.
16	371	After taking it for the first time, I basically had what felt like severe PMS for a week or so, accompanied by cramps, general moodiness, and spotting.
16	372	I still have pretty bad cramps when I'm on my period,  so it didn't help with that.
16	373	Fast forward 6 months and I still have headaches every day, mood swings, issues with labido, stomach cramps, fatigue, feeling sad and down all the time, and I have gained 16 pounds!
16	374	I have been taking Lo Loestrin Fe for over A year now, it's the best birth control I've ever taken, I use to have heavy cycles, the worst cramps, and would have to take off work because of being nausea and sick once a month.
16	375	Horrible I started it about 3 weeks ago now and since my anxiety has been horrible I cannot enjoy my days I'm constantly nauseous severe cramps and I've started bleeding again two days ago and my pains are horrible when my bleeding started again I also had pretty bad diahrea my stomach has always been a strong one and it seems to be so far off and upset all the time now I've got weird headaches dizziness and lower back pain this pill sucks will stop taking this pill after today when I finally realized what it really was
16	376	Not just a little spotting but full out blood almost like a period And with cramps!
16	377	I even had cramps.
16	378	Short periods, almost no cramps.
16	379	At first it made me bleed a lot, gave me terrible cramps and made me cry for two days straight.
16	380	Before I changed birth controls I noticed my discharge was brown , my doctor said this was normal , but it slowly got heavier , and now that I've started lolo(a little over a week ago)  I have bad cramps and I've been bleeding the entire time on lolo.
16	381	I literally had my period for about a month with the worst cramps I have ever experienced.
16	382	From the day I started taking it; it was "not bad" but with in a week my period came back in a horrible way with the worst cramps ever.
16	383	I began taking this in August (7 months ago) I have been such a happier person and not having cramps from my use to be periods is awesome, that only problem I have it that I am extremely bloated 3/4 weeks of the month and its started to really bother me with summer around the corner.
16	384	It made my period cramps and back pain worse.
16	385	I originally got on the pill for my heavy period and severe PMS and I've had zero cramps and no bloating.
16	386	I began having cramps to the point I wanted to curl up in a ball and not move during my period, and I had 2 periods plus spotting in one month.
16	387	I have bled so badly ever since I started it and have experienced the worst and most continual cramps.
16	388	My bleeding is barely anything and my cramps are barely there.
16	389	I also have been getting strong persistent cramps every night.
16	390	Before I started taking Lo Lo I had heavy periods and really bad cramps, so bad I had to leave school sometimes.
16	391	I no longer have cramps and I either don't have my period or it last for only one day.
16	392	Only problem I have had with it was when I got off an antibiotic I had small cramps for the 1st month back on.
16	393	Sounds dramatic but it's true - before, no matter which pill, I was experiencing excruciating cramps, back aches, mood swings and very heavy bleeding for at least 6 days.
16	394	I suffered from such bad cramps before that I would be throwing up nonstop for hours.
16	395	I experienced NO weight gain, NO breakouts, NO mood swings, NO cramps, but I never had bad cramps anyway.
16	396	I took this for serious cramps.
16	397	This did NOT help with my cramps at all, in fact it probably made it worse.
16	398	My skin was relatively clear, my cramps almost completely disappeared (they were very severe before) and my period lasted 3-4 days.
16	399	The doctor suggested it because I did have painful cramps that were regular she said that should disappear.
16	400	IT HASN'T, terrible cramps, bleeding all the time, my face broke out and I have like 0 sex drive.
16	401	I had horrid cramps and really bad PMS (PMDD) and it's all gone now.
16	402	I got on this pill because I wouldn't get a period for about 4 or 5 months and when I finally got my period it was super heavy and cramps were unbearable.
16	403	But this month I have been spotting none stop and waking up with cramps everyday.
16	404	I went on these for irregular periods, bad cramps, and to prevent pregnancy.
16	405	I started taking this as a treatment for my endometriosis (aka cripling cramps and painful sex.)
16	406	And my cramps were totally intensified!
16	407	It's the end of my 3rd month and I've literally had 3 periods this month, with my current one bringing on just as bad cramps as I experienced without the pill!
16	408	This has done nothing to lessen my cramps and has made me (and my menstrual cycle) a total mess.
16	409	Ever since I've taken this, I haven't had any cramps or backaches, I now have wonderfully clear skin, and my boobs actually became a cup size smaller.
16	410	My periods are almost non existent, no cramps or bloating either.
16	411	Every once in a while I'll experience some light cramps right before I finish a pack (around the time I should have my period), but other than that I love this pill!
16	412	I had hoped that taking lo loestrin would help with my cramps and back pain but they are the same as before.
16	413	My period was 7 days and it was very light and I didn't have bad cramps.
16	414	However, by the second month I began experiencing horrible stomach cramps, to the point where I was unable to move and would eventually throw up from the pain.
16	415	Mood changes disappeared, no period, no cramps, no soreness.
16	416	When I told my Doctor, she said I could take the blue pills continuously and now I have no periods, no cramps, and no mood swings.
16	417	Last Thursday I got my period again this time full on with cramps and everything.
16	418	My side effects include constant cramps and abdominal pain, complete
16	419	Sometimes I had the usual cramps and mood swings around the time I was suppose to have my period but no bleeding.
16	420	Started the pills and was excited because I needed help with regularity and cramps.
16	421	As far as periods go..this still gave me a period and I ended up having brown spotting (gross), back pain, and cramps.
16	422	It's been at least seven months now and I get hardly any cramps, whereas before I used to get them so bad that I'd fall on the floor in pain.
16	423	I use to have very heavy period that would last 7 days but now I don't even get one at all (no cramps either)!
16	424	Usually by this time on other birth controls I have had debilitating migraines and cramps.
16	425	Definitely experienced a few mood swings and the tender boobs though (to the point of my bra even hurting them, which sucked but only lasted about a week) Usually have a one or two day periods, with mediumish flow and no cramps (so only on Lolo to prevent little mes!)
16	426	The crazy moods never stopped and the cramps were horrible.
16	427	About 3 days into the pill my bleeding has completly stopped, no cramps, no clots.
16	428	Ever since then I have had no period, no weight gain, no cramps, no breakthrough bleeding, no spotting, no nothing!
16	429	I rarely get cramps now & my period is pretty much non existent which I was nervous about at first but now I'm ok with it.
16	430	My periods are increasingly light, short, and cramps are way less severe.
16	431	Absolutely no cramps or nausea.
16	432	I still get cramps and bloating, a few break outs, but no other side effects.
16	433	Started on the pills to help with extreme bleeding, cramps and mood swings.
16	434	No period, no weight gain, nausea, cramps, or breast tenderness...
16	435	It definitely helped with cramps and pain, which is why I began taking it.
16	436	I have been taking it for over 2 years for my horrible menstrual cramps and I love it.
16	437	This pill completely stopped my period with NO spotting or anything, and never any cramps.
16	438	I got on it because I've had horrible cramps, and heavy bleeding on my period.
16	439	I only have a period for 2 days, I get mild cramps now.
16	440	I had cramps so bad.
16	441	I was on two other types of birth control before, nuva ring and another oral pill that drove me crazy, nausea, crazy mood swings, cramps, heavy periods, the works.
16	442	I went on this birth control because I had a very irregular period and terrible cramps.
16	443	No period to speak of and no cramps.
16	444	I love this pill I have no side effects and if anything it made my period better it's shorter, comes right on time when the pill changes color, minor cramps, no mood swings.
16	445	I have NO cramps (such a life saver!).
16	446	I stopped taking birth control all together it caused back pain, cramps, headaches.
16	447	My cramps are in my back and constant.
16	448	I no longer have my period, but around the time I used to get my period every month I get light cramps.
16	449	I've been on it for three months and it's helped me a lot with my cramps, I barely even have any, and when I do they are very manageable.
16	450	I didn't have any cramps and I also didn't have a period!
16	451	I have only been on for a month and I have mood swings, breast tenderness, horrible cramps, food cravings, no period, and I'm always tired like winded tired
16	452	I loved this pill at first, it got rid if my terrible cramps.
16	453	On my period i have medium-high cramps, back pains, and my breasts are sore.
16	454	I'll have horrible cramps before my period and while on it.
16	455	I would get cramps and my breast would get very tender and my mood would change as well as my appetite.
16	456	Turns out that when I switched I only had a period for 5 days straight in June 2013 and now we are in October and I haven't had any cramps or a period for that matter.
16	457	Ever since this pill, my period is where the blue pills stop and my period is so light, no cramps, no PMS.
16	458	No cramps (I've always suffered from bad ones) Energetic.
16	459	As the months have gone by though my "periods" have been getting lighter and lighter and this month (month 7) is the first month I haven't had my light discharge and cramps after the placebo pills.
16	460	Fortunately this pill did stop me from getting periods (which is normal on some birth controls) and I had no side effects like weight gain, cramps, irritability etc.
16	461	Every now and then I'll have a month where I get cramps during the "reminder pill" portion of the pack but it's not common.
16	462	I'm on my 9th month; just about 40 years old, given to me for severe cramps and horrible bleeding that has worsened over the past 2 years.
16	463	I'm 41, using for cramps and excessive bleeding.
16	464	For years I have suffered from horrible bleeding, menstrual cramps that kept me in bed for a day or two and sometimes  vomiting.
16	465	I get no period and no cramps.
16	466	The only problem I'm having with it right now is that I got my period, but it isn't any shorter or lighter than usual and I'm getting mild cramps.
16	467	I had maybe 2 days of spotting the first month but now I have a 1 day light period, hardly any cramps, and no mood swings.
16	468	I also suffer from endometriosis, which leaves me with very very painful period cramps and serious PMS symptoms and bleeding.
16	469	I've had insanely bad cramps on these that I never used to have, and have had my period for two weeks straight just about, the bleeding still heavier than ever.
16	470	It took about three months for it to regulate my periods and for the headaches and nausea to go away, and then my periods came two days a month and were extremely light with no cramps.
16	471	Before starting this medication, I had horrible menstrual cycles & bad symptoms such as neck pain, back pain, heavy bleeding, cramps, mood swings & hot flashes.
16	472	I'm sexually active, but it was mainly for cramps and heavy bleeding.
16	473	The first month of pills I did not get a period but I have had minor cramps around period time.
16	474	I'm on my 3rd pack and my only complaint is that I had really heavy bleeding last month and cramps :/ but other than that no side effects at all, and my breasts got bigger.
16	475	After that I have had no periods at all but I do get some cramps when I am supposed to have it.
16	476	I used to have horrible cramps and heavy bleeding.
16	477	Only been on it for 2 months and lost 3 pounds, my period is lighter and no cramps, only problem the pill is mad expensive with insurance and coupons brings it to $50.
16	478	Since my switch to Lo Loestrin, the bleeding stopped, however my cramps right now are severe.
16	479	I was prescribed Lo Loestrin Fe for my debilitating cramps and anemia.
16	480	In month 4 I have no period but I have light cramps that's okay because they were worse on the other one.
16	481	As well this is not your normal low flow, cramp free type of cycle.
16	482	I had a 2 week long period in the first month and haven't had one since but I still cramp at times.
16	483	I bled all month long and with the last 4 pills I didn't even spot or cramp.
16	484	I started this for extreme cramping and excessive bleeding, and after a full month of Lo Loestrin Fe, it went away!
16	485	My periods only lasted about 2 days and I had little to no cramping.
16	486	I've experienced hair loss, Horrible cramping when its time to come on.
16	487	I started taking this medication to help control the extreme cramping I was experiencing.
16	488	I have only had one period while taking this and it lasted about 2 weeks with minimal cramping and spotting.
16	489	After first the yeast infections went away and after a few months on Lolo I wasn't bleeding at all and no cramping.
16	490	I also noticed if I forgot to take my pill, and it was the next day, I would have cramping and what felt like the start of my period.
16	491	I have lighter periods that last for almost three to four days and hardly any cramping.
16	492	This pill has stopped all my cramping and been amazing.
16	493	Good: Hardly bled at all, very little cramping, no babies
16	494	Yet I do have some light cramping in my  uterus.
16	495	The couple times I actually had my period while on this pill, I had yeast infection-like symptoms (to which my gynecologist said was normal) and horrendous cramping.
16	496	I had random light cramping and spotting initially, which is expected.
16	497	I have had two periods each month with bad cramping.
16	498	My stomach has some cramping as well.
16	499	A couple of days ago April 8th I started taking the pills everyday and the cramping are starting to decrease but I have headaches and My stomach bubbled up like I had diarrhea & I felt nauseous at one point .
16	500	Only reason I didn't give it 10 is because it has not significantly reduced my cramping when menstruating.
16	501	I'm in my mid 20s and have been on this pill for about 5 months it works well I spot a little but typically haven't had a full cycle, I do have mood swings and lately some really bad cramping!!
16	502	It wasn't an awful period, it was actually light with minimal cramping.
16	503	In addition my cramping was constant and EXTREMELY painful making it difficult for me to participate in everyday activities.
16	504	I had slight cramping, felt a little crazy and periods lasting about 3-4 days seeming no different than normal.
16	505	I no longer had periods which I loved, no bleeding, cramping, or bloating ever.
16	506	After my first year I started having a "period" 2 weeks into the pack which only consisted of extreme cramping and some brown discharge for a few days.
16	507	I had some mild cramping, which I didn't even have to take Advil for.
16	508	I started pack 2, and during week 2, I start to get this awful cramping in my stomach, like how I would days before my period.
16	509	Then the cramping gets 100X worse, and I go from spotting a little brown blood, to having a FULL BLOWN PAINFUL PERIOD!
16	510	The 2nd week I was bleeding, bad cramping, and clotting as well...I just assumed it was my body getting used to it after that I got bad bloating to the point that my bladder had pressure on it and I felt the full urgency feeling but did not have a UTI!
16	511	However, upon beginning a new workout regime I began to experience horrible cramping, similar to period cramping, and breakthrough bleeding.
16	512	I'm 17, and got on this to help my severe cramping and just to help my period in general really, didn't even finish my sample packet.
16	513	I was put in this pill to help with heavy bleeding, well I'm in my first month I bled every single day from the first to the last pill, the cramping is unbearable it feels like contractions.
16	514	I used to get crampy periods and since I've been on it I get no cramping whatsoever, barely-there periods (I spot just a tiny bit and then that's it), and no weight gain or moodiness.
16	515	The first month I bleed for 7 days one day longer then I usually do with a lot of cramping and clotting.
16	516	At first I loved it because my periods were lighter, no cramping, no weight gain.
16	517	My boobs went from an A to a C, I have no cramping, really light periods that last 2-3 days, and I've had no weight gain.
16	518	I was on LoLo for almost 3 months to help with my endometriosis and monthly cramping.
16	519	I used to get horrible heavy periods in which I would go through at least seven super tampons a day with extreme cramping.
16	520	I now get a period every month and they are light, last 4-5 days, but I still get intense cramping.
16	521	Days off school and work since I was 11, nausea, fever, severe cramping, night sweats, headaches, backpain etc.
16	522	I haven't experienced any cramping, mood swings, intermittent bleeding, etc.
16	523	On my first two months my periods were a little off because it still needed to kick in but after that I had very light periods and only slight cramping and my skin did clear up a little.
16	524	The other good side to the pill is that it stopped the cramping immediately.
16	525	My period has come on time for the past 2 months and it's light although I still have cramping but maybe that'll go away.
16	526	Still have cramping (which is why I started this pill in the first place).
16	527	It worked great, my periods were really heavy and I had a lot of cramping but when I started taking this I had little to no period and no cramping.
16	528	Now I'm back to heavy periods and lots of cramping.
16	529	The first few months were great, very little cramping and light bleeding, periods only lasted about 3 days.
16	530	I didn't get my period the first month and the only side effects I get are sore boobs, cramping (during the same time every month), and minor mood swings.
16	531	Horrible cramping, hot flashes, mood swings.
16	532	My periods only last 3 days now and I have little cramping.
16	533	I have had some cramping throughout the month and missed my period the 4th month.
16	534	Each period has been lighter and shorter than they were before, with some cramping but nothing terrible.
16	535	No cramping whatsoever.
16	536	Where as on Lolo I have had one headache, and one five minute cramping session both on the same day.
16	537	This is overall an effective product; although, I've been having a few side effects including very light cramping and continuous spotting, which I hope will wear off.
16	538	The first month I did not have a period and I had two light periods per month after that, however, I did not have any cramping.
16	539	I do get normal PMS symptoms, light cramping and body aches, just no bleeding.
16	540	Though it worked good after about 5 months of taking it I began getting migraines and feeling tired all the time and cramping a little more so I'm switching off it, but it was good for me for a while I really liked it!
16	541	I normally have really horrible periods that last 7-9 days with heavy bleeding, immobilizing cramping, and sometimes nausea.
16	542	Otherwise, I have 2 day periods with no cramping, perfect skin, and no mood swings!
16	543	I love this pill, I never get my period and every month experience very little cramping.
16	544	I bled lightly first 2 days of my period and now I am bleeding heavy for 3 days with bad cramping and back aches.
16	545	Well i have been on this medication for about 5 months so far i been loving it periods have decrease so is cramping .
16	546	The pill does decrease any cramping or nausea I had previously.
16	547	(They were extremely heavy with bad cramping, had to change my super plus tampon every hour) Now, after being on it for 6 months, I've only had spotting as my period.
16	548	My periods only lasted from 3-4 days with VERY little cramping.
16	549	For me I would have to say the only bad part is that I get cramping.
16	550	But I'm still in pain, and cramping and most of all I'm still bleeding.
16	551	Pros: Minimal cramping.
16	552	No more tampons or the resulting cramping.
16	553	I experienced extreme fatigue/dizziness and normal period like symptoms; heavy bleeding, painful cramping and bloating when I wasn't supposed to be having a period.
16	554	My first period lasted 3-4 days and I did experience some cramping on the first day.
16	555	First and second month, spotted for about a week, then got actual period, for a total of about 10 days bleeding, granted it was lighter, but still had some cramping.
16	556	My periods are 2-3 days (mostly spotting) and light cramping.
16	557	Last year, after being on a brand of birth control pill for 20 years with light, predictable and short periods, I began to have breakthrough bleeding, horrible cramping and bleeding.
16	558	Lo Loestrin was the third pill my GYN put me on and after a week or so of spotting, light cramping, I haven't had a period since mid-December.
16	559	I am on it for not only birth control, but also to help control mood swings and help out my intense cramping.
16	560	I am underweight and have managed to gain three pounds, my mood swings were much less severe, and I did not even take any pain killers for my cramping this month at all.
16	561	The first month I started Lo Loestrin Fe was a bit rocky as I had a 2 week period, but since then I have had either VERY light periods or no periods at all, and little to no cramping (which before was a BIG issue with me) the only things that might possibly be a negative for me is I've gained about 6 lbs but most of that went to my breasts so no complaints there, and the cost is ridiculous as my insurance doesn't cover it.
16	562	Its cleared my face, no weight gain (if anything I've lost a couple of pounds), I have tons of energy, my periods last two days now with no cramping and I don't bleed much, my sex drive is through the roof and its actually making sex feel 10x's better than it used to!
16	563	My cramping was horrible ever since I first started my period at 10.
16	564	I have been on this pill for 7months now and in the first few months I experienced very bad headaches and bloating but very little cramping.
16	565	They come randomly each month, however, I get slight cramping the day before to warn me.
16	566	The only positive is that my period started as soon as I went to the white pills and wasn't heavy or crampy.
16	567	I have endometriosis so my doctor recommended this BC to reduce the possibility of getting more ovarian cysts, to stop spotting between periods and to get rid of painful periods.
16	568	Everything went fine spotting wise and I actually got a period on the designated "period pill" days.
16	569	Within the second week of starting the pill I was spotting, which turned into a full blown cycle over the course of two and a half weeks.
16	570	I noticed spotting through out the entire year.
16	571	At first I would only get spotting from month to month.
16	572	Two weeks after starting this birth control I noticed a huge increase in appetite (causing me to gain weight), I had mood swings, spotting, and fatigue.
16	573	I've still been having some spotting still 5 months in, but that's my only real complaint.
16	574	The only side effects that I have experienced are that my boobs have gotten bigger (which is good) and I have experienced spotting.
16	575	The first month I developed extreme constipation and spotting that was manageable.
16	576	I rather have sanity and endure five days of bleeding from my period rather than two weeks of straight heavy spotting.
16	577	I started spotting and spotting more as the months went by then bam, one month I just never had them.
16	578	My periods stopped and I only had some spotting the first month or so.
16	579	It made my periods VERY light, usually lasting less than one day of bleeding, and one day of light spotting.
16	580	Even in the beginning my symptoms were mild besides the usual spotting.
16	581	I was probably spotting for 2 months STRAIGHT.
16	582	Not just spotting either.
16	583	The only time it was spotting was for the 7 days when I was supposed to get my period each month, the rest of the time was HORRIBLE heavy bleeding.
16	584	I've had large blood clots and spotting.
16	585	I'd rather have my 12 day heavy periods than constant headaches, huge blood clots and spotting.
16	586	I never have spotting but had constant discharge the entire month I was on it.
16	587	I'm writing this at 5am when I should be sleep because I'm on the last day of the pill and spotting has gotten worse.
16	588	I've tried the shot, nuva ring, ortho tricyclen, seasonique, so many birth controls and each one caused spotting or bleeding every single day over about 2 years unless I was not on a pill.
16	589	Then spotting for 4-6 days during my last week.
16	590	It was the first month of taking it for me so the most blatant side effect was all the spotting, and having 2 periods in 1 month (and then getting a wild rage moodswing on the 2nd one that lasted about 2 days lol).
16	591	I had some spotting between periods, not much, but some.
16	592	The spotting went away after a month or two and the fatigue went away after about 2/3 months.
16	593	Took for 3 months and it took that long for the spotting to subside.
16	594	No spotting, nothing.
16	595	Like others said, I've had random spotting here and there that gets annoying, I have definitely noticed breast tenderness and swelling (I've always had bigger breasts, lost some weight last year and was finally down to a smaller cup, only to now be back to a somewhat bigger size).
16	596	I start spotting a week into my period every month (on it 3 months now) and have to wear a liner at all times.
16	597	Horrible mood swings, no sex drive (the dark brown spotting all month doesn't help), and is barely covered by birth control.
16	598	For the first couple months I didnt notice any side effects, but now after having taken it for almost 8 months and reading these other reviews I'm realizing that the 15 lbs in weight gain, (abnormal) emotional breakdowns, mood swings, underarm/face cysts, hair loss, brown spotting, tiredness, etc.
16	599	I had severe headaches, dizziness, constant spotting etc but I waited it out.
16	600	I had spotting within the first couple months, but besides that no complaints!
16	601	So that being said, I cannot attest to how it affected my periods other than I did not have any spotting, etc.
16	602	I went on this BC because I do not get regular periods, usually just random light spotting.
16	603	I'm hoping the bleeding will stop since higher dosages normally mean less chances of breakthrough bleeding or spotting.
16	604	I had some spotting in a month 2 but that has stopped as well.
16	605	I like Lo Loestrin, however, I don't love it because the spotting between periods has not stopped.
16	606	I'm hoping the spotting goes away.
16	607	Only "issue" is some minor spotting for about 9 days.
16	608	I'm hopeful the spotting will stop and I'll be back to "normal" soon!
16	609	I just finished my first pack and the only two side effects I experience were spotting (1 for about 4 days and was almost full on bleeding, and the 2nd was only about 2 days and was very light) and weight gain.
16	610	I'm hoping the weight gain/ bloating and spotting subsides in the next 3 months of me trying this birth control but other than that it seems to be just at sufficient as any other birth control I have used.
16	611	I had minor spotting the second week and light spotting during the two white pills so far.
16	612	I have had no bleeding besides when I slip up and forget to take my pill, besides some very light spotting at the end of my pill cycle which I almost don't even notice it most of the time.
16	613	I was fine up until the half year mark until I had spotting for 12 days before getting my real period 4 days late.
16	614	Its just the darn spotting that irritates me.
16	615	I also got spotting during my third weeks of taking it.
16	616	I may get spotting every couple months for 2 days, but that's it.
16	617	First couple months virtually no period to speak of but 5-7 days of mid-cycle breakthrough bleeding..not spotting.
16	618	my period was only 2-3 days of spotting and that was it though I don't know that my cycle normally being 30 days instead of 28 had a part to play in this.
16	619	The first week I was just spotting.
16	620	I switched pills 2 days ago and I'm still spotting because of LoLo.
16	621	I'm hopeful my new birth control will get the spotting to stop soon.
16	622	Sure, i've had breakthrough bleeding and spotting but that's because in the past, I have not been 100% thorough taking it.
16	623	I also experienced a little bit of spotting in the beginning but haven't had a period for years.
16	624	I have experienced no spotting, no reduced sex drive, or weight gain so far and the pain is gone.
16	625	Was on depo but it made my anxiety worse and I gained a lot of weight.. Been on lolo for a month now and no bad side effects except a little irregular spotting!
16	626	I had some spotting initially, but my body seems to have synced up to this medication rather nicely!
16	627	I'm taking these pills for almost 2 months and I have spotting almost non-stop.
16	628	I will stop taking LoLo if my spotting will not stop by the end of second pack
16	629	Besides the frequent spotting I experienced during the first 2 months, I have no complaints!
16	630	The first 3-4 months I had random spotting and a period right in the middle of the pack.
16	631	Unfortunately, about 9 months ago I started getting 2-3 days of spotting in the middle of the month, which wasn't such a problem..
16	632	Unfortunately, the past 2 months the spotting has been more like a full blown heavy period.
16	633	No break outs and no long lasting spotting.
16	634	A few days after I started taking Lolo I started to bleed, I chalked this off as being spotting that some people experience (which I have never had before).
16	635	I also have dark brown spotting every month probably a week after my period and that lasts another week.
16	636	After month one, around the time of the two brown inactive pills, I only had very light spotting, but only one small panty liner for one day was enough.
16	637	I've had terrible mood swings, cry at the drop of a pen, overly sensitive, I've CRAMPED every single day and have had brown spotting like my periods coming since I started the pill, and loss of appetite.
16	638	Within the first few days I was spotting lightly then by day 7 I was HEAVILY bleeding.
16	639	I have a little spotting about once a month.
16	640	The main reason I love this pill because no more periods, I barely have spotting I love it!
16	641	During the first month of taking this pill I kept spotting for about 2 weeks until my actual period came.
16	642	As for the spotting, I no longer am getting it, so that's good.
16	643	I started this pill when I got my period about 2 weeks ago, but since have had spotting literally every single day.
16	644	But other then the spotting I love it!
16	645	No spotting, my period was only two days on the exact date it was supposed to be on.
16	646	The only negative aspect that I didn't like was that I had spotting in between periods on the third pack (the one I'm on now) which made me nervous since I didn't get that the first two months.
16	647	I had a bit of spotting the first month and had to use liners but that went away.
16	648	I had massive mood swings and 1 week of spotting.
16	649	For about the next 3-4 months, I had irregular periods with spotting here and there.
16	650	The first month I had spotting and a normal period.
16	651	The second month I had light spotting and an extremely light 2 day period.
16	652	I tried it for 4 months, waiting for the bleeding and spotting to stop, despite making sure every day I took the pill at the exact same time.
16	653	Besides the non-stop spotting, I also found my libido affected.
16	654	The first month I had spotting for 3 weeks and was quite emotional (can't specifically relate that to the birth control though - could have been caused by other factors).
16	655	It has made me have spotting but I haven't really experienced anything else.
16	656	Took Lo Loestrin Fe for about 18 months - during the first month or two I experienced some spotting and bleeding between periods, but after that my period stopped completely.
16	657	So far I haven't gotten  a real period, but rather several short brownish spotting.
16	658	Have been on it for about a month and no spotting.
16	659	I either have light spotting or no period.
16	660	I did experience some spotting in the very beginning, and when I started my 4th pack I got my period 2 weeks early which was surprising since I'm so used to having a regular period.
16	661	Only problem is I haven't had a period in the 2 years I've taken this, not even spotting.
16	662	Period is pretty normal with only spotting on the last week.
16	663	Third month had very little spotting for 4 days, and I'm about to end the fourth pack.
16	664	I personally enjoy not having a period to worry about every month, instead just light spotting every 2-3 months.
16	665	The only down fall is I have been spotting a little bit, and my breasts are tender/ my mood is a little off the week before my period.
16	666	They are truly effective I don't suffer from spotting or periods and I don't have to worry about getting pregnant.
16	667	I think the only annoyance is that my period comes every other month and that I get some spotting off and on throughout the month.
16	668	For the first time in my life I have no bleeding other than occasional spotting every couple of months.
16	669	The first month, I had minor spotting on one day, no big deal.
16	670	Started with spotting during the second week, developed anxiety attacks and unnecessary fears, back pain, lo libido.
16	671	Hitting my 3rd month on it, no periods or spotting at all.
16	672	I no longer bleed each month, it's more like occasional spotting for a few days.
16	673	I have light spotting or no period at all each month.
16	674	Then the next day I started spotting.
16	675	Light period that just resembled spotting.
16	676	It's great, after the first month no more cyst symptoms, my period which has been heavy (Super tampon had to be changed every 2 hours or flooding would occur) is now down to extreme lite spotting on the last 2 pills only.
16	677	The first and second pack have both caused spotting and my first period was a regular period of 5 days.
16	678	I hope the spotting goes away and I have less bleeding for my period or none at all.
16	679	I did have some spotting throughout the first pack though.
16	680	I did have spotting the first 2 weeks then it stopped.
16	681	I don't have any spotting between periods, my sex drive is in overload so it doesn't dry you out or anything.
16	682	My reason for originally getting it in was to regulate my periods, since I was spotting for weeks straight before.
16	683	I just started my second pack and I haven't had any side effects besides some breast tenderness, and when I first started taking it (I started the first day of my period) I had some light spotting for about 4 days after my period ended.
16	684	I will have been on it for a month on December 25. about a week and a half into the pill I noticed pink discharge that turned into a week or two of spotting.
16	685	I noticed December 8 that I got pinkish discharge that turned into a week of spotting.
16	686	I definitley get very emotional and in my first 3 months had basically constant spotting but now since then I haven't gotten spotting or period bleeding and it's been about 4 months, it practically eliminated my period completely besides some symptoms like bloating.
16	687	After some spotting in the first few weeks, I have had very little unscheduled bleeding, which is one of the more bothersome side effects I've experienced with other oral contraceptives.
16	688	I just want a couple of weeks without spotting or full on bleeding.
16	689	I have been on the pill for probably the past 3 years and I started with regular Loestrin and I had the worst symptoms nausea, mood swings and irregular spotting.
16	690	I consistently got spotting every 2nd week and felt sluggish with little sex drive.
16	691	The spotting was extremely irritating and sometimes I would not have a period at all, which in a way is nice but is also concerning when you are relying on it to tell you whether or not you are pregnant.
16	692	I have had no problems on it whatsoever: no spotting, no exhaustion, no headaches and my sex drive is back.
16	693	First month I had spotting for a couple of weeks, but by the 2nd pack it all went away and my periods are around 3 days and LIGHT.
16	694	No spotting either.
16	695	I continued to bleed after my period had stopped and at day 10 the spotting had ended.
16	696	After 1 full week of the pills I had no spotting, but on week 3 I have started again unfortunately.
16	697	I did notice that my period was a lot lighter and I had some spotting.
16	698	It's been a second month now, and the spotting is gone and my sex drive is back and the period was very short, so I'm satisfied.
16	699	At first I had a lot of random bleeding and spotting the first month.
16	700	Third month I had lighter spotting.
16	701	I am towards the end of my third month on Lo Loestrin Fe and I'm wearing a pad for spotting half the month still.
16	702	I'm not really sure when the spotting stops and the period begins.
16	703	December I got my period on time, again it was light and short, and then january I didnt get my period but had really really light spotting for 1 day and my doc said that WAS my period.
16	704	The 5th and 6th month I had a lot of weird spotting and my period was only 2 days long.
16	705	This month is my 7th month on the pill and I had a little bloating and a headache but no period and no spotting.
16	706	I have had spotting [brown-ish color] for three weeks after my period, but that's normal for the first month.
16	707	On my first packed I had spotting on my 3rd week, then a very light period.
16	708	I have not had any spotting on the second pack and my period is VERY light.
16	709	I have no random spotting or bleeding and it does not make me sick.
16	710	I just finished the first pack and had barely any spotting.
16	711	Actually super light spotting started last Sunday.
16	712	The only down fall is I've been spotting this whole time, which is a pain since I just recently started a new relationship!
16	713	I have been taking Lo Loestrin Fe for 2 months now and have only had one week of no spotting.
16	714	During month one I had non-stop spotting for two weeks straight (not fun for just starting a relationship).
16	715	I didn't like the spotting and the depression I felt from it.
16	716	I am just entering my 3rd week of pills and I am bloated and have started spotting.
16	717	Now my gynecologist switched me to this brand and it has made me gain a ton of weight, makes me spot constantly, and extremely sad to the point people are becoming worried.
16	718	By the time I woke up my period had started and I proceeded to spot for the next week despite religiously continuing to take my pill at the exact same time.
16	719	Not even a spot.
16	720	I was very nauseous at first but did not spot at all.
16	721	No side effects for me at all, and the best part - I haven't had a period the entire time I've been on it (I'll spot very lightly for 2 days out of the month and that's it).
16	722	I cry A LOT...and I have weird pains in my breasts in the same spot that never seem to go away.
16	723	The 5th month I started to spot 10 pills in and I haven't stopped since.
16	724	Then I would spot for two weeks at a time and that got annoying.
16	725	Here and there I will spot for less than a day.
16	726	Now I spot for 1 maybe 2 days a month on the white/brown colored pills.
16	727	The only other times I spot are if I'm careless about taking it at the same time every day.
16	728	I will occasionally spot, but it will only last a day or two.
16	729	It's normal to spot a little on the last week of the pack.
16	730	I did spot for two months but just a tiny bit.
16	731	My period spotted for a few days the first month and I didn't have a period the remaining months.
16	732	I have been on this pill for 3 months first two months spotted non stop and periods were 7 to 9 days.
16	733	I spotted the next two months as well, and my period stayed at the 7-8 day length.
16	734	On this pill I spotted for about the first 15 days then nothing.
16	735	I spotted and got my period multiple times within the first 3 months, way more than normal.
16	736	Week 2 after my period I spotted for like two days.
16	737	First three months I spotted almost everyday, then about the fourth month it leveled out...and then I started getting my period twice a month.
16	738	The 2nd month I spotted for 14 days straight.
16	739	Initially I spotted for a good two weeks and when I did get my period it lasted few days and was into the next month of pills already.
16	740	My period itself was 4 days longer than usual and I spotted for a week and a half before having another full-size period.
16	741	I haven't spotted but have had unusual brown discharge.
16	742	Lolo cleared my skin, I never spotted after taking it- I am very good at taking it at exactly the same time everyday.
16	743	The second month of pill, only spotted about 3-4 days.
16	744	My 1st month (Nov) I started taking it on 16th during my period , it lightend it by 3 days-- a week after, I spotted lightley for 2 weeks straight (nothing serious or worrisome).
16	745	This raised my bp from my normal 115/75 to 145/90, thus giving me a month long headache before I figured it out.
16	746	My side effects included depression and general feeling of sickness: headache and extreme nausea.
16	747	I've now had a headache for almost 6 weeks straight, most days are so bad that I have to take Excedrin or Ibuprofen, I'm anxious most of the time, not sleeping well - and now it's gotten to the point where my coworkers and family are noticing.
16	748	For one, the first few weeks I had a headache every single day, I had no sex drive, and my period last 7 days  .
16	749	My dr decided to switch me to this bc just to try a different kind because I had a headache every period.
16	750	The headache started the day after taking it.
16	751	Hopefully by my fourth month my periods will be back to normal), breast tenderness every day (but not too painful) and occasional headache.
16	752	The difference is I consistently have a headache this time that I didn't have before.
16	753	I was half expecting the nausea and headache, but it never did come.
16	754	I also have a little bit of bloating in the belly but no big weight gain and sometimes I get a bad headache an hour after taking it.
16	755	No weight gain (which happened on every other pill I've tried), no moodiness, just a headache every now and then.
16	756	Also the headaches are terrible.
16	757	I also experienced strange sensations in my arms and legs like weakness and shoots of pain and also experienced headaches.
16	758	It gives me extreme headaches.
16	759	The headaches are all day too.
16	760	I'm taking it at night, so I don't know if there are any headaches or nausea, I don't have any during the day.
16	761	I've been on this pill for almost 2 months and it's given me horrible headaches.
16	762	I never get headaches.
16	763	The first couple months were full of nausea, headaches, sadness, and anxiety.
16	764	Constant headaches and brain fog became the norm for me, as well as nauseousness and abdominal pain.
16	765	I also receive random headaches.
16	766	Constant headaches and the nauseous is unbearable.
16	767	I also get random headaches and I thought it was from a cold but now I'm sure it's the pill.
16	768	I started off on Microgestin Fe  1/20 , and I was fine dealing with side effects, such as minor anxiety, headaches, bloating, mood swings, increased appetite, mind fog, assuming it would go away and it was normal, until week 2.
16	769	I have a history of aural migraines, so any birth control with estradiol in it is a little more dangerous (which is essentially all of them), but with this I have noticed a HUGE reduction in headaches and complications with my vision during them.
16	770	I also have really bad headaches and felt nauseous everyday so far.
16	771	I experienced fatigue, bloating, headaches, stomach aches, and gained 10 lbs.
16	772	No nausea, headaches, bloating, mood swings at all.
16	773	Gained weight, very moody, my face and back broke out bad (which I usually never have), very tender breast, frequent headaches, tired.
16	774	But I've had headaches and anxiety, and really sad, sad, days.
16	775	I commonly get headaches and it has been reduced after changing to this brand.
16	776	I didn't experience nausea or headaches so that was nice.
16	777	A few mood swings and headaches, but I figured my body needed time to get used to it.
16	778	2nd month - felt nauseous at times, slight headaches.
16	779	I'm so emotional I can cry at any second over the smallest things and I get headaches all the time.
16	780	The 1st month, I had headaches, breast tenderness and nausea.
16	781	I heard it can increase frequency of headaches and I have had a couple more here and there, but I'd say that's probably just me not drinking enough water.
16	782	Other than mood swings and headaches, this BC experience is bliss.
16	783	I've not had an symptoms besides breast tenderness and headaches occasionally.
16	784	Noticed no weight gain with this pill, no mood swings, no headaches, this has improved my skin and is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy, just be sure to set an alarm & take it at the same time each day (I take mine at 10pm) before I go to bed.
16	785	Took it for 3 months and never got my period (I'm not pregnant) I always feel sick and exhausted after a long day a lot of headaches and dizziness.
16	786	I was on depo and it made me sick and fat, NO sex drive and vaginal dryness, but now im on Lo Lo and i love it..No weight gain,No headaches, No backpain and joint pain very short light periods and I have a pretty good sex drive now.
16	787	I've had more headaches, and migraines than usual.
16	788	In 1 month I have gained 7 lbs, I am extremely emotional (I broke down crying watching a cooking show for goodness sake), constant heart burn, bad headaches every other day, can't sleep, I am thirsty constantly...the list goes on.
16	789	I also have not experienced any weight gain or headaches!
16	790	I started taking this pill and at first it was okay but it's the third week and I get so dizzy and I'm so depressed and my headaches are horrible !!!
16	791	I was never able to take "the pill" due to side effects of nausea, headaches and other issues.
16	792	I do not feel sick or have any headaches.
16	793	This past month, though, I've started to notice a lot of nausea and some headaches.
16	794	I had my period for 2 weeks straight, mood swings, headaches, dizziness etc.
16	795	On the negative side, I constantly have unbearable headaches and I have absolutely no sex drive.
16	796	I woke up feeling hungover every morning, headaches, dizziness.
16	797	I do experience headaches when stressed and excessive discharge as a side effect.
16	798	I started Lo Loestrin Fe 3 weeks ago, and so far have had a great expierence on it, no weight gain,(Ive actually lost 3 lbs) and if anything my moods are alot better, no nausea, no headaches.
16	799	Other than that my experience has been positive - a little random mid month bleeding but no side effects such as headaches, weight gain, mood changes etc.
16	800	With this pill, I've only gotten a little moody/emotional, rather bloated and a few headaches....
16	801	The first couple weeks of taking it I had really bad headaches and I've gained maybe 2 lbs, my weight does change from time to time anyway!
16	802	Also experienced headaches in the first week or so, but nothing serious.
16	803	Constant headaches, muscle aches and spasms and my period was HORRIFIC.
16	804	I did have recurrent headaches during that period as well however, they've diminished in occurrence.
16	805	At first I experienced light bleeding and headaches.
16	806	I feel tired, having diarrhea, and headaches.
16	807	My weight is pretty much the same and I didn't get sick or have headaches.
16	808	I have also noticed having intense headaches, I'm not sure if its from the birth control, but i've never had them like this before.
16	809	The worst thing I find about this pack is that it makes me more emotional and increases my headaches.
16	810	We both tend to feel tired at the end of most days, headaches and the nausea as well with the light-headedness seem to be the worst.
16	811	I did not gain any weight but I would occasionally have headaches.
16	812	I have noticed some headaches but I usually get those around that time of the month.
16	813	So far everything has been great with the exception of headaches every now and then.
16	814	I NEVER had a migraine until I started taking this pill.
16	815	I've had a migraine every day since I've started taking it and the nausea is getting unbearable!
16	816	I've had a migraine everyday almost and I feel like I'm losing weight as well.
16	817	Mood swings, insane food behavior, migraine, weight gain, no sex drive—it was horrible.
16	818	I am a migraine sufferer and have seizures, it was super hard to get me a birth control that I like (I've tried 7 other types).
16	819	Then I tried Nuvaring where everything was fine until I got my first migraine.
16	820	I have horrible migraines.
16	821	Horrible horrible mental side effects, dizziness and nausea, abdominal pain, HORRIBLE migraines to the point of going to ER for pain control.
16	822	I was switched from Trinessa to this pill due to an increase in migraines which I've struggled with in the past.
16	823	I have migraines anyway, but this is just pushing it over.
16	824	Around the time I started having a period mid pack my migraines got out of control & I had them controlled for years.
16	825	Fortunately I have not experienced any mood changes, appetite changes, migraines, etc.
16	826	Later, I was on Minastrin and I started getting ocular migraines.
16	827	I started this pill due to periods that lasted two weeks out of the month and resulted in terrible migraines and anemia.
16	828	It's the first bc pill I ever took to help with irregular periods and pre menstral migraines.
16	829	Although it did help my migraines a LITTLE, my period was worse than it was before and my emotions were going crazy.
16	830	I just started taking this pill to stop menstrual migraines.
16	831	I decided to give this birth control a shot since every other birth control I've tried was too strong and caused me to have migraines.
16	832	I don't experience any side effects like migraines or weight gain or anxiety.
16	833	No periods, no mood swings, migraines are gone, 10 day periods are gone.
16	834	I have severe migraines so it is hard to find a birth control that doesnt make them 10x worse.
16	835	My migraines have almost disappeared since I started this pill!
16	836	Every week I was crying and somedays I had migraines and felt nauseous.
16	837	I had bad migraines on the placebo weeks for the first 2 months on the pill and some moodiness but after that it has been great.
16	838	I get fewer migraines and my skin is clearer.
16	839	The first few days, I had awful migraines -- after that, everything went completely back to normal.
16	840	I do get migraines but that have been getting better and I personaltly lost weight.
16	841	I began to get constant awful migraines, and I don't have a history of migraines.
16	842	I'm having migraines and nausea all day, and bad mood swings.
16	843	I started this pill to alleviate migraines and prevent pregnancy.
16	844	I don't have any breakouts, no migraines,  no weight gain, and I haven't gotten my period once in the seven months I've been on it.
16	845	I switched to Loestrin to alleviate migraines from my last set of pills, and it worked alright.
16	846	It's the only one that hasn't caused migraines for me.
16	847	I had severe migraines when prescribed this medication of up to 3 a week.
16	848	I stopped the Nuvaring and continued to have the worst migraines ever.
16	849	One good thing is that I do not have the weekly migraines that I had on my old birth control (Yaz).
16	850	My doctor recommended I take Lo Loestrin Fe since I suffer from migraines and needed a low dose birth control.
16	851	Other than that I like Lo Loestrin because I get no more migraines.
16	852	They switched me to Lo-Loestrin hoping to get rid of the migraines, mood changes, and weight changes.
16	853	I was on Triphasil and had migraines for years.
16	854	I was put on this by the doctor in March of 2011 and the first month I felt a complete change, no migraines.
16	855	Appetite and sex drive were normal and no weight gain.
16	856	The cons literally made my life a living hell; I started to lose all my hair (a year later and my hair finally looks kind of normal again), I lost my sex drive, I was super prone to UTI's which in turn caused a bladder condition called IC, I gained weight, and the list could go on.
16	857	I had NO SEX DRIVE, I was moody, always crying, gained weight, depressed, etc.
16	858	I do have a lower sex drive though.
16	859	I wondered if my lowered sex drive was a cause of the pill but I recently ended my relationship and realized it was not the pill.
16	860	I've read that a lot of people have lost their sex drive while on this birth-control, but it is the exact opposite for me.
16	861	My skin has stayed clear, my sex drive is normal, and I haven't gained any weight.
16	862	About two-three months in though, I felt like it made me lose my sex drive a lot and had no libido.
16	863	About 3 months into it I started seeing a major decrease in my sex drive, I was extremely moody and depressed, my husband and I fought pretty much on a daily basis... needless to say I stopped taking it after my annual prescription ran out.
16	864	My sex drive was gone.
16	865	The only drawback: low sex drive.
16	866	It caused my periods to stop completely and also my sex drive was GONE.
16	867	My sex drive has also been through the roof, although I did still have a high libido before starting the pill.
16	868	No sex drive either!
16	869	Decrease in sex drive.
16	870	The only negative thing  I noticed is increased appetite and a decrease in sex drive.
16	871	The first month or two, I am very bloated, moody/depressed, no sex drive, and I have a period that lasts 2 weeks.
16	872	However, it continues to have a very negative effect on my sex drive, which seems kind of counter-intuitive for what you want in a birth control medication.
16	873	The only biggest downside is my sex drive is completely gone, sex is often very painful and without my natural lubrication it is hard for me to have sex for the few days after I have it!
16	874	Im going to switch to a slightly higher pill in hopes of a higher sex drive!
16	875	Night sweats due to low estrogen, flat hair, duller complexion, total lack of sex drive, and dry like the Sahara down there due to thickening of cervical mucus.
16	876	It's my first birth control pill and I didn't know what to expect but I read up on the side effects; so far I have experience mood swings, anxiety (which I was already having issues with) the pill made it worst when I do have episodes of it, weight gain (because I seem to crave sweets more often) and lack of sex drive.
16	877	I did lack serious sex drive and was dry as a desert after the 1.5 year mark.
16	878	I've only had one negative side effect- total loss of sex drive.
16	879	I have absolutely no sex drive, to the point where even thinking about sex stresses me out.
16	880	However in the last year or so I have noticed a change in my behavior and sex drive.
16	881	Secondly I noticed my sex drive is gone.
16	882	I realized my sex drive was completely gone.
16	883	The only side effect I have now is a lowered sex drive.
16	884	I've recently become sexually active and think that the pill might be slightly interfering with my sex drive (seeing as it's not very high), but don't know that as a fact.
16	885	My sex drive decreased severely and I became dried up.
16	886	My only complaint is that I've noticed a serious decline in sex drive.
16	887	Haven't lost my sex drive but sometimes experience vaginal dryness which had never been a problem in the past.
16	888	I had mood swings and it killed my sex drive.
16	889	I have ZERO sex drive.
16	890	It took getting off of Lo loestrin to realize it had virtually killed my sex drive completely.
16	891	My sex drive is normal , and I have gained no weight.
16	892	I was a little moody in the beginning but now I am 4mos in and feel normal with a normal sex drive.
16	893	The persisting side effects are that I have a very low sex drive & increased breast sensitivity.
16	894	My face is clear and my sex drive is okay, not like before, but i haven't lost it.
16	895	My sex drive has disappeared.
16	896	Terrible mood swings, depression, bloating, constipation and no sex drive!
16	897	I'm 27 and to have no sex drive is crazy.
16	898	After months on it I started losing my sex drive and becoming extremely moody the first 3 weeks of the pack.
16	899	My sex drive is gone and I'm in my early 30s, it like happened over night.
16	900	My sex drive is GONE like a bird that hit the damn window.
16	901	My sex drive is back!
16	902	My sex drive seems to be about the same, so as of just a week it had no effects over that.
16	903	I'm pretty healthy and wanted to see how this would work and now I've had nausea for about 3 weeks, low sex drive, low appetite.
16	904	So I love the pill for that...but now, the pill is the reason for my dead sex drive.
16	905	The pill has not caused any weight gain or losses, change in attitude or sex drive.
16	906	Now thislovely little pill - destroyed my sex drive within the first 3 months, only positive is that I grew a cup size over night.
16	907	I also noticed my sex drive went down as well as my energy.
16	908	My sex drive is sometimes affected it takes a while for me to get into the mood and my boyfriend is supportive of it.
16	909	My main complaint is that I seem to be much moodier than I've ever been in the past during my period - becoming depressed and I have almost no sex drive.
16	910	I do experience some moodiness, sadness and low sex drive.
16	911	However, the only downside is that my sex drive has decreased quite a bit.
16	912	Slightly reduced sex drive.
16	913	Besides that everything was fine up until the 8th month taking it..my period became irregular I had 0 sex drive and vaginal dryness which was terrible..I also gained some weight on this pill...over all it didn't work for me but that's not to say it won't work for anyone else!
16	914	No change in sex drive or weird emotional mood swings!
16	915	I have absolutely no sex drive (when I went off birth control from January to August last year it was much higher).
16	916	I had little negative change in mood swings and sex drive was average.
16	917	My sex drive was unaffected as well.
16	918	I lowered my sex drive and my emotions were so all over the place, I considered seeing a therapist.
16	919	No sex drive.
16	920	I have gained weight, my chin is constantly broken out, I had absolutely no sex drive and worst of all, my emotions are crazy.
16	921	I haven't taken it in months and I still have days where I feel miserable and my sex drive has not gotten better yet at all.
16	922	The only major, major side effect I've seen is my sex drive go way down and some mood swings.
16	923	I did not experience any weight gain or irregular break outs, and maintained the same sex drive.
16	924	No sex drive issues.
16	925	I have been trying to lose weight and have not been able too while on it and also sex drive has gone down a lot but other than that no side effects and works well
16	926	Ever since I started it I have also had the worst mood swings, crying at everything, been pushing my boyfriend away and it's been effecting our relationship badly, 0 sex drive and severe depression and making my anxiety worse.
16	927	My sex drive is great and energy is as it has always been and my mood is normal as it was before.
16	928	The biggest problem with this bc is my sex drive.
16	929	If anything theres been an increase in my sex drive and I%u2019ve noticed small bumps I may have had on my face clearing easily.
16	930	Just before stopping this pill at nine months I felt like a completely different person- crying over every little thing, everything irritated me, little sex drive, constantly depressed.
16	931	I noticed a decrease in my sex drive as well.
16	932	Still have my sex drive (which the hubby was worried about).
16	933	Sex drive is about the same if not BETTER!
16	934	The biggest downside is definitely the effect on my sex drive--it is nonexistent since switching to this pill.
16	935	Symptoms have lessened but now it seems I am experiencing loss of appetite and sex drive.
16	936	I noticed that my sex drive decreased tremendously.
16	937	I do not have problem with my a sex drive and my weight is the same.
16	938	I went from having sex almost every day to having 0 sex drive.
16	939	After reading many of the reviews on the BC I've concluded the 3 things common in most people are mood swings, depression, and loss of sex drive.
16	940	Losing my sex drive and have been pulling away from my boyfriend.
16	941	The first three months or so I had no sex drive - but it passed so it wasn't a permanent side effect.
16	942	My sex drive is gone through the window.
16	943	Sex drive is down a little, but its a small price to pay to not act like a crazy woman!
16	944	I have no sex drive.
16	945	My sex drive is still very high but I can't do anything about it when I'm continuously bleeding all the time.
16	946	The doc told me I'm "hormone sensitive" because with other brands I would get really dizzy, nausested, tired, moody, bloated and low sex drive... even after trying them out for 3+ months.
16	947	I didn't gain any weight and my sex drive remained the same.
16	948	No mood swings and same sex drive.
16	949	mood swings, weight gain, low sex drive.
16	950	Great news, I didn't lose my sex drive on this pill as I have with others.
16	951	My period is LIGHT and my sex drive has increased.
16	952	I switched to it from Orsythia (which I had been taking for 3 years) because I was having painful periods and my sex drive was gone.
16	953	I don't have any breakouts, my sex drive is normal, and I haven't gained any weight.
16	954	My only complaint is that my sex drive is DEAD when I used to have quite the active libido, which is the only reason I'm thinking of switching birth controls.
16	955	My sex drive is balanced, I have not seen much change.
16	956	Sex drive was non existent.
16	957	The only major complaint I have is that I've had a major decrease in sex drive as well as being very tired in the morning.
16	958	My sex drive is slightly increased, if anything.
16	959	Only drawback has been decreased sex drive, but not enough to make a huge difference.
16	960	I'm always hungry and my sex drive is through the roof.
16	961	I'm sexually active and I find that it does decrease my sex drive.
16	962	Sex drive decreases only little.
16	963	My sex drive and wetness is a bit lower but nothing some lubricant can't fix.
16	964	Moody and decreased sex drive
16	965	Absolutley no sex drive what so ever.
16	966	I just wish I could get my sex drive back.
16	967	I have gained 6lbs in the last 9 days and have no sex drive.
16	968	I do however have a bigger appetite and my sex drive has increased a whole since coming off the Mirena.
16	969	My sex drive was greatly decreased, and I always felt like something was wrong.
16	970	My sex drive has actually increased.
16	971	The first few weeks on the pill I found an increase in breast size as well as an increased sex drive.
16	972	I had a crazy-long period and lost my sex drive and was an emotional wreck.
16	973	She suggested this due to pre-menopause symptoms, heavy monthly bleeding, no sex drive, weight gain and no energy.
16	974	I have energy and sex drive.
16	975	No problems with my sex drive or anything.
16	976	Mood swings have been tremendous, didn't notice a change in sex drive.
16	977	But, also had all the side effects - always being tired, weight gain, no sex drive.
16	978	I have been a bit concerned because my sex drive is also low.
16	979	In the past I have had insane mood swings, random periods that last for months, serious weight gain, headaches/nausea, extremely low sex drive, etc.
16	980	for around 5-10 yrs) lowered my sex drive and gave me other weird side effects.
16	981	My sex drive has shot up the roof rather than decreasing.

16	1231	I had some nausea along with the changes in appetite but nothing too major.
16	1232	After switching to Lo Loestrin Fe I started experiencing a slight loss of appetite and some nausea, which made me lose 25lbs that I had put on as a result of the Implanon.
16	1233	I could do without the nausea, but I'm pleased with the weight loss, especially because I was expecting to gain weight if anything.
16	1234	I took another brand (with higher does) before but it caused a lot of negative side effects including fainting, night blood pressure and nausea.
16	1235	However I still had the pms symptoms like nausea and pain.
16	1236	I also had nausea and felt really hungry.
16	1237	Alesse was the only one that almost worked for me, and I was on it for two years, but I never really got over the nausea and the mood swings.
16	1238	There were a couple moments of nausea and sore boobs within in the first couple months, but that's pretty normal.
16	1239	I was on Lo Loestrin FE years ago and did not notice too many side effects except nausea and some breakthrough bleeding.
16	1240	I am now peri-menopausal and am taking this instead of HRT but it has caused months of steady nausea, pain in my lower back, extreme breast tenderness and even terrible gas!
16	1241	Only note nausea and upset stomach the first month of starting, but already passed, that and a bit blurry sight.
16	1242	In addition, I would nausea throughout the day.
16	1243	Originally on Yaz, then BeYaz, but realized after stopping BC all together that it was causing me to have ongoing nausea, tiredness and fluid retention issues, so Dr. mentioned I might have estrogen sensitivity I didn't experience any side effects in the first month of taking this BC at all, my mood was better, period was light, and I was able to lose almost 25lbs (was at 175lbs) following the same diet & exercise plan I had been on while on BeYaz.
16	1244	I have experienced NO mood swings, heavy bleeding, head aches, nausea or vomitting.
16	1245	I didn't have any mood swings or nausea.
16	1246	This BC ruined me, nausea, leg pain, anxiety and depression.
16	1247	The 1st month was completely symptom free, but the 2nd month has brought some bloating, indigestion, and nausea.
16	1248	I have found, however, that keeping my blood sugar at a normal level keeps the nausea at bay.
16	1249	I was previously on NuvaRing which gave me a yeast infection and on Ortho TriCyclen/Ortho TriCyclen Lo many years ago and experienced morning nausea and severe mood swings constantly.
16	1250	The first month I did have nausea and heartburn but that also subsided.
16	1251	Some tenderness, little nausea, but nothing that I can't handle.
16	1252	My first two weeks I experienced slight nausea, nothing to stop my day.
16	1253	I broke out in mild hives, I had muscle aches, nausea, mood swings the first week.
16	1254	I had almost constant bleeding for about 4 months, and nausea for the first month.
16	1255	I haven't had any other major side effects...a little nausea but that's about it.
16	1256	I have very painful periods that include bloating, painful swelling of my breasts (Normal bra size: 30E to period bra size: 30FF), shooting pains down my legs, constipation, ovarian cysts, nausea, etc.
16	1257	When I first started, I had pregnancy symptoms for about the first week: sore breasts, nausea, etc.
16	1258	The only problem I have experienced is horrible nausea, I am hoping for it to pass soon.
16	1259	She has been sick more days than I can count, not sleeping well, lost 10 pounds, gets lightheaded often, nausea usually in the evening as well as moody.
16	1260	I would suggest taking this pill at night to combat nausea during the first month.
16	1261	I occasionally experience nausea, fatigue and irritability but nothing that interferes terribly with my life.
16	1262	VERY bad experience, I was sick for a whole week straight with heavy bleeding and nausea.
16	1263	Helped with the endometriosis pain but had constant nausea and severe leg pain that was debilitating to the point of going to the ER.
16	1264	Not to mention the nausea, and weight that I cannot seem to shake no matter how hard I try to shake it.
16	1265	The only positive effect I have experienced while taking this pill is no severe nausea.
16	1266	The only side effect I had was some nausea, but that went away after a few days.
16	1267	Regardless, I am going to wait it out as I'm thrilled not to have any nausea or intense mood swings.
16	1268	I’m also having mood swings pretty badly and am nauseous all the time.
16	1269	The first week of taking this pill I was a little nauseous.
16	1270	Roughly a week and a half on this pill, I lost my appetite, felt very nauseous, and became extremely bloated with terrible constipation.
16	1271	I was nauseous CONSTANTLY especially with physical exercise.
16	1272	I would have to sit down from walking because I would get to dizzy/ nauseous from it.
16	1273	The only downside for me was that from time to time I will be nauseous and I did get breast tenderness but overall it was the best one I have tried.
16	1274	I have Been nauseous and my regular bowel movements have become irregular.
16	1275	This pill made me very nauseous, bloated, moody and tired.
16	1276	I have been on this pill for a little over 3 months and I thought it was great at first but after a week on it I started feeling nauseous everyday and so tired.
16	1277	It made me nauseous at random times during the day.
16	1278	After less than a month of being on this medication, I feel extremely weak, tired, cloudy headed and at night- nauseous.
16	1279	In week 3, I woke up so nauseous that I almost threw up for 4 days straight.
16	1280	I'm constantly nauseous, there are times more often now where I have no appetite, everything I eat hurts my stomach and will cause diarrhea.
16	1281	As soon as I started this birth control I became very nauseous and bloated.
16	1282	I'm nauseous every time I make myself eat.
16	1283	I haven't once been nauseous while taking this; I always eat right after I take the pill at the same time every morning.
16	1284	I felt nauseous at times when I first began taking the pill, but that was all.
16	1285	It does make me feel a little nauseous every now and then but nothing too bad.
16	1286	I do get nauseous through out the day but its bearable.
16	1287	I was even nauseous and sometimes had two periods in one month.
16	1288	This medication definitely makes you nauseous.
16	1289	I feel nauseous nearly every day.
16	1290	I've been on it for about 2 weeks or so now and my main problem with it is that I get a migrane almost every single day now and I feel nauseous every single day and it gets worse at night.
16	1291	The only side effects I've had is breast tenderness and I get a little nauseous from time to time.
16	1292	I sometimes feel nauseous but it goes away shortly after.
16	1293	BeYaz was my last which made me so nauseous, which I never experienced before and constant bleeding.
16	1294	However about 2 weeks into this pill, at least twice a week I started to get dizzy spells to the point I could not walk, etc.
16	1295	If I was not dizzy, then I was totally off balance and it was ALL day long which I have NEVER experienced.
16	1296	Also when I get up I'm very dizzy and easily exhausted.
16	1297	Im 18 and I went from a outgoing weightlifter to a hospitalized so dizzy I can't leave my house depressed individual.
16	1298	I have hot flashes, I sweat like a bloody animal, I'm dizzy, have completely lost my appetite.
16	1299	The first day of using the pill I got very dizzy, threw it up and the experience was horrible.
16	1300	I tried other birth control pills at different dosages but they would make me feel really dizzy and sick.
16	1301	I also experienced dizziness and anxiety that came out of the blue.
16	1302	I didn't know this at first but once I started doing this, I noticed a positive change but still had that mood swing in the third week.
16	1303	My first night, I experienced a severe mood swing.
16	1304	Also, I am not experiencing any mood swings or depression.
16	1305	But I did notice a huge change in my mood swings (so did my family and boyfriend).
16	1306	Mood swings of anger for me.
16	1307	I anticipated hormonal mood swings but literally anything could trigger me from being happy to sobbing or absolutely furious.
16	1308	My mood swings are awful.
16	1309	The only side effects I've had are some mood swings and I literally cried about everything.
16	1310	I have constant mood swings and any little problem or sad situation makes me want to burst into tears and I am generally not a very emotional person.
16	1311	My boobs swelled A LOT and they always hurt, my mood swings are horrendous and to top it off, I bled for 2-1/2 weeks straight.
16	1312	It caused me to have horrible mood swings...it was like I was PMSing the entire month I was on it.
16	1313	I have had zero mood swings--- even near my period, I had break through bleeding the first month and that was it, my periods are already so light and I'm only on the third month, my face cleared right up and has been less oily, I've lost weight...
16	1314	After a few years of not being on birth control I decided I needed to go back on it because the out of control mood swings and irrationality during PMS paired with the completely dibilitating back pain I was experiencing during the first two days of my period were ruining my life.
16	1315	I noticed irritability and mood swings when I first started but thought I got over it after a while.
16	1316	This made mine way worse, I've been suffering anxiety, depression, and bad mood swings since taking this.
16	1317	I have little to no period each month, no mood swings, overall ..
16	1318	Definitely irritability and mood swings.
16	1319	After three days  I started noticing severe mood swings, mostly between irrational anger and despondency.
16	1320	But for the most part my biggest complaint is the mood swings that I'm getting.
16	1321	I am currently having the same side effects and 2 periods a month and so much pain, anxiety and mood swings, and dryness during sex.
16	1322	No bloating, no anxiety, no mood swings.
16	1323	I already have anxiety & this pill made it a million times worse & I about drove everyone as well as myself crazy with my mood swings & attitude.
16	1324	I also took this in a continuous method in order to prevent mood swings and this worked extremely well for me.
16	1325	The first three months of this birth control were a little rough, mood swings and heavy periods.
16	1326	But then I got severe mood swings and emotional states, so bad it was giving me chest pains.So I stopped the pill and anything else vitamin wise I was taking for about 10 months.
16	1327	Well I'm 3 months in, the depression and severe mood swings are all back WORSE than before..so I'm going with that it is the pill!
16	1328	It has also caused my face to break out horribly and awful mood swings.
16	1329	And I had constant mood swings & hot flashes.
16	1330	extremely painful periods with crazy mood swings.
16	1331	My period stopped completely and my mood swings went away.
16	1332	I have also noticed a change in mood- I had terrible pms mood swings and depression and now that's all gone.
16	1333	Seems to have helped alleviate some mood swings and irritability also.
16	1334	My mood swings got so bad that I lashed out in rage at my boyfriend for literally nothing.
16	1335	Sure the first months I got some mood swings and i was very emotional but now my anxiety is being triggered and I have no appetite!
16	1336	Additionally, my mood swings were wild, and I found myself feeling incredibly depressed.
16	1337	I know you are supposed to wait 3 months to let your body adjust to the birth control but it is not worth bleeding for over a week and the mood swings.
16	1338	The crazy mood swings that I developed while on this medication made a huge impact on the way I treated my boyfriend and my family.
16	1339	My biggest issue on this pill was the mood swings and irritability.
16	1340	I have had mood swings ever day starting early in the morning after I take it and lasting until I go to sleep.
16	1341	While on this birth control I've had major mood swings to the point where the people in my house walk on egg shells around me.
16	1342	But after my recent break up because of my mood swings, I am finally acting and getting off this pill to hopefully something better.
16	1343	The only thing is I have some mild mood swings during my Week 3 and Week 4 of the pill and some breast tenderness.
16	1344	Also experienced frequent mood swings, tearing up in the middle of the day/street.
16	1345	It's been great for my body and I've been happy, haven't faced any mood swings!
16	1346	Didn't have mood swings or gain weight.
16	1347	I do not break out, no mood swings also!
16	1348	Not only am I depressed, but my mood swings are not even explainable they are that bad.
16	1349	I honestly feel like Lo has helped my mood swings (probably because I'm not in horrible pain for a week of every month) and I'm much happier with it.
16	1350	No mood swings.
16	1351	I originally switched to LoLo after I noticed that the generic for Notrel 1/35 (Dasetta) was giving me slight mood swings.
16	1352	This pill has caused anxiety, major mood swings and even mild depression; I don't feel like myself at all and have never suffered from depression/major mood swings before this pill.
16	1353	My Dr. suggested to put me on this bc because the other birth control I was on was giving me severe mood swings.
16	1354	The downside to this bc is that at the end of my pack I start to have a few days of mood swings, depression, anxiety and I get overly sensitive about stuff.
16	1355	My skin got slightly better and no mood swings but uncontrollable weight grow is scary.
16	1356	I was having severe mood swings whenever I was on the white or brown pills, anger follow by depression.
16	1357	I haven't had any mood swings or depression but I'm on this to NOT have a period and so far it's not doing what I really wanted it to do
16	1358	I got a lot of side effects as well: stinging eyes, extra sensitive skin, mood swings, soreness, etc.
16	1359	The mood swings just aren't worth it.
16	1360	this was the first form of birth control pill that I have ever taken and it was horrible I had constant bleeding my period was a mess I had constant mood swings and it would be extremely hard for me to get wet during sex I would also get really dry at times while having sex with my partner.
16	1361	I still experience mood swings and I have a lack of energy but overall it's great!
16	1362	I've had really minor mood swings, definitely not as bad as Marvelon (I cried over everything).
16	1363	I do not have anymore mood swings so that's a plus.
16	1364	I have experienced mood swings the first week I start a new month of medication and my boobs have increased in size and one is slightly larger than the other.
16	1365	Other brands gave me massive mood swings.
16	1366	The only downside is that I've been feeling mood swings and depressed while still on this pill and I've only felt this change just this month .
16	1367	First month was awful, with 3 week period and constant crying and mood swings.
16	1368	2days into the second pack, my menstrual stopped, along with the mood swings.
16	1369	I've taken the 10lb off, haven't had an breakouts or mood swings either.
16	1370	I was getting my period twice a month and had awful mood swings.
16	1371	This medicine didn't make me gain weight or give me terrible mood swings, however, it gave me awful dryness "down there."
16	1372	I was having serious mood swings and long periods with other birth control.
16	1373	Since I've switched, no mood swings and no period!
16	1374	My moods are even keel (notice moodiness near the days when you take iron but they are mild compared to the wild mood swings I experienced when I was not on the pill) and I don't get any periods anymore, ever.
16	1375	But seems like small price to pay for no wild mood swings and no periods!
16	1376	It made me crazy with mood swings.
16	1377	I have had NO mood swings.
16	1378	The first month was horrible, with minor breakouts and bad mood swings, but I have adjusted now.
16	1379	Firstly I got my first yeast infection because of it secondly I get the worst mood swings and depression like no other.
16	1380	I had a lot if mood swings and very tender breasts.
16	1381	I also have not had any mood swings in comparison to the ones I had before on the ring.
16	1382	I did have some mood swings in the first month but by the second month I didn't have any.
16	1383	I also always suffered from SEVERE mood swings with other birth control- crying over nothing, bouts of rage, extreme insecurity- but this is so much better.
16	1384	It really helped with my PMS mood swings, which were awful!
16	1385	The only negative side effects that I've experienced are some weird mood swings every now and then.
16	1386	I will say that this pill  caused virtually no mood swings, which is a HUGE plus compared to previous pills I have tried.
16	1387	But then I realized that the mood swings I gave up with lo loestrin would probably just return due to accutane.
16	1388	i started taking lo 5 days ago I have experiences mood swings not severe but just basically feeling weird.
16	1389	I've had no mood swings or emotional/mental side effects.
16	1390	I do have a lot of discharge which is a side effect, no mood swings or anything like that.
16	1391	I noticed that I was having mood swings the first week, it made my period last for about 2 weeks but I know my body's still adjusting.
16	1392	The main reason I started taking it was mainly just to prevent pregnancy, but also to curb my strong PMS mood swings.
16	1393	I work at a gynecology office so I am well aware that the first 3 months of any new birth control can have potentially weird side effects such as abnormal bleeding, mood swings, etc.
16	1394	Terrible mood swings, fatigue.
16	1395	It has helped with mood swings I was having on my old pill.
16	1396	I haven't had any side effects except for mood swings for the first 3 days.
16	1397	The only thing I really hate about this pill is the mood swings.
16	1398	I have the most violent and depressing mood swings for no reason whatsoever, random times of the day.
16	1399	After using Nuva Ring for many years, I all of the sudden developed bad reactions to it (severe mood swings and pain) and began searching for a new birth control.
16	1400	I was experiencing very severe mood swings, depression, etc.
16	1401	I am constantly tired, have stomach pains all the time and I am getting whiplash from my mood swings.
16	1402	I didn't have mood swings although I was freakishly mellowed out.
16	1403	The only thing that I have a problem with is mood swings.
16	1404	I have breast tenderness and mood swings every now and then, then again it's expected for the first few months.
16	1405	If the bleeding and mood swings have not stopped by the time I finish the third pack, I will be switching immediately!
16	1406	During the first two weeks I had severe mood swings.
16	1407	The only side effects I've experienced thus far are breast tenderness, bloating of my breasts, and very little mood swings.
16	1408	Slight mood swings.
16	1409	No periods or crazy mood swings.
16	1410	I used to have constant mood changes, but the pill helped a ton with that.
16	1411	( Mid pack, hormone pills) Mood changes.
16	1412	I haven't had any weight changes or mood changes while on this medication.
16	1413	No mood changes.
16	1414	I haven't noticed any mood changes.
16	1415	I was nervous about starting birth control because of all the side effects you hear about.
16	1416	I can be nervous about taking new meds, but decided to give this a try.
16	1417	I was nervous I may be pregnant again (I am still recovering from the damage and severe weight loss caused by the pregnancy), but she reassured me it is normal to not have periods.
16	1418	I have been on Lo Loestrin for almost 2 months and was extremely nervous, since the last birth control I had been on did not work at all.
16	1419	And I am not sure if the pill is to blame but I have been getting anxious & nervous a lot for no reason lately.
16	1420	I had never been on the pill before this so I was nervous about its effectiveness, but it has been wonderful so far!
16	1421	At first I was very nervous each month, even taking pregnancy tests.
16	1422	I was nervous, but my results have been amazing.
16	1423	It will certainly be a money maker for companies who make pregnancy test - as missed periods make us all a little nervous.
16	1424	I have a history of anxiety and depression, and have been actively working toward losing weight, so I was fairly nervous about starting Lo Loestrin Fe.
16	1425	I was a little nervous at first because this is my first time taking birth control and I've heard all the negative side effects of taking birth control.
16	1426	I was depressed and anxious all the time.
16	1427	I feel very very sad, I  started to get anxious and have meltdowns easily.
16	1428	It was nice not getting it but also made me anxious every month.
16	1429	I had horrible depression and anxiety as well ( i am not a anxious or depressed person) It drove me NUTS!!!!!!!
16	1430	I would get severe panic attacks and break out in shakes and sweats whenever I started feeling anxious, which was daily.
16	1431	Then 2-3 days before the end of the pill I get extremely anxious.
16	1432	Additionally, I began to feel depressed, anxious and even suicidal.
16	1433	I have been the most emotional I have ever been, I cry all the time and get very anxious.
16	1434	While I had no period, crapping, or acne..it caused me to be more anxious than I ever had been.
16	1435	I felt blue, anxious, suicidal, emotional, and emotionally unstable all the time.
16	1436	I have really bad chronic depression & extreme anxiety & this contraceptive doesn't effect my moods whatsoever.
16	1437	Worsened my anxiety and depression , made me so tired could barely do anything all day I felt like I was on morphine.
16	1438	I took this pill after doing some research and seeing if maybe the cause of my severe depression and anxiety was hormonally related.
16	1439	My anxiety has never been so bad.
16	1440	The worst part though was the anxiety and depression.
16	1441	Couldn't get out of bed, and had anxiety attacks.
16	1442	Caused me clinical anxiety and depression out of the blue and made me feel suicidal.
16	1443	However, I just stopped taking it last week and I noticed, I'm assuming after my hormones have started to regulate again that my irritability and anxiety is little to none.
16	1444	Do not use this if you suffer from anxiety.
16	1445	I am conflicted regarding it because it has reduced my anxiety and levelled my emotions wonderfully, but at the cost of having six day periods with only seven days of no period in between the next one.
16	1446	By reading the reviews I found some relief from my anxiety of being pregnant.
16	1447	I was absolutely terrified to go on any type of birth control pill because I find myself prone to side effects with these things and was already having bad anxiety.
16	1448	I feel as though my body actually really needed this, since it seems as though it's actually levelled out my anxiety.
16	1449	I have some anxiety and depression sometimes but what woman doesn't!!
16	1450	I had a panic attack and anxiety so bad, I immediately quit.
16	1451	I have anxiety disorder and this medicine has made it worse and is actually causing depression which according the side effects, is common.
16	1452	Slightly more anxiety but thought it would surpass.
16	1453	More anxiety, more depression.
16	1454	I have a history with anxiety and the pill has slightly elevated it, but it is manageable.
16	1455	About 4 months into the pill I started getting anxiety and very depressed that's when my husband realized that it might be the pills that have my hormones all out of whack &  had me feeling like this so I stopped them .
16	1456	It has given me horrible head aches and anxiety.
16	1457	I was on this pill for just three weeks and noticed a major increase in anxiety and depression.
16	1458	If you have a history of anxiety do not take this pill
16	1459	But it's made my anxiety worse.
16	1460	I have PMDD, and my anxiety has decreased dramatically, along with my panic attacks and other events that were associated with the PMDD.
16	1461	No skin breakout or acne.The women in my family suffer from depression, anxiety and are not able to tolerate OCP's very well.
16	1462	The only minor effect, but tolerable, are: night sweats, I take the pill @9 pm, slight increase in anxiety +slight stomach upset .
16	1463	Add that to the emotions I was experiencing (anxiety, depression, very quick temper) and I stopped taking this after 2 1/2 months.
16	1464	My husband noticed a big change in my moods and anxiety levels on this pill.
16	1465	I have had the WORST luck with birth control over the years and had to completely go off the pill for almost 2 years because of my extreme anxiety I was experiencing.
16	1466	Side affects I've noticed though is I have not felt good, and as I already suffer from anxiety and depression this made it a million times worse.
16	1467	I have bled everyday since starting this pill and have had anxiety attacks (which I have never experienced before).
16	1468	I started taking this birth control, and on the 8th day I had a anxiety attack (something I have never had or experienced in my life) However I was under a lot of stress so that could of been the reason to.
16	1469	No anxiety or depression exacerbation (which was a big worry since I already have them - didn't want this to make it worse).
16	1470	Before using Lolo I've already had an eating disorder, depression and anxiety, and now after using it every single one of them is 100 times worse!
16	1471	Pills caused me to have anxiety at work, but worst of all I had pain and pressure on my chest.
16	1472	Most recently, my depression and anxiety have increased tenfold and gone through the roof.
16	1473	Please be careful if you have a history of anxiety or depression taking this.
16	1474	The first few days I was overcome anxiety but that subsided.
16	1475	Which resulted in a lot of anxiety and pregnancy tests.
16	1476	It's been about 6 weeks since I have stopped the pill and haven't gotten a period, and every few weeks symptoms of anxiety and unnecessary fears come back.
16	1477	It helps my anxiety too.
16	1478	It's pretty normal about a week before my period I would have breast pain.
16	1479	I have not noticed any breast tenderness or any of the other side effects.
16	1480	I have NOT experienced the common symptoms of: breast tenderness, weight change/gain, or bloating.
16	1481	I have a bit of bloating/gas pain and breast tenderness but other than that I am thrilled.
16	1482	I have had major breast tenderness in the first few months of taking it (feels like my boobs were getting bigger and just achy).
16	1483	Under my left arm hurts and breast tenderness.
16	1484	I finally gave lolo a shot and it has been the first pill I've had zero side effects from except some breast tenderness.
16	1485	I didn't have any weird side effects besides breast tenderness.
16	1486	Last week I missed a pill and took it 12 hours late (in the morning), a few days later I was severely depressed and had breast tenderness that lasted 2-3 days.
16	1487	Had breast tenderness.
16	1488	The only side effect I got were breast tenderness and freckles (on my thighs??).
16	1489	The only symptoms I've had was going from a C cup to a D cup, and breast tenderness near my period, which is overall normal for me.
16	1490	The only other complaint I would have is breast tenderness.
16	1491	I have slight breast tenderness sometimes, but nothing major.
16	1492	I've had breast tenderness and I feel like they've honestly gotten bigger in the past 3 weeks.
16	1493	No breast tenderness.
16	1494	Breast tenderness also occurred in the first month or so.
16	1495	The only thing that is a bummer is breast tenderness (especially in the morning) my breast are swollen, but I don't think they will get bigger than my already 34D.
16	1496	No breast tenderness and no weight change.
16	1497	I have increased breast tenderness and have LOST weight.
16	1498	I have used Ortho Tri-Cyclen where I went completely nuts, breast tenderness, moodiness and my hair fell out.
16	1499	Other side effects include (painful) breast tenderness and hunger.
16	1500	Other than the bleeding, I've had mild breast tenderness and some bloating.
16	1501	I've had periods and the only BC related side affect has been tender breasts, which has only started recently.
16	1502	I also get very tender breasts during this time but they have gotten bigger since taking the birth control.
16	1503	The only side effects I had from this was sore breasts and constipation.
16	1504	Only other symptoms I've had are sore breasts, hunger and even though no period I still have PMS before my sugar pills.
16	1505	The first month of taking it, I got a horrible yeast infection that would not go away then a bacterial one.
16	1506	And after EVERY period then on I got a mild yeast infection.
16	1507	I was so sensitive that any little thing would make me have a yeast infection.
16	1508	Also I get yeast infection like every month.
16	1509	I also seem to get a mild yeast infection around the time of my period which, as you can imagine, is awful.
16	1510	I was given Lo Loestrin and I have not had a single yeast infection for 6 months.
16	1511	I switched to Lo Loestrin Fe from another bc that was giving me chronic yeast infections at the start of the pack every month.
16	1512	The chronic yeast infections also returned around the 3 month mark.
16	1513	My gyno said it was probably not the Bc but I switched and after 2 months on the new stuff I was no longer getting yeast infections.
16	1514	Normally I wouldn't complain about a lack of periods, but other side effects I've had include frequent (I'm talking back to back to back) yeast infections and (TMI) vaginal dryness.
16	1515	After being on a rather absurd amount of birth controls in the past 6 years, this was the only one that didn't cause me to have yeast infections.
16	1516	Most obgyn's do not believe birth control can cause yeast infections, but After 30 days of remaining on Lutera and Diflucan, I believe mine was convinced.
17	1	I wanted a contraceptive pill which would control my acne and which would have a lower dosage of hormones as well (I was taking Yaz before).
17	2	With this pill though, I got cystic acne on my forehead, on my temples, on my cheeks, on my chin and on my neck.
17	3	I have an acne-prone skin but I have never had such bad acne than since I started this pill !
17	4	Then cystic acne started popping up and I couldn't control it with anything!
17	5	With the other BC, I was able to control it, and it at least went away like a normal pimple, but this acne is painful and HUGE.
17	6	It cleared my face from acne, I didn't have much to begin with.
17	7	I also started having face/back acne right after starting the pill.
17	8	I love it, no acne, no weight gain, no period...
17	9	I do get acne kinda normally however i broke out so much on my forehead and I'm almost positive it's from this pill.
17	10	My acne did worsen significantly but my dermatologist fixed me right up.
17	11	I was on the Lomedia 24 Fe for one month and during that month I had terrible acne all over my forehead and mood swings - some days I would wake up in a bad mood.
17	12	Some acne but not much more the usual.
17	13	Horrible, horrible, horrible I have never had acne this bad in my life!!!!!!!!!!
17	14	My WHOLE chin and jawline are red and covered in cystic acne!!!
17	15	My face hurts so bad because of the acne.
17	16	My periods are light and I don't get cramps or back aches while on my period and I don't have problems with acne.
17	17	No acne, no mood swings, and my sex drive has increased, actually.
17	18	While I was on the medication, my acne improved, I hardly had any breakouts, I barely experienced cramps, and I had a shortened period.
17	19	The only two plus sides to this drug was that within the first two weeks my mild acne was 100% gone and I did not get pregnant.
17	20	The plus sides I've had are: 1) light periods that usually last only 4 days, 2) I only cramp on the first day usually, but if I do any other time, it's brief and pretty tolerable, 3) I always start at the same time every month, 4) no spotting throughout the month whatsoever, 5) no weight gain, 6) and no acne.
17	21	No horrific acne.
17	22	It helped clear up acne, I have very short, always regular periods, and I didn't experience any weight gain from this pill.
17	23	I've been on three different birth control pills and this is the only one where I haven't gained weight, acne, or cramps.
17	24	It cleared up my acne too.
17	25	No bad acne.
17	26	My acne didn't really change much.
17	27	I never had nausea, but I did have some increase in acne.
17	28	I had no weight gain, hardly any acne or mood swings, and absolutely no cramping.
17	29	I started taking Loestrin 24 to prevent pregnancy, not really knowing that birth control was supposed to clear your acne.
17	30	It was almost like not being on the pill at all, except that I immediately noticed that my generally clear skin was breaking out like CRAZY with really painful cystic acne.
17	31	I assumed it was just an initial breakout and tried to wait it out, but I just recently quit after 4 months because I couldn't handle the horrible acne.
17	32	I did a lot of research and it's progesterone is very androgenic and is known to cause acne.
17	33	Gave me short, light periods but caused terrible acne, headaches, and decreased sex drive.
17	34	My periods were just tiny bits of spotting and my acne cleared up entirely.
17	35	My face and back have developed an acne break-out that my doctor described as the "worst reaction to a birth control" she has ever seen.
17	36	My period which is normally 7 days long, was reduced to 2 to 4 days and it was very light but my acne got so much worse!
17	37	All together it was good for lightening my period but I could not take the acne and the moodiness so I went off of it.
17	38	To my surprise my periods became nonexistent and it also cleared my acne.
17	39	I recently began taking Loestrin 24 again and noticed acne in the first week of taking it, up and down mood swings, and I'm about 5-6 days late on my period...which I am not really worried about since I've experienced that side effect when I took this pill in the past.
17	40	I had terrible acne when starting this pill, it's been 7 months total taking it, my skin is now completely clear.
17	41	I never really had bad acne before but did have frequent breakouts.
17	42	Gives me horrible acne right before and during my period.
17	43	I need one that helps acne because I tend to break out.
17	44	I used to get awful cramps and have horrible acne with the other pills; I don't have this anymore with Loestrin.
17	45	I have not gained any weight from the pill and acne has not been bad at all.
17	46	I got on Loestrin 24 FE for birth control and to help me with my acne.
17	47	My skin (which I've recently had bad acne issues for some reasons) is finally clearing up, I haven't gained a pound, my breasts are growing (thank goodness), and my period is light as a feather and only lasts two to three days.
17	48	As far as my acne I have always had clear skin.
17	49	The pill didn't affect my acne or anything.
17	50	I had little acne and no mood swings (to my knowledge), my breasts did grow almost 2 cup sizes.
17	51	No weight gain, no increase in acne, no sick feeling or anything, hopefully the spotting stops soon!
17	52	I have not gained any weight, my acne cleared up within weeks.
17	53	The only problem I had was light acne or that might just have been me being 15.
17	54	It also has taken me up a bra size and cleared up my mild acne!
17	55	I've never had an acne problem in my life.
17	56	For the last week my face has become covered in acne.
17	57	Previous to the pill, I never had acne problems so that was not an issue.
17	58	Cleared up all the acne on my back and chest, still break out on my face, but that's normal for me.
17	59	I have had no ill side effects, no weight gain, spotting, acne or hair loss.
17	60	But it did make my breasts bigger and it made my acne go away also.
17	61	Also, although acne is 1 of the side effects I find myself having no pimples now (although I'm not sure it would have the same for moderate or severe acne).
17	62	I'm almost done with my second pack and so far I've notice my adult acne is clearing and my breast are getting firmer - which is awesome.
17	63	I thought everything was going well on this pill, until I started getting worse and worse acne.
17	64	I'm 23 years old and my acne is the worst it's been my whole life.
17	65	I'm hoping it will clear up my acne!
17	66	First 3 months I had breakthrough bleeding and mild acne.
17	67	Still have occasional mood swings, but other than that, NO problems with weight gain, acne, hair loss or anything of the sort.
17	68	I used to have horrible acne that nothing would cure, but the pill has cleared almost all of it up.
17	69	The acne did get worse for me at first, but it takes time to work.
17	70	My acne is almost gone and I had terrible acne.
17	71	Otherwise I have lost weight and my acne is way better.
17	72	I'm only 17 years old and i got on the pill for acne and very irregular periods.
17	73	I still have terrible acne and my periods haven't been light and regular every month.
17	74	I took Loestrin Fe 24 for 8 months, and while my acne certainly improved and my period was lightened, that's about the only compliments I can give this medicine.
17	75	I have been on Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Yaz and Necon and they all made me depressed, horrible mood swings (always angry at the world), weight gain,and did not help with the acne.
17	76	I have no other side effects for now, no acne, no weight gain.
17	77	Lighter/shorter periods and could possibly be the reason why my acne has cleared.
17	78	Tiny bit of weight gain, no acne and almost no period, they only last about 2 days.
17	79	I have been on this pill going on 3 months now so far I have only seen an increase in acne and weight by a slim margin.
17	80	It has not helped my acne, though.
17	81	No period, no weight gain, and no increased acne.
17	82	It took care of my periods/cramps like it was supposed to, but it didn't really take care of my acne.
17	83	I love it because it helped with my acne and I used to get real bad cramps and heavy bleeding up to five days, but after three months on this pill I didn't mind being on my period.
17	84	In the past two months I started to get really bad acne and not to mention I now have insomnia.
17	85	I never got acne, but after starting this pill I noticed a few spots-nothing big, maybe 5 or 6 over the course of 2 months.
17	86	I don't have acne anymore.
17	87	With Loestrin my acne has not broken out, it actually helped me with that.
17	88	No acne, weight gain, or anything else I've noticed.
17	89	The only problem I have had with this pill was mild acne.
17	90	I've never had acne breakouts in my life.
17	91	I have had no side effects, my skin has actually cleared up (I have cystic acne), I have a period that literally lasts a few hours and the only cramps I have are mild and last for less than an hour.
17	92	To be completely honest, I have never had an issue with acne so I can't really express whether or not it has helped in that manner.
17	93	It helped clear up my acne, never caused weight gain, stopped my cramps, and I don't get nearly as moody.
17	94	After taking this pill for 2 cycles, I was acting irrational, having mood swings, night sweats, severe acne and other menopausal symptoms.
17	95	As far as birth control, I haven't been having sex, and I never had bad acne to begin with.
17	96	Got terrible acne.
17	97	Can't decide if I want to switch to something that will increase my cup size even just a little and not cause acne.
17	98	I've been on this about 3 weeks and have had horrible mood swings and terrible acne.
17	99	I'm 30 years old and haven't had acne issues for 10  years, but I'm breaking out like crazy since taking this.
17	100	I have had AWFUL headaches, SEVERE mood swings, spotting every two weeks off and on, and HORRIBLE cystic acne.
17	101	I've really had many acne problems and within a few weeks of taking this birth control, I had huge cysts of acne (two on my face and one on my chest).
17	102	In case, you don't know cystic acne is basically a huge over sized painful pimple that can take up to 6 MONTHS to go away.
17	103	It really helped with my acne.
17	104	I never had any nausea, weight gain, acne, hair loss, or skin discoloration.
17	105	Also, the pill took away all of my acne which is always a plus!
17	106	I have severe anxiety and nervousness, shaking, chest tightness, nausea, I feel so sad at points in the day, my skin is breaking out terribly, my body looks swollen, my throat feels like it is going to close up when I have panic attacks from this stuff.
17	107	During the first two weeks I started breaking out a bit, but afterward, my complexion was completely clear.
17	108	I had few pimples.
17	109	The last pill before my period which was taken two days ago gave me a couple pimples and a yeast infection.
17	110	I do notice more breakouts but nothing ridicuouls just one or two more pimples rather than none.
17	111	I have had no weight change, no headaches, no pimples, no change in sex drive, and nothing else!
17	112	Plus, for some reason, since I started using this b.c., my occasional pimples have disappeared and stopped showing up.
17	113	Doctor switched me from Kariva to Lo Loestrin FE due to migraines with aura and extremely heavy periods/debilitating cramps.
17	114	In fact, my cramps and migraines were horrible.
17	115	Terrible cramps on the first day of each period, my periods were heavier than ever, I bled through 4 super plus tampons a day.
17	116	I had cramps, but not Normal cramps and no where near as painful.
17	117	I also have terrible cramps.
17	118	Periods were incredibly light, like spotting, but with unbearable cramps.
17	119	I take this birth control mainly for cramps, and I've been on it for almost two years.
17	120	Really minor cramps (when my period is about to come).
17	121	My periods are so little its basically only spotting and I no longer have any cramps, which I am thankful for because prior I could barely move in peace with them.
17	122	I was on Loestrin for a year and I loved how light my periods were and how much less my cramps were.
17	123	My periods last for 7-8 days cramps are unbearable and there are time that its heavy its annoying and there are times I cant even sleep.
17	124	I started taking birth control because I was missing school due to cramps, so this was a significant benefit for me.
17	125	My doctor perscribed it as I have excessive cramping that makes me miss work due to such painful cramps I throw up.
17	126	I also could not keep pain medication down so cramps would not go away.
17	127	I had short, 2 or 3 day periods, only minor cramps, no nausea--a huge one for me because I have a sensitive stomach, no moodiness, no weight gain.
17	128	Terrible cramps, headache, even vomiting.
17	129	I do have cramps as a side effect, but they have gotten much better.
17	130	Before Loestrin I would curl up in a ball and cry from the severity of the cramps.
17	131	My periods were awful and cramps were really bad.
17	132	I have mild cramps on my period, and my period usually only lasts about 2-3 days.. and it is also very light.
17	133	Can wear pantyliner when on my cycle and cramps only the 1st day of my cycle.
17	134	Before going on this pill, I had absolutely horrible period cramps, terrible iron deficiency, and very excessive bleeding.
17	135	When I started the pill, my bleeding decreased a ton and I didn't feel lightheaded anymore, I have not had a single pimple since I started it, and cramps are nonexistent.
17	136	My friend had terrible cramps after taking it for about 5-8 months and switched.
17	137	I barely have cramps or bleeding.
17	138	My periods were really light and only 2-3 days and didn't experience any spotting between, minimal cramps if any and my skin cleared up.
17	139	Probably about the second week of my first pack I had abdominal cramps.
17	140	Just like period cramps.
17	141	My period was also shorter and lighter, but my cramps were just as horrible as normal.
17	142	I had very heavy debilitating cramps and periods.
17	143	They are horrible on this pill, bad cramps and nausea.
17	144	I'm talking crippling pain from cramps, to the point where I couldn't go to school for days.
17	145	Except I have more cramps and bloating than not being on the pill, which is odd.
17	146	Before Loestrin I had horrible cramps and while on Loestrin I had mild cramps.
17	147	Didn't get cramps.
17	148	I still have had breakthrough bleeding (more like just spotting) for the last two weeks of every month, but the "period" at the end is practically nonexistent with no cramps, which is great.
17	149	Before this I was on Yasmin, which was absolutely horrible as it made me extremely nauseous, tired, and gave me worse cramps with my period than I had before with a normal period.
17	150	I have not become pregnant, have very light, short periods, and very little cramps.
17	151	I have been on this pill for about a year now, for the first couple months I had mood swings and a week before my period I had pretty bad cramps.
17	152	I have cramps and nausea every day, overly emotional, respiratory problems while laying down, weight gain and bloating.
17	153	I have been on this pill for about 8 months because I had very bad cramps.
17	154	It made the cramps completely go away and my periods only last 3 days.
17	155	However, I have just started spotting virtually everyday and having cramps.
17	156	I had no cramps either, which was nice.
17	157	Before the pill I had unbearable cramps and my periods were very heavy, however within the first month on the pill my period became light, lasting 4-5 days, and my cramps became barely noticeable.
17	158	It does help me with my cramps a lot.
17	159	I went on it for severe cramps and heavy bleeding.
17	160	I have been on Loestrin 24 for a year and a half now due to heavy periods and severe cramps and I haven't had many problems with it.
17	161	My periods have gotten lighter only lasting about 4 days and I have had little to no cramps.
17	162	Setting alarms every 2 hours at night was not fun) and severe cramps that caused me to black out and miss school.
17	163	Love the fact that it's taking care of the terrible menstrual cramps and bloating I used to have.
17	164	Only a few things have remained annoying about this medicine like irritability, cramps, and tiredness while menstruating, but isn't that what happens anyway?
17	165	I'm talking to my doctor and either switching back to Kariva (I'd rather have cramps than this) or using another method.
17	166	I started to have horrible cramps and I get super bloated about a week before I start.
17	167	I started taking this pill five months ago for terrible cramps.
17	168	The period was regular and the cramps were nearly non-existent.
17	169	It hasn't so much helped my period length yet, but it did take away the feeling of cramps which was nice.
17	170	The first 3 months I would get a bit of nausea and cramps, but the doctor said to keep taking for three months because it is supposed to resemble pregnancy!
17	171	This month have been having really bad stomach aches and cramps.
17	172	My cycle had been regular for years, but I experienced ultra heavy bleeding for 5-8 days and cramps that were so bad that I nearly destroyed my liver from the ibuprofen I would consume.
17	173	I would be nauseous for at least two days, have cramps so badly I had to stay home some days and my PMS and mood swings were terrible.
17	174	I have been on Loestrin 24 for 10 months now and my periods haven't been longer than 3 days, the third month my period was really heavy and I had bad cramps.
17	175	No cramps though, no noticeable mood swings.
17	176	Before the pill I experienced heavy bleeding, paralyzing cramps and occasionally vomiting.
17	177	I usuallly get terrible cramps, pains, nausea, etc.
17	178	This was my first time NOT throwing up during my period, and I stopped getting those terrible cramps.
17	179	I have extreme cramps and find myself experiencing tons of mood swings.
17	180	I just got my period today, and it's very very light and hardly any cramps.
17	181	I had terrible cramps on this pill.
17	182	Every 3 days I had cramps and my breasts were tender.
17	183	My periods were always cramp free and regular without birth control.
17	184	My periods are more like two days of light cramping and then brown sludge for 3 to 4 days.
17	185	Although my skin was clear and it was effective at basically eliminating my period and most cramping, DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL.
17	186	I experienced a lighter period the second month and my cramping was less severe.
17	187	I have no cramping at all, no more mood swings.
17	188	My period lasts only like 3 days on the sugar pills, experience barely any cramping.
17	189	I switch to an intrauterine device and had 1-2 days but I don't want to deal with the cramping again so I am going to try something else.
17	190	However, the bright side is that my periods are non-existent and I don't have cramping.
17	191	From having my period for a week with severe cramping and heavy periods, I went to three days with very little bleeding and not much cramping.
17	192	It lightened my periods to about 2-3 days with hardly any painful cramping.
17	193	I don't regularly experience cramping with my periods either.
17	194	This birth control has the lowest dose of hormones which controls nausea (a huge problem with previous birth controls), my skin looks great, no weight gain, cramping or bloating, PMS and hormones are regulated and my period disappeared after about 6 months.
17	195	At first, I experienced a little bloating and cramping, my periods were really heavy and lasted for 7 days for the 1st three months, but now they last 3 days and that's it.
17	196	I never had any symptoms with this birth control and it really controls my extreme cramping!
17	197	Now I barely even notice cramping.
17	198	I switched pills because all of a sudden I started bleeding and cramping all the time and not following the pill schedule.
17	199	This pill reduced my pre-period mood swings, cravings for everything in sight, and cramping.
17	200	I could do without the cramping and bloating but that's the life of a woman I guess.
17	201	I was on Lo Loestrin for 2 months and it was not working out (breakthrough bleeding, cramping, bloating), so my doctor switched me to this pill.
17	202	Periods were light, about 2 -3 days, without cramping.
17	203	My periods were always light and the first period I had while using Loestrin 24 Fe was 3 days of pantyliner, light bleeding and very very mild cramping, which was reassuring but not annoying.
17	204	But, after those couple of months the cramping went away, and my periods are light, only lasting about 2-3 days.
17	205	I also used to have severe cramping and now I have none.
17	206	I have had problems with ovarian cysts since I was 14 so my doctor put me on birth control to help with the pain and cramping every month.
17	207	I know it's only been a month but I have experienced mild headaches, breast tenderness but they have grown and I love it (I was not blessed with breasts) and mild cramping.
17	208	I was prescribed Loestrin 24 for both birth control and because of heavy cramping.
17	209	My periods were light, the cramping stopped, and I didn't get pregnant during the 5 months that I was on it.
17	210	I was on Loestrin 24 (1/20) for two years because I became sexually active and it would also help with my cramping.
17	211	I switched from Kariva because I was having pretty bad cramping during my period.
17	212	My periods used to be moderately heavy with a lot of cramping and would last at least 7 days.
17	213	I had no sex drive, some cramping in between periods and I felt very depressed and insecure.
17	214	I'm 42 years old and prior to taking Loestrin 24, I had one day of bad cramping with my period which lasted 5 days.
17	215	I started this pill after my period and for 15 days I bled and it was the worst cramping in my life.
17	216	Since I have been on the pill I have had shorter, lighter periods and very minimal cramping (if at all).
17	217	The cramping has subsided greatly.
17	218	The second month my sex drive went back to normal but my period lasted only 2 days again with lots of cramping but only spotting.
17	219	I was prepared for side effects and the first week of use I had some headaches, slight nausea and pretty strong cramping.
17	220	It did make my heavy crampy periods light and short and my breasts noticeably bigger.
17	221	My first period on the pill was crampy, although I did start my first pill pack after I had ovulated.
17	222	I had spotting every day since day 5 of the pack.
17	223	Combined with the constant spotting and losing all my good thongs to the BC being sassy , I decided to switch back.
17	224	Pack 3, I spotted for 2 weeks and then had heavier spotting for a period.
17	225	The first two weeks I did have heavy spotting and slight nausea, which went away before the first month was over.
17	226	I had bleeding every day of the month, not spotting, BLEEDING.
17	227	No spotting, mood swings, headaches, depression and my skin is more clear than before.
17	228	I specifically asked my doctor for a low-dose pill because I have had really bad experiences with birth control in the past, from weight gain to ridiculous mood swings, PMS, to my sex drive gone, to constant spotting.
17	229	The first month I had spotting and now I get my period every month, its very light, and lasts 2-3 days.
17	230	I finally switched because I experienced two days of constant bleeding ("spotting") two weeks into my cycle for five months in a row.
17	231	However, I've unfortunately suffered the side effects, the first month I was spotting for about 2 weeks until my period which thankfully was now only 2 days long vs my previous heavy 5-7 days I normally had.
17	232	I have not had any spotting, any bleeding, nothing at all!
17	233	The only issue was that I had some mild spotting about a week before my placebo pills for the first two packs.
17	234	My periods are extremely light ranging from nothing to mild and heavier spotting.
17	235	I had no spotting, no missed periods, and no weight gain.
17	236	It's not even really spotting, there's basically nothing.
17	237	No side effects, no spotting.
17	238	So far I've experienced massive bloating, nausea, very tender breasts, headaches, and mild spotting.
17	239	I did have some spotting but it was because I wasn't taking the pill at the same time everyday.
17	240	Not really any bad side effects besides first month spotting but thats gone.
17	241	I had spotting and bleeding for about 3 weeks and now, barely anything.
17	242	I've had spotting and my breasts hurt sometimes but that's the only negative thing.
17	243	So I have taken a pack and a half of Loestrin 24 and all was good until 2 weeks in and I started spotting and got my period.
17	244	I have now been spotting for a whole month on and off.
17	245	Other than the random spotting for a month I have nothing bad to say about this pill.
17	246	I've experienced weight gain, crazy spotting that is disruptive to everyday life, extreme anger, frustration, depression, etc.
17	247	This time around though I am a little worried as I experienced spotting the whole week before my period and now nothing during it.
17	248	Overall I'll stick with this pill and hope the spotting goes away in the next few months because that's my only real complaint.
17	249	Then 2 days later it came back on and I have been spotting ever since then.
17	250	Other than that and some spotting when I missed a pill one time, this works.
17	251	1st month I kept forgetting the pill so I would double up - not good I know but there were no bad side effects other than spotting before and after my period.
17	252	I also had some spotting for the first couple of months, but now everything is fine!
17	253	When I started taking the birth control I did have some crappy side effects such as bloating, weight gain, and a lot of spotting to a flow like a regular period but it went away after 2 months of using it.
17	254	Also, I do have spotting though I'm not sure if its because I'm not always exactly on time when taking the pill (an hour or 2 off).
17	255	Overall I like it but annoyed with the spotting.
17	256	I've had the heavy spotting almost like a regular period 2 weeks before my actual period suppose to start.
17	257	My only concern was not getting a period, only spotting but after reading the many reviews this must be pretty common.
17	258	The only symptoms I have experienced was some spotting.
17	259	After only a month of that, I have noticed extreme anxiety and mood swings, random spotting, loss of libido, and nausea.
17	260	I took this pill for the first time this month and I had periods (not spotting) every alternate week.
17	261	I am coming off of it because it causes me to have very bad headaches and spotting a lot.
17	262	I would have spotting off and on and then I was having a period the week before my brown pills.
17	263	The first two months I had a bit of spotting but I didn't get my period... so of course I had a mini panic attack.
17	264	Also the spotting has pretty much almost gone away and I still haven't had my period.
17	265	I've also had some random spotting.
17	266	), but I also experienced increasingly light/missed periods, frequent spotting in between, and most recently, recurring ovarian cysts which grow so large that they rupture and cause the most excruciating pain I've ever felt.
17	267	In the three cycles that I've been on it, I have gotten my period 6 times with irregular spotting in between, so it is not at all having the effects I was hoping for.
17	268	I also haven't had any bleeding or spotting between periods.
17	269	It has helped prevent pregnancy, but gave me some spotting close to my periods if I maybe did not take it right on time.
17	270	I don't even have spotting between periods.
17	271	I have been spotting now for about 3 days.
17	272	I've never been on birth control so this is all new to me, but the first few weeks I had really heavy spotting, and then I didn't get my period at all when I was supposed to.
17	273	This birth control made me have my period every other week, and when I wasn't on it there was still spotting, which made me crazy emotional.
17	274	Also, I haven't had a period in 6 months, not even spotting.
17	275	Then the next month it was regulated and now AGAIN, 2 weeks into the pill I am spotting AGAIN.
17	276	There was about a day of spotting and then that was it so of course I panicked that I was pregnant.
17	277	The only downside for my body was that this pill makes you spot on and off so I keep having to wear a panty liner and it makes me really emotional like I cry over everything and I was never that sensitive.
17	278	Also, I spot bled throughout the entire month.
17	279	I have had a large amount of spot bleeding, it has decreased as the months have gone on.
17	280	My only complaint is that it made me spot bleed throughout the first month, which was annoying, and I have become a little more emotional but it's nothing serious - and that happens with most birth control pills, anyways.
17	281	My doctor says the spot bleeding is just something you need to tough out, and if you can, it gets much better after the first few months.
17	282	I may spot for a day every couple of months on this pill, so my boyfriend definitely likes this.
17	283	My periods are only for the 4 days that I am off the pill, and I spot irregularly in between periods, but not very often.
17	284	I just spot 2-3 days at the end of my cycle.
17	285	I'm sick and nauseated all of the time and since I spot every now and then..I couldn't tell if I missed a period or not!
17	286	Pack 2, in the second week I spotted a lot, then got a 2 day period on schedule.
17	287	I spotted for a few weeks at first, but it never happened again.
17	288	I spotted for the first 2.5 weeks and am on week 2 of my second pack and never started my period during the placebo days.
17	289	I spotted on the second week but other than that I'm fine.
17	290	The first month I was really nauseous a lot and I spotted blood every single day for a month.
17	291	In the beginning I spotted here and there and my period lasted longer than 4 days.
17	292	I also spotted like a moron for a couple of months till my body got used to it.
17	293	I spotted for the first month, but I could deal with that, too.
17	294	I spotted twice and had a very light period for 3 days.
17	295	I had to lay in the dark for several hours to get the headache to go away then had neck and back pain for a week afterwards.
17	296	But this pill made me sick when I missed a day and took two so I took some Tylenol for my horrible headache (I believe that was also from Loestrin24).
17	297	I've only been on Loestrin for 2 days.The first day I had a terrible headache and had to call out of work due to stomach pain and lethargy [although I often feel stomach pain when I have a heavy period].
17	298	I went on this to help with my chronic headaches and menstrual migraines, but it didn't help either.
17	299	I'm getting headaches every day still and I break out constantly.
17	300	I started taking Loestrin in Sep 2015 after experiencing weight gain, general sadness and headaches on Yasmin.
17	301	No mood swings, appetite normal, no headaches or bad side effects.
17	302	I love these pills but the only downfall is even though I don't come on I still have the mood swings, irritating moments, feeling strange, headaches etc.
17	303	Serious mood swings, headaches, breast tenderness, acne- it also made me starving- like Permanent PMS.
17	304	I had intense headaches, nausea, and occasional mood swings.
17	305	I'm not as moody, cycle only lasts for 4 days instead of 7 days, breast size was C 34 now D 40, haven't lost weight, still have headaches, nausea.
17	306	I did have stomach discomfort, headaches and a few other symptoms that subsided within the first few weeks.
17	307	I had some small headaches week 1, but other than that I've loved this medication!
17	308	I'm only on my 2nd week so some side effects right now are slight nausea, headaches and some light bleeding.
17	309	I no longer get headaches before or during my period, which has happened with every other birth control.
17	310	I only had slight headaches.
17	311	I did not have any issues with nausea or headaches.
17	312	However I had to stop taking the pill because it gave me horrible tension headaches.
17	313	I will admit the first month was kind of rough with the mood swings and headaches but once my body got adjusted it was perfectly fine.
17	314	So I'm a little worried and I get headaches a lot and my breasts hurt (this just started a week ago).
17	315	So far I haven't had any mood swings, headaches, nausea, etc.
17	316	I did not have any nausea or headaches whatsoever.
17	317	No weight gain, no headaches, no other problems.
17	318	The headaches from this medicine is unbearable at times.
17	319	Definitely increased my sex drive, no headaches or even pain around my period.
17	320	I get headaches, sweat profusely, and have trouble focusing.
17	321	Since I've been on it I have lost my sex drive, can't sleep, slurred speech, headaches, you name it.
17	322	I gained a lot of weight and had terrible headaches about 3 to 4 times a week.
17	323	In addition, just mild headaches.
17	324	Besides the weight I added in those 15 days that I had lost in the prior month, I was bloated, couldn't sleep through the night, and had terrible headaches.
17	325	Only side effects I've experienced are the VERY RARE bad headaches.
17	326	This took about 3 months to acclimate to.... Had the mood swings and nausea and headaches in the first couple of months.
17	327	Started having horrible headaches, insomnia, some night sweats, nervousness, gas/nausea/diarrhea.
17	328	After about 5 years of being on this brand I started getting really bad symptoms (nausea, cold sweats, dropped body temp, migraine) so I decided to quit birth control all together (was on it about 10 years).
17	329	As directed, I went straight to the ER and they concluded it must have been an eye migraine.
17	330	You have to take the pill on Sunday, 4 days after starting the pill, I woke up 4 consecutive nights with piercing pains in my stomach, and a severe migraine.
17	331	It is a smaller dose of hormones from what I was taking- which helped reduce my migraine count to once a week versus everday.
17	332	My migraines were so bad they thought I had a tumor.
17	333	The first time went well but I was taken off of it due migraines again with auras.
17	334	I have tried many pills and this one was better than the rest but I am switching because I get terrible migraines.
17	335	On this pill I was getting 16-20 days of migraines even though this has the lowest, constant dose of estrogen.
17	336	Multi-phasic pills gave me 20-25 days of migraines.
17	337	Good Birth Control but bad for migraines.
17	338	I was given this for migraines.
17	339	However now that I have had a child (1 year) I have been taking this medicine and I have noticed that I am bloating having severe stomach problems that last hours, migraines, dizziness, and massive mood swings.
17	340	The first 3-4 days I had severe migraines constantly.
17	341	My skin is more clear, my attitude is happier, my sex drive is through the roof, and I think depending on your natural level of hormones, this pill can do great things for you.
17	342	It made me very irritated out of nowhere sometimes, would make me very emotional around my MS and made me have absolutely NO sex drive.
17	343	This absolutely murdered my sex drive and my ability to have an orgasm.
17	344	I did notice a significant increase in vaginal fluids throughout the day, and it actually increased my sex drive (not a problem in my opinion).
17	345	But I didn't like being on the pill, I gained weight, had mood swings, and lost my sex drive.
17	346	Only negative- did decrease sex drive a LOT.
17	347	A couple months in, I noticed a huge decline in sex drive.
17	348	I didn't know the moodiness and low sex drive could have to do with the birth control I am on, and after doing research I realized what it is.
17	349	My period is much lighter and my sex drive is still there.
17	350	The worst is I have LOST MY SEX DRIVE.
17	351	The irritability and decreased sex drive could just be stress related.
17	352	It worked well and did it's job, but sometimes made me depressed and have no sex drive whatsoever.
17	353	My sex drive has increased significantly and I have been climaxing very quickly.
17	354	My sex drive has not changed and is still in healthy and working order.
17	355	The other side effect, I'm moody and no sex drive.
17	356	Another this is I have absolutely no sex drive.
17	357	I had to get off this medication though because it killed my sex drive which is not good because I'm a newlywed.
17	358	Decreased my sex drive slightly and I get random period/spotting or nothing at all.
17	359	Also my sex drive has stayed the same.
17	360	Sex drive went down, weight didn't change, no breast enlargement, harder to get and stay wet.
17	361	I personally was going to have my doctor change this medication due to my having NO sex drive at all.
17	362	I have always had a super high sex drive and I went to not wanting to have sex at all.
17	363	I did notice my sex drive decreased greatly, and it did increase the severity of my bipolar disorder.
17	364	I also didn't experience any change in my sex drive.
17	365	My sex drive is amazing, haven't gained any weight, no mood swings, nothing.
17	366	My boyfriend loves the increased sex drive!
17	367	I have noticed clearer skin, increased sex drive, and the start of increased cup size, my boobs feel heavier and fuller!
17	368	M y boyfriend has noticed my increased sex drive but he's okay with it.
17	369	I believe it's fairly effective at preventing pregnancy, but considering I have next to no sex drive (as my husband can attest) it may be hard to tell.
17	370	Didn't worsen or better my skin and did not cause me ANY mood swings and my sex drive is still intact, haha.
17	371	I have ZERO sex drive.
17	372	The first month my sex drive went up 200%.
17	373	I get CRAZY mood swings, I've gained weight and I've lost my sex drive.
17	374	I have lost my sex drive and my boobs will hurt.
17	375	However, as time went on, I noticed that I would get stomach aches and the main issue was loss of sex drive.
17	376	Also I would experience randomly on this pill the loss of my sex drive.
17	377	However, I had side effects:  much lower libido, difficulty having an orgasm, and digestive problems every evening.
17	378	No side effects whatsoever, my breasts are a bit larger, which is very good news after the consequences of breastfeeding 2 babies, libido is fine and well, no weight gain at all.
17	379	Despite all that, my libido decreased exponentially, I had two small periods during the month and experienced radical mood swings (feelings of anger, depression and anxiety).
17	380	I've only been taking this pill for a month, and in comparison to other users, I haven't had any weight gain or loss.
17	381	I was taking Microgestin for 4 years and switched to test out if the other BC was giving me weight gain.
17	382	I've tried other birth control pills before and had to go off of them because of weight gain.
17	383	When I finally got back on the pills, I thought it was great because my periods were always regular, I had no weight gain, and my skin was flawless.
17	384	The main reason I'm on birth control is to lighten my very heavy periods, which it does, but the side effect of increased appetite which causes weight gain makes it not worth it.
17	385	As for weight gain, I feel bloated, but I always have problems with bloating - so I would need more time before I blame the birth control.
17	386	I have no real side effects the only one I can think of is weight gain.
17	387	I would recommend Loestrin, except for the weight gain.
17	388	No horrific weight gain.
17	389	No weight gain, lighter period, no mood swings/depression and no pregnancies.
17	390	I did experience slight weight gain but nothing serious.
17	391	I noticed no weight gain or breakouts...it actually cleared up my skin.
17	392	No weight gain which was great because as soon as I left Loestrin I gained 15 lbs on my new pill.
17	393	Over the past few years, I have had consistent weight gain, without changing my diet or exercise routine.
17	394	Only things that are deeply disturbing is the weight gain that I gained in such a small period of time also my breasts have become increasingly sore at all times of the day.
17	395	I didn't experience any real weight gain or loss but I think I might have gone up half a cup or a whole cup size.
17	396	I have had no weight gain, my breasts are tender, but they have gotten fuller and bigger.
17	397	I'm off to a good start with this pill, it has actually already started to clear up my skin a little and so far I've experienced no other changes like mood swings, bloating, weight gain etc.
17	398	I have been taking Loestrin 24 FE since July of 2011 and I must say I haven't noticed any weight gain or anything.
17	399	Towards the end I started noticing weight gain, crazy moods, etc.
17	400	I also don't want weight gain.
17	401	No side effects or weight gain either.
17	402	No weight gain and I finally feel like myself after trying several pills.
17	403	I love the weight in my breasts but I have gained 5 pounds, and I eat the same if not better than before I got on the pill and I exercise just as much so I'm considering stopping the pill and switching to another method of birth control because weight gain and me do not mix well!
17	404	Other than the weight gain this pill has been my best fiend, so if it doesn't seem to make you gain weight I would say it is the best!
17	405	I haven't noticed any other weight gain at all.
17	406	When I first started I had weight gain and SUCH insane mood swings for months that it completely ruined my relationship and my life.
17	407	I haven't felt any moodiness, weight gain, or anything negative.
17	408	Before I was on Fencom Fe which gave me an intense appetite, weight gain and painful periods.
17	409	I did not experience weight gain or any abnormal side effects.
17	410	This birth control worked great for me, no weight gain, nausea or anything.
17	411	No weight gain for me at all whatsoever.
17	412	In terms of weight gain, which was my biggest concern, I haven't had any noticeable gain.
17	413	At first, I was scared because of all the stories you hear about mood swings and weight gain, but I have not experienced either.
17	414	Nowhere near the weight gain I had while previously on Depo (maybe a pound or 2 on Loestrin) and my breasts have become significantly bigger (to the happiness of my boyfriend) and my skin is SO much smoother (also huge perk for him).
17	415	It caused weight gain, and I developed several cysts on my breasts after 2 months of taking it.
17	416	There has been no weight gain, and it has only slightly changed the size of my breasts.
17	417	No weight gain, no mood swings, no nothing which I think is amazing.
17	418	I have had zero weight gain and no complaints other than the price.
17	419	So I recommend LOESTRIN 24 Fe (little weight gain).
17	420	I don't have mood swings, which I have got with other birth control, my face is a little dry now which is fine because I had super oily skin and I have not noticed any weight gain.
17	421	I had no side effects and no weight gain when taking it, other than not having a period.
17	422	I haven't had any noticeable weight gain.
17	423	One thing I would have to say though that I hate about this pill is the weight gain.
17	424	Aside from the rapid weight gain this pill is okay.
17	425	The breats I suppose I don't mind too much but I absolutley cannot stand the weight gain.
17	426	I have not gotten any weight gain as with other methods of birth control.
17	427	I did not have any weight gain but the pill caused me to have MAJOR mood swings towards my 4th-6th month.
17	428	However, I'm ECSTATIC that I have not experienced any bloating or weight gain the first few days of taking the pill.
17	429	When on Yaz and Yasmin I experienced that immediately almost with an addition of 8 lbs weight gain.
17	430	I haven't had any side effects, no weight gain but I haven't gotten my period this month and I'm not pregnant.
17	431	I had weight gain, not a lot, but about 5 -7 lbs, enough to notice, then after taking it for 3 months I stopped having periods all together, My doctor told me to go off it and after 2 months, my period was back.
17	432	I don't mind weight gain (or increase in breast size) however this pill didn't seem to alter with either one in any way.
17	433	Haven't had any weight gain, bloating or anything.
17	434	So far, I have experienced extreme mood swings over the past few days, slight weight gain, and breast tenderness.
17	435	Within 2 months I gained 10 pounds, particularly in the midsection.
17	436	My weight steadily kept going up until I gained about 30 lbs in 6 months, again mostly in my belly.
17	437	And I gained no weight at all and no bloating.
17	438	Also my boobs have grown a cup size which is good, but I have also gained weight and can't seem to shift it.
17	439	it's Thursday and I started it Sunday and I've gained probably 5-6 pounds already.
17	440	When I started taking it I dropped 15-20 pounds within roughly 2 months and gained it all back almost instantly.
17	441	I gained about 6 lbs but not even in the beginning it was about 3 months in.
17	442	I have not gained any weight.
17	443	Cons were that I gained fat only in my stomach and my bum, which was weird.
17	444	I haven't gained that much weight but I will say it makes me have an appetite like a man!
17	445	I initially gained about 10 pounds and have consistently continued to gain weight.
17	446	Then at my most recent doctor appointment, I was shocked to realized I had gained around 20 lbs.
17	447	I had become well aware of my constant bloated stomach but I had no idea I had gained so much.
17	448	I have not gained weight, although I find it more difficult to lose weight.
17	449	I don't have any mood swings and haven't gained any weight, in fact I've lost weight!
17	450	I gained maybe 5lbs but that's probably from not working out and eating way more.
17	451	It made my breasts a lot bigger, I went from a 32A to 32C and I haven't gained any weight in the past three years.
17	452	I gained 20 pounds and experienced difficulty with motivation.
17	453	Since I have switched I have much lighter, if any, periods, and haven't gained any weight but my breasts have gotten bigger (went from a 34C to a 34D).
17	454	I gained no weight, had no mood swings, or any other side effects birth control normally gives.
17	455	I never gained weight, in fact, I actually gained 5lbs after stopping the pill.
17	456	I haven't gained weight but I can't lose it either no matter how hard I try.
17	457	I have noticed some bloating just before/during my period but I haven't gained any weight since being on this pill.
17	458	The mood swings came, and I gained some weight, even though my diet has always been very healthy.
17	459	I haven't gained any weight, that I know of.
17	460	I can't blame my doctor for prescribing this about 7 months ago when I told her I was a raging maniac who was blowing up faster than a ballon at a carnival on Seasonique....but as a result I have gained a disgusting amount of weight.
17	461	I haven't gained a single pound on Loestrin; if anything I've lost weight while I've been on it without trying!
17	462	I gained about 8-10 pounds and can't seem to get it off.
17	463	I started it near summer going into college and I may have gained 1 pound from eating junk food in the summer.
17	464	I also think I have gained weight.
17	465	And I've gained 1/2 a cup size.
17	466	I gained 30lbs with Sprintec in a span of 6 months, but I took 20lbs of it off in a whole semester.
17	467	On Loestrin, I'm trying to lose the other 10, and I cannot lose weight (and plus I've gained 5 back).
17	468	I haven't gained tremendous weight, though my breasts have gotten HUGE.
17	469	I have also gained weight since on this birth control with no changes to diet or exercise.
17	470	Also I gained about 10lbs on it.
17	471	I had no problems with it and loved it except that I gained around 15 pounds (although this could have been caused by the infamous freshmen 15).
17	472	7 months into the pill I noticed I gained weight (mainly all in the belly area, I gained 14lbs).
17	473	I know it takes a while to get into my system, but I've already gained 10 pounds.
17	474	However I gained 10 pounds because the pill has made me have a larger appetite and makes me crave food all the time.
17	475	I haven't gained any weight, as a matter of fact I lost weight while on this pill.
17	476	In the first six months of this pill I gained 25 pounds!
17	477	After that I have not gained any weight, though it has been very hard trying to lose the 25 pounds.
17	478	Just be warned- I gained approximately 13lbs.
17	479	I was on the Depo shot for about a year and it was nice, until I gained 15 pounds.
17	480	I gained a little weight.
17	481	I never gained any weight and my breasts were never tender.
17	482	I have gained about 8lbs and I do have some up and down mood swings.
17	483	Now that my body is starting to get used to it, I am losing some of the weight I gained with the initial use of Loestrin.
17	484	I have lost hair and gained some weight.
17	485	I have been bleeding this whole month and have gained about 7lbs.
17	486	However, I haven't gained any weight and my periods are super light and last only about 2-3 days.
17	487	Also, I had maintained the same weight for years, and after being on Loestrin for 5 or 6 months I somehow gained over 10lbs with no change in my eating habits.
17	488	The only thing is - I think I gained weight, 15lbs in these 2 years...but not sure if that is the pill or me eating more candy and junk food.
17	489	The only negative side effects that have occurred since taking the pill: I gained 10 pounds the first two weeks of taking this pill.
17	490	I gained no weight but it certainly reshaped my body.
17	491	The bad: Since I've been on it I've gained about 20 pounds.
17	492	I have gained weight, am extremely tired all the time and cannot ever seem to get enough rest.
17	493	I never gained weight on Yaz and I've gained a few pounds with this pill.
17	494	I find myself sleeping alot, feeling depressed, I have for sure gained weight, and the worst of it all would be MOOD SWINGS.
17	495	I've been running 4-8 miles a day and still gained weight.
17	496	No nausea, no mood swings.
17	497	Everyone reacts differently but if you're going to try this pill, just know if you're like me there's a possibility of a lot of debilitating nausea and chances of fever.
17	498	Extreme nausea.
17	499	Before I even take the pill, I'm good no mood swings I don't feel nausea nothing at all.
17	500	After I take the pill, like 5 hours later I start feeling nausea, moody, I just want to go to bed and sleep.
17	501	During my third pack of pills, I had pregnancy symptoms during the second week of use that scared me: vivid dreams, bad nausea without vomiting, sensitivity to smells, heavy appetite, moodiness, and most distinct was the pain of breast tenderness.
17	502	I've been on the pill for 3 months now, I have experienced extreme nausea, bloating, mood swings, and even crazy cravings!
17	503	The first 3 or 4 days I had some bad nausea and I did notice a little bloating, but both faded quickly.
17	504	I've also had some occasional nausea, but nothing too bad, and it passes quickly.
17	505	The first 2 weeks I had some nausea and I am still getting bloating and sore breasts but other than that it has been good.
17	506	I have had no mood swings or nausea.
17	507	The first couple of weeks or so I had some significant nausea and bloating.
17	508	I take it at night because I wanted to try to avoid nausea.
17	509	My breast are tender and I feel nausea all the time.
17	510	I take mine before I go to bed and they said take it with food it should help with the nausea.
17	511	I do experience nausea, but I get that with every pill I have tried so far.
17	512	I didn't have any problems with nausea outside the first week, which maybe could be attributed to other factors.
17	513	In the middle of my second cycle I experienced severe nausea, anxiety, bloating, and breast enlargement.
17	514	Going on my 4th month now, and the nausea is absolutely ridiculous.
17	515	I have experienced a little nausea.
17	516	The first three days weren't too bad except for some light nausea.
17	517	The fourth night was absolutely terrible- it made me feel like I had the flu the nausea was so bad.
17	518	After that night, I've only experienced occasional light to moderate nausea.
17	519	I do not get crazy mood swings, nausea and I did not gain weight.
17	520	However, I have noticed that when I do have my cycle (which is rare) I become extremely nauseated and feel absolutely sick.
17	521	Also, if the pill was missed or taken late, then it made me very nauseated and I had to miss class a few times.
17	522	Once I started taking it, I was very nauseous daily for a week.
17	523	I only feel nauseous if I miss a pill and have to double up or take 2 a day.
17	524	It made me nauseous when I first started taking it, but that went away pretty quickly.
17	525	I have been very nauseous.
17	526	I also get extremely nauseous now.
17	527	I didn't gain any weight, don't remember if it ever made me nauseous but I had to stop taking it because my hair began to fall out.
17	528	I still feel a bit nauseous when I wake up for the few days after I restart the placebo.
17	529	The first few days I was kind of shaky and dizzy, but the past 3 days, I've felt nauseous and very tired.
17	530	As far as side-effects, honestly, I can be very irritable and/or emotional at times and occasionally a little nauseous, but that only lasts for a couple of minutes.
17	531	Last night I woke up at 2am in severe pain- I felt extremely nauseous, felt as if I needed to vomit and cry but I could not cry.
17	532	I was extremely nauseous and fatigued and didn't feel like myself.
17	533	It made me nauseous, my boobs hurt, and all that, but after a while that disappeared.
17	534	I take the pill in the morning and it does make me nauseous.
17	535	I constantly felt nauseous and developed urinary tract infections and yeast infections, strange discharges and odors.
17	536	I'm into my second pack and am not pregnant (which is good) but I'm very nauseous, queasy, dizzy and lightheaded.
17	537	I felt dizzy all the time and like I would pass out, I just felt miserable.
17	538	The worst of it is when I ovulate and then I go through cycles of being really tired and feeling dizzy.
17	539	I got a little moody at times, my period is lighter and shorter about a couple of days ago I started getting dizzy when I moved too fast and my breast got a little bigger.
17	540	I get dizzy and very moody.
17	541	The only side effects I've had are a heightened sense of smell (can't deal with most smells anymore) and a recurring dizzy feeling.
17	542	I've never had any problems with the length or intensity of my period but on this pill I felt sick all the time, dizzy, anxious, moody and tired.
17	543	I only took it for about a month then stopped due to side effects such has dizziness and chest pain.
17	544	I'm going to keep using this  for months but if the dizziness don't go away I'm going to stop it.
17	545	I would also have very brief moments of dizziness.
17	546	For example, if I turned my head too fast I'd feel a flash of dizziness.
17	547	I do experience slight irregular mood swings as well, but nothing horrible.
17	548	Also, my mood swings are a rollercoaster and I can feel sad and cry for no reason in the middle of the day and feel happy again right after that.
17	549	Cannot wait to get off this pill...horrible mood swings!
17	550	It gave me horrible mood swings, anxiety and made me irrational, unreasonable and angry (basically insane) - which I didn't realize until I stopped taking it.
17	551	I would have the worst mood swings of my life.
17	552	No mood swings.
17	553	Also it did not help with my crazy PMS mood swings.
17	554	In the beginning I had A LOT of mood swings and would cry a lot, but that's normal for the first couple of months while your body is getting used to the hormones.
17	555	I did not have mood swings until I switched to Loestrin 10.
17	556	I have mood swings every now and again and in the beginning I would get depressed very quickly but that didn't last long.
17	557	I have been using Loestrin for about a year now and at first I had horrible mood swings, I was hungry all the time, and my breasts hurt.
17	558	I did have severe mood swings and my breast size did increase just a little.
17	559	And the mood swings were ridiculous!
17	560	No anxiety, no crazy mood swings.
17	561	My mood swings are horrible and I feel like a crazy depressed person on this pill.
17	562	On Yaz, my PMS was barely noticeable, let alone mood swings.
17	563	I had horrible mood swings and pretty much had no control over my anger.
17	564	The third month I began having violent mood swings and emotional breakdowns that were not triggered from outside issues.
17	565	I lost my insurance, so along with financial issues as well as the mood swings, I stopped taking it.
17	566	Overall, I love it and it didn't give me horrible mood swings like other pills.
17	567	Since taking Loestrin (I'm into my fourth pack = four months), my mood swings have continued to get worse.
17	568	As far as mood swings it comes and goes.
17	569	I also had pretty bad mood swings, but nothing I couldn't sort out.
17	570	Aside from maybe being a tiny bit more prone to crying, I've not had mood swings, anxiety, depression, or unreasonable anger.
17	571	I do only have my period every 2 to 3 months for a week, but it definitely beats having it every 3 to 4 months very heavily for almost the entire month.The only things I'm not all that happy about are the mood swings never went away, I do still have them, but I can control it and aren't nearly as crazy as they used to be.
17	572	I also have no other complaints other than the mood swings I had been throwing at my boyfriend and my family.
17	573	I did have some bloating and mood swings in the first couple of weeks, but my doctor said it was normal because my body was adjusting to the drug.
17	574	I started taking Loestrin 24 Fe after taking Tri-sprintec for 4 months and experiencing depression and mood swings.
17	575	Other minor side effects were some mood swings the first month, and I did gain weight in my breasts during the 3 months I was on Loestrin.
17	576	More things that I've noticed that I haven't liked are mood swings at least a week before my period, tender breasts, and irregular periods.
17	577	Major mood swings and depression during 3rd week of the month.
17	578	Doctor switched me to Loseasonique because of the mood swings.
17	579	I was put on Yaz to control my mood swings during my period but it ended up making me experience periods that would last 2 weeks with very heavy bleeding the whole time.
17	580	I now have very regular, light periods with Loestrin and it still controls my mood swings.
17	581	No mood swings or side effects, but I just switched because my breakthrough bleeding got bad.
17	582	I have CRAZY mood swings.
17	583	Loestrin calmed down my extreme mood swings from the patch (I was on the patch for a year).
17	584	Mood swings here and there as well.
17	585	Some mood swings and definitely feels like I am PMSing all over again.
17	586	I have not had mood swings (in fact, I feel I am a less moodier person now).
17	587	I also am very depressed on it, and experience crazy mood swings.
17	588	The boyfriend isn't complaining but also the first month I was a raging lunatic with mood swings from hell.
17	589	The worst by far, however, were the EXTREME mood swings I experienced on this pill.
17	590	I am constantly depressed and have severe and uncontrollable mood swings.
17	591	I am having the worst mood swings ever and worst of all it is making me gain weight like crazy!
17	592	The second week brought on crazy mood swings and that is actually what made me stop.
17	593	I've been on this medication to regulate my period and the mood swings are really bad.
17	594	I just couldn't deal with the mood changes.
17	595	No mood changes, no weight changes, regulated my period for months, and now I've been on it for a year?
17	596	I must admit I was a nervous wreck without my period the first month, bothered my Doctor about a pregnancy test and it was NEGATIVE.
17	597	I was very nervous, I have been taking it for almost 2 months and let me tell you, I LOVE IT.
17	598	I felt extremely nervous and sick.
17	599	I was really nervous about taking birth control but it's been a really good experience!
17	600	I was a little nervous about it, but my doctor assured me that not having a period was normal (especially if you were light before) and that it would not effect my ability to have children later.
17	601	Also, I'm experiencing anxiety and nervousness.
17	602	In the second month I developed this weird anxiety and had this constant sense of nervousness.
17	603	Made me super anxious
17	604	It made me anxious and I had trouble sleeping.
17	605	I felt like I was on the verge of crying all the time, really depressed, really anxious and really tired.
17	606	And lastly, I am always anxious.
17	607	I'm so anxious, I can hardly be around my friends, colleagues and family.
17	608	When looking for a birth control I have trouble finding one that doesn't make me anxious and hormonal.
17	609	I have found myself needing to control situations and getting anxious and sad for no reason.
17	610	I am anxious and my moods are unpredictable.
17	611	I was a bit scared to start it because of some revies I was reading, about it making people crazy, emotional and anxious but decided that everyone responds differently to different pills and I gave it a shot.
17	612	My anxiety was through the roof, I had so many panic attacks, I didn't feel like I was myself the 9 months I was on it.
17	613	At the time I was starting a new job & training for a marathon so initially put my anxiety down to that.
17	614	However after completing the race & becoming settled & happy in my new job I still experiencing severe anxiety, having panic attacks and racing negative thoughts.
17	615	I went up two cup sizes, and I'm experiencing more anxiety, but possibly due to the fact that I started it a few months after starting college.
17	616	Having had mild anxiety problems before, Loestrin has amplified them.
17	617	I do not recommend Loestrin to anybody with anxiety issues.
17	618	The only side effects I've had have been irritability/mood swings and anxiety after taking the pill.
17	619	I wanted shorter periods and had breast pain on my old pill, so I asked for a low dose bc.
17	620	I have been having horrible breast pain and was actually pretty scared until I saw the side effects some women have had taking this pill.
17	621	My mom was even convinced I was pregnant due to my symptoms, breast tenderness, but I decided to stay on this pill because I now have short periods.
17	622	Severely tender breasts 3 weeks out of the month.
17	623	Other than no period, I only had sore breasts at the start of pack 3, but that went away in 2 weeks.
17	624	HOWEVER, I got my first yeast infection after about 4 months on this pill.
17	625	The first month of taking Loestrin 24 Fe I developed a horrible yeast infection and bladder infection.
17	626	Again, on my second month of trying it, I got another yeast infection and slight bladder infection but used over the counter medicine to get rid of it this time.
17	627	I'm on my third month now and I feel a slight yeast infection starting to up come, but I'm eating a lot of yogurt to stop the infection.
17	628	I have been getting yeast infections 3-5 times a year since starting this pill.
17	629	My new doctor has informed me that this many yeast infections is, in fact, NOT normal.
17	630	I'm on my second pack of this pill and its been not so good for me I've been constantly getting yeast infections.
17	631	The Nuvaring made me have yeast infections, Mirena had me bleeding for 8 months.
17	632	Though, one side effect that I did always seem to have was yeast infections.
18	1	I will say it's helping with my acne and increasing my appetite (I'm thin so of course I want to eat more) but other than that it's a no for this pill for me.
18	2	I never experienced drastic mood swings, weight gain or acne.
18	3	Lutera also caused an increased appetite and caused acne on my face when I never have gotten serious acne before...
18	4	The acne I got from the other birth control has cleared up also.
18	5	I took this pills for 8 months and once I stopped taking it, acne
18	6	My acne got worse, when this was supposed to help.
18	7	Occasionally if I miss a pill by more than a few hours I might have some spotting, and on the first day I take the pill I sometimes have a slight headache and find myself a little moodier, but honestly, compared to the other products, which have given me acne, mood swings, nausea, and other problems, I would take the few mild symptoms from this product in a heartbeat.
18	8	I have not had any bad side effects except for occasional bloating, acne flare-up around when I'm getting my period, and some mood swings.
18	9	But one thing is my acne.
18	10	It feels and looks like cystic acne and I hate it.
18	11	A downside is I have been breaking out when usually I have no acne at all.
18	12	My skin is clear (I didn't have acne before either though), I have no mood swings & no spotting.
18	13	It helped clear up my acne, although during stressful times I still would get some small breakouts.
18	14	the only thing I'm wondering is if this is why i have persistent acne, it never occurred to me until recently because all doctors I've asked just say oh good you're on bc that should be helping.
18	15	Even if it is the cause of my acne i'm not sure i would switch because it works that good for me.
18	16	I also felt extremely nauseous, had horrible indigestion, my acne came back, & felt bloated the entire time I was on this pill.
18	17	My acne is so bad
18	18	Healthy, active and finally seeing my acne under control in one week!
18	19	I never have acne.
18	20	Constant headaches and acne were the main symptoms right before my period.
18	21	I do not have any headaches or acne and my periods are pain free.
18	22	I've been having birth control issues for about 2 years - first being on Mirena and having terrible cystic acne and depression, and then my doc recommended Lutera to add some hormones back into my system to help the acne.
18	23	This is low dosage and although I've seen my cystic acne go away (besides some coming at the time of the month) I still break out daily.
18	24	I break out on my face, back and shoulders and I haven't had this bad of acne since high school.
18	25	I went back and it was worse I didn't just have the rashes anymore but also bad acne, the doctor told me she'd never seen such a bad reaction from lutera but all I've read is bad reviews about how it makes you break out.
18	26	Also, no bad side effects such as acne, stomach pain, or severe discomfort in any form.
18	27	No weight gain, no severe acne, since I usually have a couple of pimples on my face no changes.
18	28	I have never had acne until I started this pill, and the painful acne was on my face, back, and shoulders.
18	29	No acne, break thru bleeding or decrease sex drive.
18	30	But it made my face break out like never before, i have never had acne just a pimple on my period.
18	31	No weight gain, no acne, it was perfect.
18	32	My face is pretty clear of acne and my breasts are definitely bigger, which is good (!)
18	33	I conquered all of my anxiety problems and stopped taking it, however I have gained 10 lbs since April and my acne has been horrible.
18	34	My acne has cleared up.
18	35	On a good note my skin is clear from acne and I went up a cup size.
18	36	It took two months but it definitely helped with her acne.
18	37	Fast forward two years later and now we are not sure what is going on but the old acne is coming back.
18	38	The only side effects i experienced were my acne clearing up and my breasts increasing a cup size.
18	39	On the bright side my acne was non existent and I noticed weight loss.
18	40	That has subsided, but I have gained a lot of weight, my hair and finger nails are growing rapidly, but are very brittle, my acne has gotten worse, my breasts are larger and more tender, and I get frequent headaches.
18	41	My acne has cleared up a lot which is nice.
18	42	Lutera is okay; my acne is manageable, no weight gain/loss, and no depression.
18	43	PROS- PERFECT acne free skin
18	44	I have been on Lutera for a good 5 months, it was suppose to be good for my acne but has made my acne worse.
18	45	Only con is acne which is very mild.
18	46	Pros, my acne has cleared up a little since using Lutera and also less depression.
18	47	I had mad rage, couldn't think clearly, emotional mess, and worst of all,  acne, something I never experienced before.
18	48	I have had acne for years, and it wasn't until I started birth control when I noticed how much it has been helping my skin.
18	49	I've been on it for a year now and I haven't gained any weight, I have less acne, and I don't crumple up on the bed for a straight week anymore!
18	50	I think my acne has cleared up, no real weight gain, some mood swings, but not very many or severe.
18	51	One is constipation and the other is acne.
18	52	I have never had an issue with acne but since taking Lutera I have had a breakout on my back.
18	53	This oral contraceptive completely erased my libido and gave me very painful acne.
18	54	I have been on it for only about a month and I have already noticed rapid weight loss, my breasts have gotten bigger (b cup to c cup) my acne cleared up and I actually seem much happier.
18	55	I have had headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, back acne, everything.
18	56	No weight gain or loss, nothing changed with my breasts, no acne, no spotting.
18	57	I originally started with Yaz, which gave me awful side effects such as acne, depression, weight gain.
18	58	Small things include: weight change (decreased-also my change in diet I think), more acne then before I was on this pill, slim to non mood-swings, slight spotting between periods, and definitely lighter periods.
18	59	Then over the past few months my PMDD got bad, I started breaking out, spotting between periods, migraines started kicking in and crazy mood swings.
18	60	I have had horrible stomach aches, skin breaking out, bloating and mood swings.
18	61	Like huge cystic pimples that no one wants to see.
18	62	The past two weeks I have broken out in small hard red pimples all over my cheeks and forehead and they have now spread to my neck.
18	63	All of that on top of the minor little annoyances like nausea, pimples, hot flashes, etc.
18	64	I really liked this birth control and wanted to continue using it, but after 3 months, it started causing big zits on my chin around the time of my period so I stopped.
18	65	I used to have debilitating cramps, heavy bleeding, nausea, and vomiting on the 1st day of every period.
18	66	Now I have mild cramps on day one and that's it.
18	67	The cramps were excruciatingly intense I'm 29 so this says a lot
18	68	I get cramps occasionally the first day or two on my period, but the cramps are not as bad as they used to be and not as frequent.
18	69	As much as I can remember the only side effect I had in the beginning were cramps.
18	70	Horrible cramps.
18	71	Second one was the same but the cramps would come and go in waves.
18	72	After that second time I never had cramps like that again.
18	73	My cramps were mild, my periods were only few days long and lighter.
18	74	I get stomach cramps a week before my period, been overly tired and been craving sweets when I normally don't like them.
18	75	My back hurts so unbelievable bad I can barely walk, I'm so nauseous, tired, terribly tired all the time and I already have period cramps.
18	76	My previously debilitating back and stomach cramps have become significantly less painful.
18	77	This was my first time going on birth control, and it was originally because I had such horrible headaches and cramps, but now I have a lighter period, headaches and cramps are rare, and I don't get depressed every month.
18	78	I have been using for 3 months and period is lighter with no cramps, don't get mood swings just a little sensitive a day before period.
18	79	It's doing the exact opposite of what it's supposed to be doing lightning your period and cramps.
18	80	My experience with it is not that bad, the only effects I've been having are spotting after my period, some changes of mood, more bleeding on my period, my breast has been getting bigger (tho I like this effect), and the cramps are a little stronger, no headaches, no depression,  no weight gain (but if I get some weight in the future it will be fantastic), and it has been helping me with my yeast infeccion, and the most important, still not pregnant.
18	81	I got the worst cramps of my life, headaches, had volatile mood swings, seemed to have gain weight on this pill.
18	82	My period is much lighter, cramps are the same, i haven't bloated like a balloon, etc.
18	83	I had instances where I would be interested in having sex but couldn't enjoy it due to painful cramps.
18	84	I used to have awful period cramps, since I started this pill I haven't had any.
18	85	I am going through really painful cramps at the moment, which I haven't had for years!!!!!!
18	86	This bc has almost negated my cramps during the placebo/period week, my skin seems clearer in general though when I do get a pimple it's harder to the touch, my breasts got a little fuller (no sensitivity), and I'm bloated/constipated during the 3 active pill weeks ALL THE TIME.
18	87	The only bad side effect I'm having is horrible cramps during my period.
18	88	I've had a baby before and the cramps feel like early or Braxton hicks contractions.
18	89	I started taking lutera because when I was on my period I had horrible cramps, nausea and my skin when pale.
18	90	There have been no mood swings, no weight gain and I have seen a decrease in my period cramps and the length of my period.
18	91	I use to get severe cramps but since taking Lutera its been all better.
18	92	Not to mention it's made me incredibly depressed and now I have cramps 24/7 and not just during my period.
18	93	I started taking lutera because I have horrible pain and insane cramps, hot flashes, etc on my period.
18	94	It worked as far as birth control and took my cramps and pain away right away which was a plus.
18	95	After 3 days of stopping, I started having light brown discharge and horrible cramps.
18	96	I had 6-7 day periods with bad cramps before & they became 3 day periods with absolutely no cramps.
18	97	I'm shedding a lot more and have cramps and back ache from time to time.
18	98	The biggest benefit was that it regulated my period and made my cramps go away!!
18	99	After about 4  months I  had no period at all:  no spotting,  no  bleeding,  no pms,  no cramps,  no  mood swings.
18	100	My cramps were tolerable if at all.
18	101	No weight gain at all which makes it great, my periods are regular always on time, and cramps got better.
18	102	I dont have cramps or bleed near as bad, however the day before I start my period and the day after the last sugar pill I'm an absolute nightmare.
18	103	In the first 2 months I had spotting all the time, crazy mood swings, intense cravings and cramps around PMS time and was loosing a dramatic amount of hair.
18	104	Clear skin, no weight gain but I lost some, no mood swings, no cramps, no tender breasts, no pregnancies.
18	105	My periods are lighter and my cramps don't hurt nearly as bad.
18	106	I really don't like how it is giving me cramps (I'm nowhere near my period week) and COMPLETELY took away my sex drive.
18	107	Periods are light, short, barely any cramps.
18	108	Before Lutera I would get horrible cramps and now my cramps don't bother me as much.
18	109	It makes my period lighter and the cramps aren't that bad.
18	110	I have little to no cramps and before I had horrible cramps and heavy, heavy flow.
18	111	When my cramps got to the point of being completely debilitating, however, I decided it was time to start my first trial with birth control.
18	112	When I first got on the pill it made me nauseous, had headaches, body aches, and cramps.
18	113	Now my period only lasts 5 days and light flow and barely any cramps!
18	114	My hair was falling out, horrible cramps and bad headaches.
18	115	Had horrible cramps, breast soreness awful mood swings, weight gain (at least 5-7lbs), and very odd periods (some would be heavy heavy, then the next month barely anything).
18	116	My periods are much lighter and I almost never get cramps.
18	117	I used to have severe cramps and heavy bleeding but Lutera helped.
18	118	I do not bleed as much and my cramps are nothing compared to what they were.
18	119	I have had strange back pains, as if it was period cramps, but other than that, I've had no side effects.
18	120	I started taking Lutera because I had bad cramps and my doctor recommended it.
18	121	It works great, I used to get very heavy periods with mild cramps almost everyday.
18	122	Now with Lutera I get lighter periods and almost no cramps.
18	123	I did gain some weight, I get a few stomach cramps, and my breasts hurt a little from time to time.
18	124	Before, I had terrible cramps around my first day of my menstrual cycle, and now, I have very mild cramps.
18	125	My doctor started me on Yaz, which gave me cramps every day and made me extremely moody.
18	126	I used to experience moderate to severe cramps the week before and during my period.
18	127	On Lutera my cramps are much milder, only last about 2 days, and I can exercise without taking medicine.
18	128	I would vomit and be out of commission due to terrible cramps.
18	129	I rarely cramp or get bloated.
18	130	I bleed and cramp less.
18	131	No mood issues, no added cramping.
18	132	With lutera my periods last about 3-4 days with little to no cramping.
18	133	My period is light and I hardly experienced any cramping (in the past, I've had to miss work because I've been in so much pain).
18	134	My periods were on time every month, I had no severe cramping, my mood swings died down a lot and it protected me.
18	135	After that, my periods were light and the only side effect that stuck around was some breast tenderness and mild cramping on the first day of my period.
18	136	I say ok because I started the pack 3 days before my period ..worst mistake ever.. my period was super heavy for 4 days and had really bad cramping ..My advice for first timers is wait until you end your period and start taking the pill right after.
18	137	Because I didn't wait now I have my period again (this time it's really light.. still cramping) hopefully by this next pack my period is on track.
18	138	No unusual cramping, spotting, etc.
18	139	I really liked the pill when I was single (mainly took it for cramping and lighter periods).
18	140	Each month, I come to the inactive pills and get severe cramping as if I'm finally going to get it, and I don't.
18	141	Also, I've noticed occasional, slight cramping.
18	142	Side effects for me: my boobs are larger and sore; I was a little crampy the first few weeks; I get moody around 6:30pm each night like clockwork (I'm guessing due to the hormone levels dropping in my body?)
18	143	Lucky for me, never any spotting or random bleeding, took my PMS symptoms from severe to barely there... Cramps?
18	144	Toward the end I started spotting the 4th day of the third week, and I am on the 3rd day of my period week- and so far I have been spotting for 7 days.
18	145	Had spotting for an entire month and a half when I first swapped to this pill, and I also didn't have a period after the first two packs (due to the spotting).
18	146	On my third pack I wasn't spotting at all, but that's also when I received my 1st period.
18	147	I have not had any spotting.
18	148	I have been spotting here and there for about a week or so but my actual period was so short compared to how it normally is!
18	149	In the past I have taken Orthotricyclen and it made me slightly nauseous and I had some light spotting if I took a pill later than usual.
18	150	My boobs are a little tender and I do notice brown discharge/some spotting, but I haven't experienced any truly negative side effects.
18	151	While taking this birth control I experience headaches, mood swings, depression, weight gain, drop in sex drive, and extremely long periods.my period will last 8-9days with occasional spotting between periods and other months 3-4weeks (<--maybe 3times since I started 2yrs ago) I was told this would make period lighter... Yeah not as heavy but longer :(   After the 1st yr i spoke with my ob to make sure I didn't have any issues like fibroids, etc... And everything was normal so I decided to keep trying Lutera in the hopes my body would adjust.
18	152	This pill actually stopped spotting that was occurring from my previous pill.
18	153	I accidentally started it when I was spotting and and week later my period came.
18	154	I think my mood is changing only because I am tired of spotting every day!
18	155	With Lutera, I have no breakthrough bleeding or spotting, no headaches or body aches, and no weight gain.
18	156	But the last few months I've been spotting the week before my period.
18	157	But for my last two periods I started spotting for the whole third week of pills and then having a very heavy period, so my doctor is putting me on a higher dose of a similar medicine, I'm just hoping it is exactly the same but with a normal period.
18	158	So far with Lutera, my mood swings are gone but I have spotting after hitting the 2nd week mark.
18	159	Slight headache and light spotting.
18	160	I started spotting on the second week of starting the pill and it lasted till it was time to get my period.
18	161	Lately I've been having more brown spotting about a week before my period, it's lasted the entire week, and then my regular period starts.
18	162	Other then issues with spotting and my period starting early each month, the pill has been fine.
18	163	Hopefully the spotting will stop soon or I'll need to switch to an entire new pill.
18	164	The first month I spotted after two weeks, but once I finished my period and started the second pack, I haven't had any spotting since.
18	165	I haven't had any spotting, tenderness, or mood swings but I hear some people get those.
18	166	Every so often I would spot between periods on Lutera, but now that I've experienced the mood swings of Aviane I don't mind a little spotting.
18	167	I have taken this pills for 3 months this has turned out to be the worst birth control pills I have gained 20 pounds on it without changing my diet I have had anxiety, no energy, severe bloating I spot in between periods I'll be switching back to my old birth control $30 per month copay this ones were covered at 100% but not worth it
18	168	Some months I have 2 periods within 3 weeks, and I spot whenever.
18	169	I've noticed how if I'm late taking my pill each day, even by two hours, I'll spot or even start my period early.
18	170	However, since then every time I have my period the pain comes back and it's always in the same spot.
18	171	I did spot after receiving my period.
18	172	Now I am breastfeeding and my doctor put me back on it after the progesterone only pill made me spot.
18	173	Over the years my sex drive went down & spotted between periods.
18	174	), and spotted a week before my period.
18	175	I have gotten 5 migraines in the second month (migraines are rare for me) and everyday I would have a mild headache, it was annoying, also I've felt dizzy right with my headache.
18	176	I only had a headache and slightly nauseous on the first day of taking the pill and after that I was fine.
18	177	I always experienced mood swings during my periods and I think i'm just about the same with birth control, no more no less (yoga helps a LOT with my insane moods), sometimes i'll get a headache from the pill sometimes but lasts about half an hour.
18	178	I had a really bad headache before this period.
18	179	This is my first time being on ANY birth control ever..I have no nausea or any sickness.. slight headache the first couple of days taking it..
18	180	I started it a month and half ago and I am experiencing really bad headaches and stomach aches, but this I believe is quite normal when you start out on birth control.
18	181	I take my pill about 12 pm everyday but towards the end of the day I'm feeling so nauseous, also developed a lot of headaches; which is not normal for me and, there was some tenderness in my breasts.
18	182	I do get headaches more often and for some reason I get constipated as well
18	183	Only downside is having to remember to take it at the same time every day...and for the first week or two I just felt a little off and had some headaches and breast tenderness.
18	184	I was recently misdiagnosed with PMDD Bc I was having severe mood swings, headaches, anxiety, depression etc.
18	185	Everyday I feel nauseas, weak, headaches, heart palpitations and somewhat down.
18	186	But with Lutera it was a horrible experience, Lots of headaches, low sex drive, MANY mood swings/depression.
18	187	Week one in the second pack, the nausea was back and accompanied by headaches.
18	188	Also had outbursts of anger, extreme fatigue, skin got oilier, and had headaches throughout the month.
18	189	The longer I've been off it now for a week the worse it is, heavier discharge, headaches, bodyhurts and I have bleeding
18	190	This birth control made me nauseous, gave me headaches, caused me to gain weight, gave me HORRIBLE break outs, and even made me sick.
18	191	My only complaint was I got horrible headaches right before my period and during my period.
18	192	I only switched to something different because the headaches were too much and I got a new doctor and she said that there were too much hormones in this and lowered my dose of estrogen with a different birth control.
18	193	Only the first month I experienced mild headaches and morning sickness but I think it was my body adjusting to it.
18	194	I am prone to headaches, and I've gained quite a bit of weight that is nearly impossible to lose.
18	195	I do get headaches quite a bit but it can be from something totally different.
18	196	The first month I experienced some mild headaches and irregular bleeding, nothing serious.
18	197	I've gotten headaches while on Lutera, sometimes they get pretty bad.
18	198	Ever since I've been taking this pill, the cons are increase in appetite, stomach pains, and headaches, and a little weight gain.
18	199	I've been thinking of switching to another pill, cause the stomach pains and headaches are horrible.
18	200	In the beginning I've experienced headaches, not to bad though.
18	201	People were saying they were having severe headaches, hair loss, decreased sex drive, etc.
18	202	I've also had headaches but not sure if its from the pill and I had my period for 2 weeks straight but my doctor said its because body is getting used to the pill.
18	203	It does its job, but I'm tired, extremely moody, border-line depressed, and I get headaches.
18	204	I don't feel like I need to eat often or more, and I have no nausea/dizziness or headaches.
18	205	It has caused me unbearable migraines and a bit of vision problems.
18	206	It made me get severe migraines and the periods were too light.
18	207	Unfortunately I've started to get migraines with aura and therefore had to come off Lutera.
18	208	The only reason I give it an eight was the first three months I had horrible migraines but just figured that was my body adjusting.
18	209	And I've had migraines that I've never had before, while on this pill.
18	210	I got colds, flu, bronchitis, and was always having migraines.
18	211	My sex drive actually increased but it's still a no bueno for me.
18	212	Since my last birth control caused extreme moodiness, decrease in sex drive, Lutera was a lot better with those side effects.
18	213	My sex drive was "ok" it wasn't completely decreased but it could have been better considering I am 19.
18	214	But after 2 years I've lost my sex drive almost completely and have a lot of trouble with natural lubrication.
18	215	As far as sex drive goes, I'm not sure what everyone is saying about loss, because if anything I've gained.
18	216	Though, both my sex drive and lubrication situation could be due to my age compared to other ladies on this page!
18	217	also my sex drive was WAY too high when I went off of it!
18	218	My only complaint is that it did kill my sex drive, which was annoying.
18	219	I took the pill for about 6 month the first 3 months were the worst for me i was cranky my sex drive went down the drain i was dry down there and i became depressed after i started to feel better just bad cramps.. the pill is effective just the side effects are the worst
18	220	Within weeks, it made me more irritable/sensitive (I would cry for no reason) and my sex drive became nonexistent.
18	221	It increased my mood swings, made me feel as if I was on my cycle for about a week and a half (which only lasts normally 5 days), decreased my sex drive, caused me to discharge a lot, and caused a drastic weight gain (at least 15lbs)...only gave it 2/10 because I didn't get pregnant...
18	222	Before I was on Lutera- I was on Lo Loestin FE (which was awful!- I would bleed literally two weeks out of the month, had no sex drive and gained 10 lbs).
18	223	After switching to Lutera, which I have been on for a month now, my mood swings have been consistent (even though I cried when a dog commercial came on), I have actually lost weight, there is no break through bleeding, and my sex drive is back to normal, AND this is covered a 100% by my insurance.
18	224	Some how my sex drive increased though which is the only reason I tried to give it 3 months and gave it 2 stars instead of 1 but the severe bloating, weight gain and high anxiety in the middle of my cycle were unbearable.
18	225	And dont even think about having sex.. i have no sex drive at all.
18	226	I have had almost constant diarrhea, a couple of mood swings, my period lasted nine days (rather than my usual four), nausea, hot flashes at night (age 21), I have had a hard time staying asleep, and not too much of a sex drive left.
18	227	It's helped with all mood swings I had prior to taking the pill and it hasn't altered my sex drive.
18	228	Didn't change my mood or my sex drive, and periods have been much more bearable.
18	229	It does not seem to have made my sex drive low at all, but that could be something to do with my age.
18	230	My sex drive is way higher than it was before taking this pill.
18	231	Haven't experienced any mood swings, decrease in sex drive.
18	232	I'm no longer depressed and my sex drive increased.
18	233	I realized having been on this pill I have no sex drive whatsoever and I'm completely dry which causes pain when I'm having sex.
18	234	I cry over the smallest things, get irritated fast, felt weight gain & my sex drive is crazy to the point I want it all the time.
18	235	My sex drive is slightly lower.
18	236	Sex drive is actually up the wall.
18	237	I have no sex drive.
18	238	My sex drive to be honest is normal.
18	239	I have had terrible experiences with different pills in the past (25 lb weight gain in a month, loss of sex drive completely - it hurt to have sex because I couldn't get wet, mood swings) so I decided to not take the pill any more and rely on withdrawal.
18	240	The only side effect I have noticed was a decreased sex drive (not by much).
18	241	After a few months, my sex drive came back and I lost 6 pounds.
18	242	Some side effects that I have noticed are enlarged and tender breast and decrease in sex drive.
18	243	The only downside is that my sex drive is much lower on the pill.
18	244	I was a little bit more emotional then usual and one major thing that affected me was that my sex drive was virtually non-existent.
18	245	I have experienced a few minor side effects such as stomach pain and decreased sex drive but all in all I like it and don't want to change to another pill.
18	246	The only side effects I experienced was thinning hair and a real drop in my sex drive.
18	247	HOWEVER, I have next to no sex drive.
18	248	My libido is completely gone now.
18	249	It's effective in preventing pregnancy, however I've completely LOST my libido.
18	250	I totally lost my libido, like i'd rather watch the rain fall than have sex, I am the crankiest thing and I'm 1000 x more sensitive than i used to be.
18	251	I've started on Lutera due to the fact that my last birth control pill caused mood swings and low libido.
18	252	Weight gain?
18	253	My doctor explained the pill itself does not cause weight gain, but increases your appetite and helps slow metabolism.
18	254	I have had NO weight gain and in fact lost a few pants sizes.
18	255	No noticeable weight gain yet so so far, it's been pretty pleasant.
18	256	My main concern, if I'm being honest, was weight gain.
18	257	No weight gain so far, boobs got a little bigger.
18	258	I have no weight gain either.
18	259	If anything else it has calmed me down a bit (I'm really emotional/anxious) I haven't had any weight gain or anything crazy.
18	260	I've had no weight gain, and have actually lost around 40lbs since I switched from the Depo shot to Lutera.
18	261	As soon as I stopped taking it I felt 1000 times better, I feel like myself again, and now just have to work on getting back into shape because of the weight gain.
18	262	No side effects, no weight gain, no mood swing, none of those.
18	263	No breakouts, weight gain or bleeding.
18	264	Other than the weight gain it's ok but I don't think I will stay on it.
18	265	I, myself am 5'1 and weight about 145 no sudden weight gain.
18	266	I haven't had any weight gain.
18	267	No weight gain, no mood swings or no loss of sleep either.
18	268	The weight gain has made me depressed and self conscious, beginning to think this pill is not worth taking.
18	269	I have had no weight gain, actually lost 2 pants sizes, no unusual mood swings, breasts went down a cup size but seem perkier, and no babies.
18	270	As I said, with OTC Lo I have experienced all kinds of side effects from weight gain and face swelling (fluid retention) to hair loss, 9-day periods and mood swings.
18	271	I did not notice any weight gain and my moods were pretty regular.
18	272	At first I was scared to take it due to the possible side effects, and weight gain!
18	273	I never had any nausea with the pill, but I did have some weight gain {about 6 pounds, which did not make me happy!
18	274	My breasts definitely got bigger but besides that not much weight gain as others have mentioned.
18	275	The weight gain makes me sad.
18	276	Other than that, my skin has gotten much clearer (I used to have spots here and there and now I don't), my periods are shorter and predictable, there was no weight gain (I actually lost weight) and breasts stayed the same.
18	277	I haven't felt moody or depressed, and I've experienced no weight gain.
18	278	So far, the only side effect I've experienced is minor soreness in my breasts, and they've actually gotten significantly larger- kid you not, B to a small D.  No weight gain, and less of an appetite, actually.
18	279	I think I am going to switch birth control because of the weight gain.
18	280	It's effective, no weight gain, no mood swings.
18	281	But, I'm still sticking it out- no weight gain, I've started taking B-complex which REALLY helps.
18	282	I haven't had any weight gain or issues with mood swings.
18	283	I have been on this birth control for almost 4 weeks and I have experienced some side effects such as weight gain.
18	284	The pill however like any other birth control will cause slight weight gain, so it's wise to cut back on the amount of calories you consume while on this pill.
18	285	I was on Lo(lo) and I gained 25 pounds in 3 months.
18	286	Then I gained 20 pounds on this B.C.
18	287	I gained a lot of weight, about 15lbs and my boobs gained cup size- doesn't sound bad but it's weird.
18	288	My appetite seems to have decreased but I've gained a lot of weight on it.
18	289	I've also gained 0 lbs.
18	290	I have very light, short periods, I'm no more moody than I would normally be, and haven't gained any weight.
18	291	Since I started taking it my breasts got huge, I gained weight, I've been depressed and my sleep pattern has been thrown off.
18	292	Within 3 months I have gained over 35lbs- not even in my boobs.
18	293	I eat healthy, exercise daily - and still gained weight.
18	294	However, I've gained 17 pounds in 2 months!
18	295	This is a horrible birth control I've tried several and this is by far the worst I've been taking it for about 8 months have gained several pounds, have terrible mood swings, most days I feel sick and have lost a lot of my hair.
18	296	My only complaint is that I gained weight.
18	297	I gained 10 lbs in two years.
18	298	I can't tell if I gained weight or not because of this but if I did, it's less than 5lbs.
18	299	It made me bloated I went up a cup size not to mention I gained 40 lbs yes 40 lbs.
18	300	On the plus side, I haven't gained any weight and my skin has cleared up a little.
18	301	Unlike most people, I haven't had breakouts (in fact, my skins been quite clear) amd I havent gained weight.
18	302	Initially I gained about 5 pounds but that's probably the case with every BC and you can work to keep it off.
18	303	Well....50 pounds gained later I'm not very happy with this pill.
18	304	Previously, I have been taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for about 2.5 years and I have gained 12 extra pounds to my normal weight.
18	305	Having switched to Lutera, I noticed the difference - it took about 4 days for these extraz around my waist area to disappear, I gained half-cup size, I feel very lady-like compared to the OTC Lo (don't laugh but this is how the previous pill affected me), my periods are down to 5 days and are relatively painless.It agrees with my body.
18	306	In this time, I've gained some weight.
18	307	I feel like I've gained a little bit of weight but I can't blame anything but myself.
18	308	I've been on it for 2 months now and though it's effective,  I have to say it makes me a little nauseous at the start of a new pack and I've gained like 10 lbs.
18	309	I have gained some weight but I'm working on losing it.
18	310	I gained about 5 lbs.
18	311	My skin is the clearest it's ever been, my breasts grew a little, I gained a little weight, but it seems to work for me quite nicely!
18	312	I've been eating constantly and have gained about 10 pounds since I went on it.
18	313	I've gained 7 pounds so far which I love since I have a fast metabolism.
18	314	I gained a LOT of weight.
18	315	I haven't gained any weight & my breast size hasn't increased & isn't tender.
18	316	I've gained about 15 lbs in 2 months of being on it, I'm extremely moody and borderline depressed, always tired, feel spaced out a lot and I don't have much of an appetite, ever.
18	317	I have gained about 8 pounds and I crave sweet foods even more than I used to.
18	318	I gained about 7 pounds.
18	319	However, I have gained weight - about 20 lbs.
18	320	I have been using it for over a month now and I have not gained any weight.
18	321	I have not really gained any weight, which is one of the main reasons my doctor put me on this pill.
18	322	I haven't gained any weight and my skin has been flawless.
18	323	I went back on the pill in the fall of 2016, I didn't experience any nausea like I did with previous pills which was great.
18	324	I did experience some nausea the first week but none after that.
18	325	The first two weeks I noticed nausea, listlessness, and mild depression, but thought nothing of it because I was starting a new dose of hormones.
18	326	The other side effects like dry eyes with contacts, nausea here there is bearable .
18	327	Also, my nausea has gotten way worse.
18	328	Well, I did experience some of them on this pill (mostly mood swings, nausea) but only for a few days.
18	329	It's been working pretty well for me, but I had a horrible period, mood swings and nausea in the first month I took it.
18	330	Haven't had any side effects besides really bad nausea on the second day of the pill.
18	331	I did feel slight nausea and a loss of appetite, but I'm not complaining.
18	332	I experienced nausea quite often during the first couple of packs.
18	333	When I first started taking it, I had extremely bad nausea for the first week that was impossible to cope with.
18	334	After a few weeks of dramatic mood swings, the nausea around period week woke me up in the middle of the night!
18	335	Waves of nausea that didn't allow me to eat for almost entire day.
18	336	My only side effects are nausea and my fiance has told me that my breasts are looking much bigger.
18	337	And one of my recent periods I stayed nauseous with no appetite and slept every chance I got.
18	338	I do get nauseous taking it.
18	339	First few weeks I felt nauseous in mornings an head aches on and off but then they went away.
18	340	I haven't noticed any terrible side effects except for when I take the first pill of a new pack - if I eat or drink anything within the first few hours of taking the pill I will feel nauseous.
18	341	I started this birth control because after taking my other for 2 years it started making me nauseous during my period.
18	342	The first two months of taking it I felt pretty nauseous & my breasts were a little tender.
18	343	First time ever being on anything and at first I was very nauseous the first week taking it.
18	344	I felt very nauseous almost all the time in the first month.
18	345	I feel nauseous constantly though.
18	346	I don't like how it makes me nauseous a lot, but maybe that's just with the starting months.
18	347	It makes me nauseous to the point where everything is spinning.
18	348	Felt a bit nauseous when I first started taking this but other than that I highly recommend it.
18	349	The only thing I have experienced is a nauseous feeling, but nothing that really makes me lose my appetite.
18	350	In fact, after the first couple of weeks (where I was nauseous quite a bit), the only side effect I notice is slightly fuller breasts.
18	351	I feel dizzy and weak most of the day and with two kids to care for, we all know that it doesn't matter if we are sick; we still have to be responsible and care for them.
18	352	The first month was fine, the second month my period lasted for 18 days, the third month I began to feel dizzy the day before my period would start, I would get terribly sick  before each period after that.
18	353	Upon taking the pill I've had trouble focusing and getting dizzy.
18	354	I do have a mood swing usually about once a month where I cry about anything and everything for 2 days.
18	355	At first it was great, I didn't have any side effects except for mood swings now and then.
18	356	when I first started taking it I had some mood swings, but now I'm ok.
18	357	I feel even-keeled and happy, and did not experience the usual intense mood swings and food cravings of my cycle.
18	358	Not to mention the constant mood swings or depression.
18	359	Mood swings.
18	360	I noticed immediate mood swings within the first 2 weeks of taking it, I had a little trouble sleeping one night & literally started sobbing out of no where (mind you I'm not a very emotional person).
18	361	MAJOR mood swings and depression.
18	362	Horrible mood swings!
18	363	This pill made me relapse in my depression and caused the most annoying mood swings.
18	364	Ever since I've starting taking this medicine I've had the worst mood swings I'll go from laughing to pure anger then crying.
18	365	I would have the most worst mood swings and get so mad that I would just blow up.
18	366	I also started to get crazy mood swings and would snap at everything/everyone.
18	367	I took Lutera for 3 & a half months & I've stopped because of the mood swings.
18	368	My skin is clearer, my breasts are fuller, & no more mood swings.
18	369	Haven't experienced any mood swings.
18	370	I've previously taken other forms of BC which I had experienced crazy mood swings.
18	371	I do have mood swings ever since I started Lutera but I mostly just cry easier when I'm PMSing and that's it.
18	372	I was scared to take birth control pills because I recently had a tough fight with depression, and I didn't want to go through mood swings during the adjustment period for these pills.
18	373	I've noticed that my mood swings have gotten terrible.
18	374	I finally realized my mood swings are huge.
18	375	Also I've been having insane mood swings.
18	376	I have been taking this pill for 5 months and I have noticed HUGE mood swings, feel depressed but I have lost weight.
18	377	This is my first time on birth control (I am 22) and the only negative side effect of Lutera seems to be mood swings during weeks 1 or 2.
18	378	It didn't break me out, cause me to gain weight, or have any mood swings.
18	379	My mood swings are crazy.
18	380	In addition it has caused significant mood swings.
18	381	Horrible mood swings.
18	382	On this pill I've lost my crazy appetite that I used to have, my breasts feel like they've gotten smaller, I don't have mood swings, or feel depressed or anything.
18	383	My mood swings were terribly out of control, bleeding was always there and depression occurred.
18	384	Switching to Lutera was a good idea because it is a low dose birth control which has helped my mood swings tremendously!
18	385	Then I started getting really bad mood swings.
18	386	My skin is clear, I went from a B to a D cup, and best of all, no mood swings!
18	387	I got mood swings that most of the time is controllable but still I shouldn't randomly start crying.
18	388	I've had mood swings and really bad depression and emotional.
18	389	I do not get mood swings or anything like that.
18	390	I have mild mood swings but thats how I was before I started Lutera so I doubt its due to the pill.
18	391	I haven't been taking the pill for YEARS, so I am no expert, but so far I have experienced a more controllable period, tender and growing breasts, even skin tone and weird mood swings in the beginning.
18	392	My mood swings are a little uncontrollable though.
18	393	I have also had some mood swings but not severe.
18	394	My mood swings may have increased slightly, but overall I've been very very satisfied with this birth control and I hope it continues.
18	395	I did not gain weight or have fuller breasts or experience any mood swings.
18	396	I started Lutera about 2 weeks ago, and the only side effects I have noticed is slight tenderness and swelling of my breasts (not really a problem) and occasional mood swings, (which are easy to control if your aware you are having mood swings).
18	397	I had been on Ortho-Cyclen for 5 years and had no problems with mood swings.
18	398	I tried Ortho Tricyclen-Lo and had horrible mood swings and cravings.
18	399	I was a little moody for the 1st week or 2 that I started taking the pill, but I'm also being treated for depression so I don't know that I can attribute my mood swings to anything in particular.
18	400	I didn't notice any mood changes, though.
18	401	I'm extremely nervous though because I went to pick up my bc pills today & was told that they are no longer making lutera.
18	402	I was nervous as I had read about all the horrible side effects of birth control pills.
18	403	I was quiet nervous about talking this pill, because I have had such bad experience with the shot.
18	404	Honestly, after reading all the reviews and side effects all over the internet I was pretty nervous.
18	405	Very nervous about the switch but we'll see what happens.
18	406	I got off lutera last Friday and I still feel depressed and anxious.
18	407	The change in hormones affected me adversely as I became irritable and anxious for no reason apparent.
18	408	I've been overly emotional and anxious beyond belief.
18	409	All this coming from a person who has never had an anxious bone in her body until I started this pill.
18	410	I also suffer from anxiety and mild bipolar disorder, so I was worried this pill would make my symptoms worse, but I'm happy and healthy as could be right now!
18	411	On the 4th month I had anxiety and I kept brushing it off because I thought it came from work stress by the 5th and 6th month I had anxiety almost every single day!
18	412	I went to the doc and they gave me anxiety meds and antidepressants.
18	413	I kept on struggling with anxiety and depression.
18	414	I then started getting UTIs (which i never had before), severe anxiety, and hair loss( clumps were coming out in the shower!
18	415	Developed severe depression and anxiety about a year after taking the pill.
18	416	I developed severe anxiety whIle on lutera.
18	417	I noticed myself starting to get depressed again, and my anxiety was constant all day.
18	418	On my 4th pack I started noticing I had very bad anxiety, I was sweating in my sleep, feeling zoned out after a full nights sleep I hated how it made me feel.
18	419	This pill now gave me anxiety and had to get on a depressant.
18	420	The other half of it was horrible for me: it gave me AWFUL anxiety.
18	421	All of my symptoms would come and go (except for the anxiety).
18	422	I did experience some breast tenderness my first week which wasn't too bad.
18	423	The only thing I have noticed is a little bit of breast tenderness before my period and I only get slightly moody at PMS time.
18	424	For the first 4 months I'd have tender breasts for the entire month.
18	425	The only side effect I had was sore breasts for the first 2 months then they went away.
18	426	My breasts hurt, and I was extremely aggressive during my month on this pill.
18	427	I'd rather go back to using condoms even if i'm not a fan.. oh and my breasts hurt like they're gonna explode at any moment.
18	428	When I started I had a few side effects, a little moody, urinary tract infections and yeast infections but nothing I could not handle.
18	429	Ever since I have changed to this birth control I have had a lot of infections from urinary tract infections to yeast infections to bacterial vaginosis.
19	1	I have problem skin, and this drug gave me pretty extreme hormonal acne around my jawline that only got worse overtime.Please be careful if you have past experience with acne or if you notice the acne isn't going away!!!
19	2	I got acne scars that are just now fading.
19	3	I do not experience headaches as much as I did before and I have not had any weight gain, emotional distress, or acne of any sort.
19	4	I want to switch to a birth control that will help to acne but am not sure if I can switch mid cycle.
19	5	I was on birth control for 6 years with no problem until my gyno switched it on me and the new one gave me cystic acne.
19	6	I should note that I have never had acne or suffered from prolonged breakouts.
19	7	My skin cleared up dramatically, I would get cystic acne and this pill in combination with tretinoin from my dermatologist has drastically improved my skin.
19	8	I did stop taking this pill for about 6 months and I immediately gained weight and my acne returned.
19	9	Long term it did what a birth control is suppose to do, clear acne, didn't gain much weight (I'm very petite) and had my periods every month.
19	10	I have not experienced any acne, mood swings, weight gain, or libido changes whatsoever.
19	11	I got on it to gain weight and to help my acne breakouts.
19	12	I have not had sex while on it yet so I cannot speak to that, but I have not gained weight from it nor have I gotten more acne than I had before.
19	13	I was put on it to help my acne and it really made it a lot worse.
19	14	I started taking this BC because I had severe painful acne all over my face and the my doc decided since I wasn't in any BC this should help clear up my acne and be protected at the same time.
19	15	Im getting acne all over again.
19	16	My chest acne has pretty much cleared up, my face is eh though.
19	17	I never got acne, besides maybe 1 zit every month or so.
19	18	When I first started this birth Control, I started to get some acne.
19	19	But this acne did not clear up.
19	20	Over the months, my skin has gotten to the point where I don't want to leave my house without face makeup to cover up my acne and scarring.
19	21	My gynecologist suggested this birth control for me because I asked her for something that can help with my acne.
19	22	First of all, it made my acne worst.
19	23	My acne has cleared up a little already and I've noticed I've been slightly more energetic than when I was taking Levora which always made me tired.
19	24	I've always had really light acne, & have never had anxiety, Being on this pill I am not myself at all.
19	25	Low self esteem, I get new acne everyday, I've had my period twice in one month.
19	26	I switched from the implant in my arm to this pill because I was told it would help with my acne and my heavy periods!
19	27	I hope I have good luck like a lot of the woman on here saying it helped with  acne and periods.
19	28	No relief from headaches and acne on this pill though, and made bleeding worse!
19	29	Although, it did seem to help with some acne.
19	30	I began to realize that the pill has been the reason for my extremely bad acne (that began when I started this pill), depression, and mental fog that I always seem to be caught in.
19	31	Now that I am on Microgestin, my periods became only 3-4 days, I still have terrible cramps, I'm still spotty if I'm not consistent with taking my pills on time but my skin has been clear even transitioning between the two, even though my family tends to have terrible acne, I somehow got blessed along the way.
19	32	It helped a lot with my acne, it went from breaking out everyday to maybe once or twice every two weeks or so.
19	33	I've gained weight, feel bloated often, started getting acne again at age 32, feel tired/moody/depressed with less interest in sex...but the worst is the headaches.
19	34	I have not gained any weight nor have I experienced any acne, if anything, I've lost 3 pounds and my skin is glowy (mind you, I am a couch potato).
19	35	My first time taking birth control my gyno put me on lo loestrin Fe 1/20 and my hormonal acne cleared up, my sex drive was fine, overall great pill.
19	36	Ever since I started taking microgestin I have had horrible acne and started off with horrible mood swings and I'm on month four right now and have recently been experiencing some anxiety and nausea I think due to this pill.
19	37	Microgestin Fe is horrible I do not recommend especially if you are prone to having acne which is one of the main reasons I started taking BC.
19	38	I haven't had problem with acne in years and now all of a sudden my face has been breaking out!
19	39	I've always had acne prone skin and it hasn't helped or worsened it.
19	40	Ive been on this pill for two months and so far so good ..I have acne prone skin but this pill doesnt give me more acne.
19	41	acne acne acne acne acne.
19	42	If you have acne prone skin like me please DO NOT take this medication.
19	43	Make sure you are on something that is MEANT for acne (yasmin, yaz, ortho tri cyclen, sprintec, etc) as microgestin is not specifically meant for acne and can actually make your skin worse.
19	44	My body never "adjusted" to the hormones as my gyno said and my breakouts just got worse and worse until i finally decided to stop taking it (9 months in) and my acne finally cleared.
19	45	From the very second day I was on this, I've had horrible cystic acne all over my body which I've never had issue with before and I'm in my mid-30s.
19	46	I took it for more than a year and had super predictable and light periods with almost no cramps, my acne was absolutely relinquished, no weight gain, no mood swings throughout my cycle, and no pregnancy (the most important).
19	47	It also made my skin break out despite the fact that I have a good skincare routine and rarely experience acne.
19	48	On top of all that the acne won't go away!!!
19	49	I have no acne, but I'm not sure if that's because of the pill.
19	50	I haven't personally had the side effects of low sex drive or acne; my skin actually has cleared up a lot since starting it.
19	51	Since being on this pill (for 6 weeks) I've gained 10 lbs, I'm so increadibly moody that I'm constantly fed up with everyone/crying/stressed to the point I can't handle basic every day things without breaking down... My skin looks horrible, I never have acne, and my face, back & chest are covered...
19	52	I have experienced EXTREME mood issues, panic attacks, cramping, fatigue, restlessness, no sex drive, and also terrible acne mostly along my jaw line and my shoulders.
19	53	There was two pros to this pill which prevented me from pregnancy 100% and clears my skin of acne.
19	54	From the start of the pills I never had any symptoms of sickness, acne or mood swings.
19	55	On top of that my acne has gotten awful in my adult hood but this pill made it worse!
19	56	I started getting large painful cyistic acne on my forehead.
19	57	I originally took it to cure my severe acne but it also helped with my severe cramps and heavy bleeding.
19	58	They must have not stuck to the original formula because I gradually started to break out in hormonal chin acne for the remaining year that of which I never had when the manufacture was Watson.
19	59	If anyone has struggled with bad skin, I suggest taking Sprintec as that helped for the acne this pill caused.
19	60	No mood swings, no weight gain, no increased acne, and so light of periods that I only need a liner which lasts for 2 to 4 days.
19	61	I hoped that it would make my cycle more consistent and to help with my acne.
19	62	As for the acne, it's still the same.
19	63	I needed these for my irregular periods and hormonal acne and this did nothing for either of those.
19	64	I will say, the acne was my only downfall with this pill.
19	65	My acne stopped as soon as I quit the pill
19	66	I do like it because it has cleared up some of my acne and I believe that I just got my "period" this week which was very light spotting.
19	67	And my acne got worse, I would normally get pimples around the time of my period, but now I always have 3 or more pimples at a time that would scar.
19	68	Hoping this will help me out some with weight and acne .. Everyone's body is different but I've seen some good reports and some negative reports .
19	69	Not to mention my acne has gotten worse.
19	70	I have a little acne which is bothersome since I have PCOS and was hoping for this pill to get rid of the spots, but so far theres been no improvement.
19	71	I've been on this pill since I was 15 I am 22 now never had a problem unless I miss a few pills, I have never been pregnant, very light blood, no cramps, very little pimples to anyone with bad acne and bad cramps I highly recommend this pill.
19	72	I have slight acne, I never get bad pimples but now my T- zone is bad!
19	73	I have a little acne between my breasts(which NEVER happens).
19	74	Everything is great except for the acne....
19	75	I had terrible acne which I never experienced before.
19	76	The only plus was that I did not gain weight, and I am glad I am finally getting back to normal even if I do have the acne scars.
19	77	About one week in I got acne which I haven't struggled with for several years (I am 23).
19	78	I don't think it has helped with my acne at all, but I did gain some weight (5-7 pounds or so) so far I am happy with it, but my insurance is starting to cover Junel Fe, not sure if I'm going to start taking it or not, after reading some reviews  I'm nervous  about it.
19	79	I've always been prone to the occasional breakout, but this cystic acne is out of control and it has made my skin very sensitive to touch.
19	80	I suppose only time will tell whether my weight and acne will sort itself out.
19	81	As far as the acne , it is crazy I went to the dermatologist and she told me this birth control is prone to acne , but maybe it might go away after a few months.
19	82	I also had a little (barely noticeable) acne, sore boobs, light dizziness, spotting and increased appetite but mind over matter!
19	83	Also, my breasts have gotten a little bigger (next size up), and my acne hasn't changed much, even though it wasn't bad at all before I started this.
19	84	With my previous pill I had no breast tenderness, acne problems, and always got my period like clockwork.
19	85	I started spotting like crazy, I was nauseous and didn't want to do anything,  also it made me a little depressed, and I started getting a little more acne than usual.
19	86	I've been on Microgestin for almost 3 years, and the only side effect I ever had was that it cleared up my acne completely.
19	87	I mainly switched because Lutera was giving me horrible acne and spotting.
19	88	With Microgestin, my acne has been relatively normal except the last couple of months, which could have been induced by stress.
19	89	The first month was hell, I got really depressed and broke out with acne on my face so I wanted to switch.
19	90	I haven't gained any weight only bad mood swings, acne and cravings.
19	91	So far my acne has cleared up.
19	92	I had acne before and now I have literally no pimples.
19	93	In summary, it is a good contraceptive and it cleared up my acne, but it is completely ineffective at regulating my menstrual cycle.
19	94	I was a bit moody at first, but no weight gain, acne did clear up decently.
19	95	I chose to get on it for birth control, to help acne, and to regulate my period.
19	96	But I didn't have any side effects or weight gain or bad acne.
19	97	For the entire time I have been very moody, bloated, retaining water, have had cramps, nausea, acne, breakthrough bleeding, EVERYTHING.
19	98	Then for a couple months, the acne stopped, but other symptoms began popping up: Spotting, sometimes early period, extreme mood swings, weight gain (20lbs).
19	99	Clears acne.
19	100	I switched after 6 months of Lo Loestrin, which caused me to gain 10  pounds, constant spotting, and worse acne.
19	101	Zero weight gain, I've actually lost 7 pounds, and my acne is gone!
19	102	I switched to this pill from Mirena due to severe cystic acne (from the Mirena).
19	103	After my first month on Microgestin Fe, my cystic acne started clearing up.
19	104	But I guess my body never fully adjusted because 6 months later, this pill is giving me headaches, I have breakthrough bleeding in the middle of the month every month, I feel slightly nauseous all throughout the day, and I still cramp and get acne.
19	105	I only get light acne (one or two pimples) when my cycle is about to come on I've had no breakthrough bleeding, but have noticed a decrease in sex drive, but not by too much.
19	106	I never have had acne prone skin..
19	107	I broke out with horrible acne when I had to double up on the pill.
19	108	I started taking this pill for acne because I had terrible terrible acne but now my face is completely cleared up and I barely ever get any zits.
19	109	It worked great for pregnancy prevention, unfortunately it left me quite irritable and my skin has broken out with acne.
19	110	I didn't have acne or cramps before and I still don't get them.
19	111	Months 1-2= no cramping, came right on time, incredibly light, period lasted 1-3 days, no weight gain, no acne
19	112	I don't get my period and my cramps are gone along with my acne.
19	113	My acne stayed the same.
19	114	The good thing about it is that I never broke out with acne and my chest got a little bigger.
19	115	I haven't had bad acne, no weight gain whatsoever (it's extremely hard for me so weight gain is welcomed for me), no crazy mood swings, no nausea.
19	116	My acne cleared up.
19	117	I get less of those really huge balls of acne (the ones where nothing will come out but its the size of 5 pimples).
19	118	I have had an acne problem for about almost 1 year.
19	119	The only good side effect would be I haven't had any acne on my back (it might also be because of the weather now).
19	120	I have developed dark spots on my face which are very embarrassing, as well as acne.
19	121	I have had no weight gain, no mood swings, no acne, and no change in breast size (unfortunately).
19	122	On a good note, it seemed to help with my acne and didn't kill my sex drive.
19	123	Also... my acne is NOT gone!
19	124	I haven't gained any weight and have found that my skin is completely cleared of any acne.
19	125	I started taking birth control at 18 and started off with Yaz to help with my mild back acne.
19	126	My acne is cleared up, my sex drive is still incredible, I have LOST WEIGH and my periods are almost NON EXISTENT!
19	127	I haven't experienced any weight gain, nausea, discomfort, mood swings or acne.
19	128	It helped clear out my cystic acne; but I have gained dramatically 10 lbs within 4 months and that wasn't funny!
19	129	Made my sex drive super low, very bad acne and I was always irritable and emotional.
19	130	No acne improvement or anything like that.
19	131	Slight improvement in acne that wasn't bad to begin with, no change in breast size.
19	132	My acne is only marginally better, my periods have been irregular, I'm moody, weepy at times, and I have NO sex drive.
19	133	Also, my acne started out great, but has gotten worse in the last few months.
19	134	I have noticed some weight gain, but on the plus side, my acne has cleared up.
19	135	So far I've gained 3 pounds every 2 weeks, my face has exploded with acne, my hair seems to be falling out, I get mood swings, I get teary eyed over EVERYTHING, and I get horrible period like cramps.
19	136	I gained 15 lbs, started breaking out with acne like crazy, was weepy about nothing at all or very angry, did not have a period for 6 months and then became pregnant.
19	137	At first I thought it was acne because they were like little red bumps.
19	138	No weight gain, no headaches, no acne, no side effects really except I no longer have a period at all.
19	139	Did not improve acne.
19	140	I have NEVER had any bad side effects from it, no acne, no mood swings.
19	141	Suddenly my face began breaking out and leaving horrible dark marks.
19	142	I tried this birth control for a week and I have been breaking out severely.
19	143	Within the first week my chin started breaking out and after two months it was left covered in pimples and scars.
19	144	Around month six I missed my period three months in a row, wasn't pregnant, thank god, and started breaking out like crazy.
19	145	I put on 20lbs, started breaking out, moods swings and PMDD were in full force.
19	146	However, after being on it for 3 months I had gained 15 pounds, was breaking out on and off, like a prepubescent teenager.
19	147	I have been on my birth control for a month now, I've been eating a lot lately and breaking out.
19	148	I have a painful zit on my left side of my forehead, 2 small pimples on the right side, and 2 small pimples on my left cheek.
19	149	I never get pimples on my cheeks!!!
19	150	These are not normal pimples with heads but huge, painful, and hard ones.
19	151	Ever since I've been on this pill I haven't had any weight gain, my face is clear (every once in a while I'll get pimples on my face & breast) but I think that is because I live a very active lifestyle.
19	152	When I get my period..I get tiny pimples here & there but it's nothing serious.
19	153	I have never had more than 5 pimples on my entire life, and now I get pimples readily.
19	154	Pros with Microgestin Fe: my skin is mostly clear (I rarely get pimples), and my period is usually light and I sometimes barely get anything at all if I've consistently taken the pills and don't miss one/take one late.
19	155	I never had a breakout tho, and my skin is prone to hormonal zits.
19	156	I feel sick everyday and my face has only had a few zits.
19	157	Around month six, I started getting horrible heavy, crampy, clotty breakthrough bleeding with cramps that were up there in terms of the worst I've ever experienced.
19	158	I get my period on the same day every month and with very minimal cramps and bleeding.
19	159	My periods use to be heavy and last 4-5 days with bad cramps.
19	160	Had cramps but not bad.
19	161	My cramps are slight on day one and then gone for the rest of my period.
19	162	It would have been great to get bigger boobs from this but alas, nothing is perfect ;) Try this for sure if you have very heavy periods, very strong cramps and endo in its beginning stages.
19	163	Also, my cycle was very light and hardly any cramps; just back pain.
19	164	When I finally got my period, I was in so much pain that I laid in bed for two whole days and felt nauseous with sharp cramps and couldn't even move to turn in bed.
19	165	My bleeding has reduced some but my cramps are still severe on most periods
19	166	The medicines interacted each other and I bled so heavily and had labor like cramps.
19	167	I also do get cramps on the week I don't take the pills.
19	168	I have a Paraguard is great, it also has some big side effects such as super heavy (HEAVY) bleeding, long periods, and horrible cramps.
19	169	I experienced excruciating cramps and severe headaches.
19	170	I would recommend birth control if you are having such bad cramps because it really helped me.
19	171	Okay I haven't been on this pill very long, but my doctor prescribed it to me for heavy bleeding and intense cramps.
19	172	The last two days have been pure hell with cramps.
19	173	It helped with the length and heaviness of my period and cramps weren't nearly as bad as they had once been.
19	174	Was prescribed this form of birth control for the horrendous period cramps I've struggled with since first starting my periods back when I was 11, always has been a major issue, no solutions were able to be found regardless of all the 'natural' means I had tried.
19	175	Very effective in eliminating cramps and lessening the flow, am not left only to lay in bed in agony, often forget that I'm having my period now.
19	176	No real side effects besides muscle cramps at times and very sore breasts off & on, along with mood swings, but it has been very worth it, wish I had gotten on these pills sooner, quality of life is much better.
19	177	My first month on this pill, I've had the most horrible cramps I've had in my life.
19	178	I finally decided to go off it and just after stopping it I got awful cramps and nausea.
19	179	I used to get very heavy periods with absolute horrible cramps and with the pill I got my period very lightly for only 3 days with no cramps.
19	180	My sex drive was gone, I had major stomach cramps along with constipation, my mood was terrible and I was always angry or sad, I gained a lot of weight due to the fact that my appetite increased majorly, my periods were abnormal and my skin was the worst it has ever been.
19	181	I've always had short periods with bad cramps, took away most cramps but still have pain and soreness.
19	182	Before the birth control my menstrual cramps used to sooooo painful!
19	183	Now I barely have cramps.
19	184	First, they came randomly throughout the year and lasted about 7 days w/ minimal cramps.
19	185	No cramps or nausea and I haven't noticed a weight change.
19	186	I took this pill for birth control and to help my cramps.
19	187	It made my cramps so much better, hardly any at all.
19	188	Spotting and just slight cramps.
19	189	Had semi bad cramps during the inactive week.
19	190	I would also get bloated and bad cramps beginning about the 2 week of the pill pack.
19	191	Although my periods are very light with no cramps, I don't recommend this pill at all.
19	192	I am extremely emotional on it and even have chest cramps.
19	193	I used to throw up because of my bad cramps and now I rarely even get one
19	194	Okay so I was on this pill for about 5 months, I have really horrible period cramps to where I couldn't get out of bed, I've tried 2 other pills before this one and those didn't work so I tried this one and the only positive thing about this pill is no pregnancy scares and light periods and my face stayed clear.
19	195	(My cramps used to be so excruciating that I would have to stay home.)
19	196	Not only did this pill make my period much lighter and manageable cramps, I also have had no pregnancy scares!
19	197	Highly recommend this to any woman struggling with heavy periods companied by horrible cramps or is sexually active.
19	198	I had cramps and a full blown period for 2.5 weeks.
19	199	My periods are light and stay for 4 days at the most, no cramps.
19	200	Sometimes I skip 2-3 months of the period on the pill pack, so when I do decide to go on my period, it's pretty heavy with cramps.
19	201	I started taking this pill at 17 because I had cramps that would literally make me immobile - to the point of missing school.
19	202	I have no cramps, no spotting, and my period is now extremely light, to the point where I forget I have it at times.
19	203	Now after 7 months of taking the pill, my before unbearable cramps are almost nonexistent, my period that used to last a full week only lasts 4 days, and all the side effects I experienced the first month were gone within the second.
19	204	Also heavier bleeding, intense cramps, intense breast tenderness, breakouts on chest and shoulders, no sex drive at all, lethargy.
19	205	With Watson I had mild cramps and hardly ever bled.
19	206	I do notice that I get cramps the week of my period but very minor.
19	207	Went on for AWFUL cramps and have completely stopped them!
19	208	Definitely lessened cramps and flow once a month.
19	209	However, after the one week on it each month I have mild cramps and light flow.
19	210	However, I still have cramps and I have emotional breakdowns the few days before my period comes.
19	211	Before I was on birth control I had extremely terrible cramps as most people in my family do.
19	212	No cramps and my flow is extremely light and easy.
19	213	I do have backaches and cramps periodically throughout my cycle, but they're manageable with a little ibuprofen.
19	214	Gained weight, mood swings, horrible cramps and bleeding in between periods.
19	215	To combat cramps and prevent pregnancy I have been on oral contraceptives for 11 years.
19	216	I had horrible cramps that I used to have to miss school and work because of, and now, they're almost nonexistent!
19	217	I am not horribly incapacitated by my periods (before I would get really sick with bad cramps and nausea and headaches).
19	218	My periods last maybe a day at most, no cramps, no usual symptoms like before.
19	219	My cramps are very tolerable.
19	220	Love the regularity, love that my cramps are gone, love that I can adjust my cycle if I have a special event, love that I have had zero weight gain (have lost weight but that is due to diet/exercise), and love that I still feel like myself on this pill.
19	221	Lighter period and cramps were not as bad and I was not as moody the days before my period.
19	222	I have now been on it a month and a half and been having spotting and cramps for the past three days.
19	223	I had very little cramps.
19	224	It doesn't last as long as a normal period but its enough to give me bad cramps.
19	225	I used Microgestin continuously because my periods give me unbearable cramps.
19	226	One other thing...it didn't seem to help any with cramps but mine were always mild in general so I don't know how much more it could be reduced.
19	227	I only got on the pill because I get serious cramps.
19	228	The pill gives me a lighter period on time every month and no cramps at all.
19	229	Before I got on this pill I was experiencing extreme extreme cramps to the point where I could not sleep through the night without waking up two times each hour from the pain.
19	230	I started this pill and have been on it for about a month now and have not got cramps at all!
19	231	All of my cramps have disappeared!
19	232	The pill also regulated my period, which had been very irregular before, and my cramps became much less painful.
19	233	I used to have severe cramps prior to getting on this birth control to the point I was prescribed muscle relaxants (that bad!)...
19	234	My breasts do get sore, but I have no mood swings and never get cramps.
19	235	And then about a week after taking it the bloating, nausea, and cramps came back.
19	236	I experience slight cramps the first day of my cycle.
19	237	I was put on this primarily for debilitating menstrual cramps and I've been on it for 5 months now, going on my 6th
19	238	This pill gives me little to no nausea (all pills make me feel very sick), I have had no headaches, my periods are shorter, lighter, and I do not experience cramps anymore.
19	239	Now five years later my skin is the clearest it has ever been, I haven't had a legit cramp in probably two years, and my periods only last about 4 days with minimal bleeding.
19	240	My periods are gone and I do not cramp at all.
19	241	The first month was amazing, as far as my period goes, light, short, cramp free, nausea and vomit free!
19	242	The positives: My periods are much lighter, shorter, and I have less cramping.
19	243	My periods come with very heavy cramping.
19	244	I never really had any side effects, no cramping, no break through bleeding.
19	245	I was having heavy bleeding in my periods and severe cramping.
19	246	I feel as if this gives me more breast tenderness and doesn't help with my cramping AS much, but hey, it could just be because our bodies grow and change constantly.
19	247	The pills did nothing to help with the cramping that comes with a period, or with my endometriosis pain.
19	248	I loved it though it was given to me for severe cramping and heavy periods and and never felt sick on it and it lowered my period to 3 days and low periods!
19	249	It was amazing sometimes my period wouldn't even come because I was skipping the brown ones and going straight to a new pack my cramping was gone and if I ever did get it was very mild better than how I used to get them!
19	250	lots of cramping and feeling like pregnant but was not.
19	251	It was my mothers idea and it was supposedly to minimize cramping.
19	252	After being on the med for only 2 months, I began to get unusual headaches,  unusual cramping, and constant spotting.
19	253	And my periods are like clock work and usually pretty light with minimal cramping which is a plus.
19	254	Pros: Lighter periods, some cramping but much less, no pregnancy scares.
19	255	I gained weight with no change in eating/ workouts, and am back to having the extreme cramping and regular periods I had prior to being on the pill.
19	256	I have even started cramping and bleeding midway through with no missed pills.
19	257	With it I experienced a small amount of weight gain, tender breast every month around my cycle, increase in my breast size,  and my monthly periods lasting 2-4 days with minimal cramping.
19	258	Suffered from horrible cramping early in my menstruation (started age 11).
19	259	On this have had two very light periods with typical cramping every month for the past 7(ish) years (Which I didn't mind too much and my doctor said if I don't mind it isn't hurting me).
19	260	I also know that I have one week left of this pack and I've already started my period, as well as the cramping.
19	261	I have mild cramping and nausea/feelings similar to my menses during the bleeding.
19	262	I haven't had cramping or bloating, I haven't gained any weight, I may have actually lost about 5lbs.
19	263	I could not figure out why I have been so miserable (tender breasts, extreme cramping and bloating, weight gain, and depression) but after reading some of these reviews I can relate.
19	264	I've noted breast tenderness, weird cramping, severe mood swings (laughing and crying at the same time while watching commercials; that was odd), my period doesn't occur in the normal cycle time, and I've gained a significant amount of weight.
19	265	and now its slight cramping for a day or two the week of my "period".
19	266	I only have light bleeding/no bleeding and cramping when I do have my periods, which only last 2-4 days.
19	267	I've been on it for about 7 months and I have only had spotting here and there, not my actual period.
19	268	I don't like it as much- my skin isn't as perfect as it was on Lutera, and some months I have spotting for 2 weeks straight- but I have not experienced any weight gain or nausea on this pill.
19	269	But because of the spotting this pill is kind of a pain.
19	270	Also I got spotting mid cycle.
19	271	The two times I accidentally took the pill a few hours late, I immediately started spotting and would continue to spot for a few days.
19	272	I thought it was spotting at first, but then it was heavier and lasted until my actual period started with the sugar pills.
19	273	At first taking it I noticed spotting in between my period for only 2 months but after that my period has gone away completely, which is common for anyone who had light periods prior to Microgestin.
19	274	I only had spotting once while I was on this pill and it lasted for about a day or two and was very light.
19	275	Pros: no pregnancy,very light menstrual cycle, and no spotting.
19	276	My periods are now more like spotting, but lasts the full 7-8 days.
19	277	I take the pill as close to 10pm as possible and I haven't had anymore spotting or nausea.
19	278	Light spotting on and off but my periods/cramps have stopped all together.
19	279	I had some spotting and a few minor breakouts during the second week.
19	280	The only side effect I did notice was random spotting (bleeding).
19	281	Periods are two and a half days and its spotting.
19	282	The first couple weeks I had light spotting and nausea but it has decreased.
19	283	Cons: Low libido, lots of breast tenderness, frequent headaches/migraines, spotting between periods, exhaustion, some weight gain (especially in my breasts, which is not a plus if you're already ~curvy~ to begin with).
19	284	It is never the same and is either light spotting or a random heavy gush.
19	285	One negative side effect is that I have been spotting since day 1 but its manageable and they say this goes away after your body adjusts to the hormones.
19	286	I have noticed my periods are much lighter and I have had no spotting.
19	287	SO I switched to Microgestin and the first month was ok, but then I became an absolute lunatic with all my mood swings, increased appetite, spotting, and HAIR LOSS!
19	288	However, spotting did happen all through the first month until I got my normal period.
19	289	Before going on birth control I never experienced spotting.
19	290	I began spotting on day 2 and by day 5, I was having a period, I decided to wait another week before calling my doctor, and the bleeding was consistent with a "normal" period.
19	291	I also took my packs back to back for 3 months and I wouldn't spot until I was off of it.
19	292	I only spot for a day which is nice since I no longer have to drop more money on period supplies.
19	293	In the beginning I would spot almost everyday (horrible) and get headaches.
19	294	Sometimes I only spot for a day and that's it.
19	295	During my first month on it I spotted almost everyday, but after that I did not have a single issue with this pill.
19	296	The first month I spotted off and on by the second month my bleeding was mostly done.
19	297	I started out on the shot, worked well but I didn't like not having a period and with my emotions I spotted all the time.
19	298	Overall it has been good and does what it needs to do, I have had nearly NO bad side effects: no weight gain, no headaches/nausea, no mood changes, spotted only once, lighter 'period,' etc.
19	299	I stopped last April and haven't had that particular type of headache since!!
19	300	Cons: 1 st month pregnancy symptoms, ongoing: increase appetite,  bigger breast with sore to touch, and headache from time to time.
19	301	My headache also gotten much worse than before.
19	302	I started having horrendous headaches.
19	303	The onset was gradual, so I did not make a correlation between the pill and my headaches.
19	304	I suffered WAY too long before I figured out that my headaches were due to this pill.
19	305	On a scale of 1 to 10, the headaches ranged from 3 to 7.
19	306	They were not debilitating headaches, but they lasted for days at a time.
19	307	My doctor originally prescribed this medication to me because I get headaches frequently.
19	308	I have mild nausea and headaches but other than that no side effects.
19	309	No weight gain, no nausea, no headaches, nothing.
19	310	It's been one week I started microgestin and I'm having chest pain, headaches, feeling nauseous and tired all the time and I can't sleep at nights.
19	311	Anyway, for the first 9 months- a year or so I was experiencing minor headaches from this pill, I did not gain or lose any weight that I was aware of, but I am also a very active person.
19	312	I've gotten a lot of minor headaches, and I'm a little emotional.
19	313	In that time period, I gained 10 pounds, was bloated all the time, and had the worst stomach pains and headaches.
19	314	I am only on week 2 so I myself need to bare with it..I've so far noticed a dramatic appetite increase, irritability and a slight headaches...
19	315	I was only on this pill for 4 days and within those four days I lost my appetite and had mild headaches.
19	316	But the side effects are the worse which is nausea, weight gain, breast larger, tender hurting a lot, mood swings, depression, emotional, change in appetite, nervous, headaches.
19	317	The headaches alone made me quit taking this pill.
19	318	I have been on it 5 months and never in my life have I suffered from such severe and frequent headaches as I have these past 5 months.
19	319	I only took it for a week but it caused horrible headaches that were borderline migraines.
19	320	Oh, & I get horrible headaches now due to this pill.
19	321	I remember being extremely moody, tired, nauseous and got headaches when I first started.
19	322	Still gives me nausea and headaches.
19	323	Sometimes get nausea and headaches, but not consistently.
19	324	It wasn't until the third month that I started getting constant nausea like all day everyday and even worse at night, headaches, sore boobs, frequent urination and absolutely no sex drive.
19	325	No nausua, no headaches.
19	326	I barely ever get a period which is awesome, but i've been noticing the past year or so that my headaches have become almost daily and it's shooting pains above my right eye, my hair has started shedding so bad it's really disgusting and my boobs always feel so sore, even from just wearing a bra.
19	327	At first it was ok, my headaches improved and it helped decrease my milk supply faster.
19	328	But once I got on the second pack I started having frequent headaches and migraines.
19	329	Also my headaches seemed to last longer with this one.
19	330	Mood swings, lack of sex drive, extreme hunger within minutes of taking the pill, headaches, dry mouth & vagina!
19	331	Had slight tension headaches and mild nausea first few days, however increasing my water intake helped dissipate these symptoms.
19	332	The first week I had headaches and nausea and almost quit taking it due to the side effects but my body adjusted.
19	333	Over the past year, I started to get extremely bad headaches during the sugar pill week.
19	334	I took extra strength Tylenol the entire week, twice a day, and it still didn't make my headaches go away.
19	335	I stopped taking the pills for two days and those awful headaches stopped.
19	336	),   NO sex drive, break through bleeding that lasted longer than actual periods (3 days period, & 2 wks break through) & increased headaches.
19	337	I have been taking this pill for almost a week now and I am experiencing very bad headaches, stomach aches, drowsiness, moody, and depression.
19	338	I just started using Reclipsen because I couldn't handle the low libido, breast tenderness, and headaches!
19	339	I was on this pill for a year and the only side effect I had were the occasional bad headaches.
19	340	I got really bad headaches and gained weight, and I was very moody.
19	341	I used to be on Yasmin for 3 years, and would get headaches almost daily.
19	342	Ever since I switched, I rarely get headaches.
19	343	I was on this pill for 3 months and I decided to switch because I kept getting breakthrough bleeding and headaches.
19	344	I also started getting terrible headaches.
19	345	I continued to have terrible headaches and night sweats.
19	346	The only side effect I've had is light headaches every once in a while.
19	347	No bad psychological effects and I get less headaches on this pill than when not on pill or from Yasmin.
19	348	Since I have been on the pill, I feel sick more often, stomach pains, bloating, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, leg pains, vaginal pains, back pains, but its never constant so I usually dismiss it.
19	349	And ever since I have had a lot of rough mornings with nausea and headaches.
19	350	No weight gain and no headaches.
19	351	I have been diagnosed with migraine headaches and my doctor has been working with me on finding a birth control whose side effects don't outweigh the good.
19	352	With everything else I have had immense headaches and nausea but with this one so far so good.
19	353	But this pill did give me regular period, no headaches, no aches.
19	354	Plus I don't get the horrible headaches anymore!
19	355	Unfortunately, I get headaches like crazy.
19	356	Not sure if I want to continue this pill because the headaches are really interrupting my life style.
19	357	I didn't think too much of it until the fourth day when I had the worst migraine (the ones you feel in your eyes) of my life along with nausea to the point where I would get out of bed and start gagging.
19	358	I've always been a migraine sufferer but there were more days with migraines than there were without.
19	359	Yasmin gave me migraine 4-7 days a week which was awful!
19	360	It started giving me horrible migraines that made me unable to function.
19	361	I've also gained weight, experienced the migraines and nausea others have mentioned, now have lighter periods, and get frequent bacterial vaginosis.
19	362	I went on this medication to help with migraines and admittedly have had fewer but the other side effects aren't worth it.
19	363	I also suffer with migraines so my doctor put me on topomax 50 mg to help prevent them.
19	364	I did get some migraines and sore chest but I got those when I wasn't on the pill as well.
19	365	It also caused me to get frequent migraines.
19	366	I've been on MANY different bc pills because I suffer from migraines, which worsen with estrogen.
19	367	Also, I didn't get migraines with these pills like I did with some other birth control pills.
19	368	I got migraines and had major mood swings.
19	369	I have major migraines, I am depressed, already had anxiety but it has heightened, I am moody and nauseous all the time.
19	370	No migraines.
19	371	This pill gave me migraines, made me anxious, panic attacks, (I have lost so many jobs just because I cry in the middle of a work day), the worst, longest depression I have ever had.
19	372	A month has passed and I have bad migraines that last from morning til night.
19	373	I did enjoy the light periods and they were short..but I'm considering changing to a different pill because the migraines are terrible for me.
19	374	I started getting weekly migraines that literally made me bedridden.
19	375	Out of nowhere, I realized I would find myself crying over absolutely nothing, have these awful mood swings, and had ZERO sex drive.
19	376	I've been on Apri for a week and I feel 100x better than I did on Microgestin and I have a sex drive back!
19	377	My sex drive was normal, my moods were normal, then it all changed.
19	378	Not to mention my sex drive became nonexistent, and I was so dry down there it was too painful to enjoy intercourse.
19	379	I also noticed that it nearly completely killed my sex drive and put me in a generally depressive state.
19	380	My anxiety levels are through the roof and I have such a loss in sex drive.
19	381	Yes everyone's body is different but while taking the Microgestrin pill I had a lighter period which was a plus but I also felt really nausea at times, tender boobs, bloating, weight gain, and a very low sex drive which was the main reason I stopped taking it.
19	382	My sex drive is through the roof.
19	383	I've also noticed a lot of people said it decreased their sex drive.
19	384	For me, it has increased my sex drive, but I don't self-lubricate, so it kinda sucks.
19	385	Other side effects: anxiety, panic attacks, mood swings, weird, vivid, and often sexual dreams, I sleep so much (10 hrs/night), loss of sex drive.
19	386	The only difference that I experienced was my sex drive, it seemed to have decreased a bit but nothing major.
19	387	As well, the low sex drive is crazy.
19	388	I also have had decreased sex drive and it is causing strain in my relationship...
19	389	This pill honestly has not affected my sex drive at all - so in my opinion to each its own.
19	390	My moods are horrible and my sex drive is low.
19	391	I also have zero sex drive, which is annoying as hell.
19	392	I have also had muslce aches, low sex drive, hot flashes, major change of appetite, emotional breakdowns, minor anxiety attacks, and so on.
19	393	Hair loss and low sex drive were also something I noticed.
19	394	I also experience a decrease in sex drive, fatigue, and increase in vaginal discharge.
19	395	The con of this pill is low sex drive.
19	396	My sex drive is the same as it was before the pill and I haven't had a single pregnancy scare which is great because I've had unprotected sex with my boyfriend the entire time I've been on the pill.
19	397	The cons for me are: lack of sex drive and tender breasts.
19	398	I have experienced breast tenderness, bloating, water retention (this is where the weight gain comes from), and a little bit of lack of sex drive.
19	399	The cons were the lack of sex drive.
19	400	My sex drive greatly diminished, which was very frustrating for me and my fianc
19	401	No weight gain happened, and my sex drive stayed the same.
19	402	My skin is clear , my sex drive is the same.
19	403	My reaction to this pill is odd....sometimes it gives me an insane intiatiable sex drive, and sometimes I have no drive at all.
19	404	I haven't gained any weight except in my butt and I went from a B to a C. I haven't had any emotional or sex drive changes but there is are two major downsides to the medication.
19	405	But as far as negative effects I was severely depressed all the time, and suffering from Anxiety attacks daily and  secondary to the anxiety I would be constantly nauseous & worst of all I had no sex drive, just the thought of sex Disgusted me.
19	406	Sex drive remained the same.
19	407	Terrible mood swings, no sex drive at all.
19	408	On the plus side, my sex drive is great and my mood hasn't changed much.
19	409	My sex drive has increased which is a plus, and my periods last about 4 days.
19	410	Getting it inserted was the most painful thing I've ever experienced and for 3 days after I literally had "labor pains" I stayed with it for 6 months and completely lost my sex drive and when I got it removed I had my period for 3 weeks.
19	411	After switching from levora* to which I had the worst experience for 3 months, gained 14 lbs* my doctor decided to prescribe microgestin, I'm in my 2nd pack and so far I've had The only thing good about this pill is my high sex drive and that's it
19	412	My sex drive was incredible!
19	413	The only thing I have noticed is mood swings, and increased sex drive.
19	414	High sex drive, all the time.
19	415	Sex drive is definitely higher (and more enjoyable).
19	416	The boyfriend loves the noticeably larger breasts and increased sex drive.
19	417	My sex drive is a lot higher than normal.
19	418	My sex drive is at its peak, so no negative effects in that department.
19	419	After the first week I became severely depressed with heavy mood swings and no sex drive at all.
19	420	Haven't noticed any difference in sex drive.
19	421	During the first month or so, my sex drive decreased a bit and I was nauseated in the morning sometimes.
19	422	As it has in the past, my skin has completely cleared up, however this time around I am feeling extremely nauseaus, lost my sex drive, and I am constantly and randomly just bursting into tears.
19	423	It slowed my sex drive down in the first few months of use, but my drive is back to normal now.
19	424	The side effects I have had loss of sex drive, moodiness, weight gain and an irregular menstrual cycle.
19	425	They only thing this had done for is heighten my sex drive.
19	426	No major side effects, except very low sex drive.
19	427	NO sex drive.
19	428	My periods have resumed but I've got no sex drive, rly bad skin and have become emotionally unstable around my time of the month which is very unusual for me.
19	429	However, no sex drive and very "dry" since I've started taking this.
19	430	zero sex drive.
19	431	I have also experienced a huge increase in sex drive which is unusual.
19	432	I get depressed and moody easily and I have completely lost my sex drive.
19	433	The biggest downfall is the fact I am depressed a lot and have zero sex drive.
19	434	I blame the birth control because I have gone without it for a few days because I ran out and I felt like a new happy woman with a sex drive.
19	435	The first week was fine, my sex drive was normal and did not feel depressed.
19	436	I also had no sex drive at all.
19	437	I lost 15-20 lbs, moods have been more stable and my sex drive has increased dramatically!
19	438	I also had a low sex drive.
19	439	I've noticed a very high increase in my sex drive, and I've had a couple mood swings of being very emotional, but your body needs time to adjust to all the hormones!
19	440	My breasts are so sore its ridiculous and I'm very nauseous, but the reason I started this birth control was because I had a very high sex drive and I wanted a birth control that would calm it down.
19	441	No decrease in sex drive and increase in breast size - I went from an A to B cup!
19	442	No noticeable effect on sex drive, my boyfriend is happy.
19	443	BUT I have NO SEX DRIVE at all.
19	444	When I first started the pill probably around month 6 I did experience a decreased sex drive but it returned within about a month or two.
19	445	I also have not lost my sex drive AT ALL.
19	446	For the most part my experience has been very positive: I have not experienced unusual mood swings, weight gain or changes in sex drive.
19	447	I do have a low sex drive, I'm always dry, I did go up one cup size.
19	448	However, I have pretty much no sex drive whatsoever and am very dry.
19	449	I don't have mood swings anymore, don't break out, my sex drive actually increased, my libido is sky high, my boyfriend can't even keep up.
19	450	Sex drive decreased the first 2 months but is normal now.
19	451	The glaring exception to this is a drop in sex drive that was low to begin with, which kind of negates why I chose this form of birth control in the first place.
19	452	I literally have lost all signs of a sex drive.
19	453	I have NO sex drive and I am moody.
19	454	I have completely lost my sex drive and motivation for anything.
19	455	You would think I was pregnant, no sex drive and my husband is fed up with it!
19	456	My sex drive is the same and hasn't changed at all.
19	457	No pregnancies because I lost my sex drive and became dry.
19	458	The down side is my libido has decreased recently (only after being on the pill for many years); I'll be switching pills temporarily to see if there is a difference.
19	459	I haven't had any mood swings, no problems with libido, my emotions feel more balanced and I don't have PMS.
19	460	No changes to libido or any other side effects.
19	461	And the WORST part it made me go from someone with an extremely high libido to someone that cringed at sex.
19	462	However, my libido hasn't been the same in years since I've been on birth control, so I'm considering the IUD
19	463	The last two months, when my libido began to suffer, I decided to switch.
19	464	About 3 months in my libido decreased but I wasn't having any other side effects so I decided to wait it out and see if things got better.
19	465	My libido didn't really change.
19	466	My libido was lowered slightly bit considering on the LoEstrin I was a little oversexual, the lowered drive was a relief.
19	467	No weight gain, no breakouts, no nausea, no babies.
19	468	if you are sensitive to weight gain or pills don't take this pill.
19	469	I have experienced no weight gain.
19	470	The only thing that I do not like is the weight gain it makes me eat way more than I do I feel like I'm pregnant.
19	471	I don't mine the bigger boobs but the weight gain sucks.
19	472	3 months and I've had 12 lbs of weight gain, and feel bloated ALL the time.
19	473	Acne for the first month and then it cleared after that, but weight gain continued.
19	474	During the time, I think I actually was depressed from the weight gain and pain.
19	475	I did have some very mild weight gain & anxiety throughout the time I was taking the pill but I don't attribute it Microgestin.
19	476	This birth control has caused me to have in insatiable appetite, This has also caused me weight gain of about 8 pounds and I have a pretty active lifestyle.
19	477	After significant weight gain on depo and the Implant I told my doctor how I'm sensitive to hormones more specifically  progesterone.
19	478	On my small frame, the weight gain is significant!!
19	479	I actually stopped having my period altogether while taking this and didn't experience any weight gain.
19	480	The worst side effect I have had is the weight gain.
19	481	I have been the same weight for years and within the past year, I noticed a lot of weight gain even with being conscious of what I eat.
19	482	I am thinking about trying something else due to the weight gain.
19	483	I took this pill for about 3 years with little side effects (some weight gain).
19	484	I haven't experienced any weight gain though I think.
19	485	I thought I had a bad experience with seasonique solely because of the weight gain but microgestin fe was 100x worst.
19	486	If you can control your diet and exercise the weight gain won't occur or would be more manageable.
19	487	However the weight gain, constant yeast infections every couple months, & cravings like a crazy pregnant woman was insane.
19	488	So I stopped skipping the placebo pills & talking the pack strickly as directed purposely watching was I was eating, & stepping my time up in the gym & was still seeing the weight gain & cravings.
19	489	Not any weight gain or loss and no mood swings.
19	490	BUT mood swings were definitely noticed, and a small weight gain (10lbs or less).
19	491	I had some symptoms while my body was "adjusting" to the hormones: breakthrough bleeding, a little weight gain, feeling blue.
19	492	Within the past nine months I've used it I had lighter periods, didn't break out as much, and I didn't feel any weight gain.
19	493	My periods are predictable and very light, and have had no weight gain.
19	494	No pregnancy scared and no weight gain tho!
19	495	I haven't had any weight gain or breast enlargements.
19	496	No weight gain but sore breasts constantly, lack of periods, nausea, shortness of breath.
19	497	No weight gain and I haven't got my period.
19	498	I haven't noticed much weight gain but the depression is enough to make me call my gyno and switch back to Junel.
19	499	I have had no weight gain, mood swings and my skin is really clear from it.
19	500	I also never experienced any moodiness, bloating, fatigue or weight gain while I was on the pill.
19	501	I have no bad experiences with it at all, no weight gain or anything and it does its job!
19	502	Other than that, I have experienced no mood swings, no weight gain, no unpleasant symptoms.
19	503	No other weight gain.
19	504	Considering I am a very active person, I own a horse and I compete in hunter jumpers and ride 5-6 days a week, I figured the weight gain would be temporary.
19	505	But the pill has led to a recurring yeast infection, dryness, weight gain, and now six months later I've acquired a second period and terrible nausea I'm really considering just stopping this pill now.
19	506	When on Microgestin Fe 1/20 I experienced relatively no side effects besides a few pounds of weight gain and my breasts grew about 2-3 cup sizes.
19	507	No weight gain (other then the breasts one cup size, my mood is calm and I only cry once a month if even (compared to everyday), and I'm not depressed or anxious anymore and sleep is better.
19	508	I was taking another drug around the same time that could very well be the cause of the weight gain, but I've been off of it for over a year and still have not been able to lose the weight.
19	509	I experienced weight gain and excessive night sweats.
19	510	I'm completely frustrated with the weight gain.
19	511	All in all, I say it's not bad-  I have been on SEVERAL types of pills, this is the best so far (minus the weight gain of course...but if I were to get pregnant, I would gain a lot more weight!)
19	512	I have been on this birth control pill for 3 months now and have seen a change in my body as far as weight gain, night sweats and light periods to no period at all.
19	513	I have noticed weight gain and serious bloating.
19	514	I went on this pill to save some $$ but I plan on going back on YAZ - my mood was better, periods were light, no weight gain, skin was better.
19	515	I have had no really awful side effects... no weight gain, no bloating, bad eye sight etc... but one thing I did notice right when I switched from Desogen is that the skin on my face, especially around my eyes, began to develop some red splotches.
19	516	But the best part, NO WEIGHT GAIN.
19	517	I gained 12 lbs, at lest 5 from bloating, 5 from feeling hungry all the time.
19	518	I gained a lot of weight, I'm constantly negative, moody, and my emotions are all over the place.
19	519	Also, I've been eating so much more the past two weeks and I'm so scared to weigh myself because I know I've gained weight (also because of the pill).
19	520	I have gained weight and my face neck and back have cleared up and have been clear.
19	521	I gained weight and also developed anxiety.
19	522	I gained a little bit of weight but not a huge amount.
19	523	I have been on for almost a month now and not only am I not pregnant but I went from a 34C to a D cup (yeaah boi) but I also have gained like 7-8 pounds, but that could be from the hearty eating.
19	524	Within the first month and a half I gained 12 pounds which has never been a problem before on any other b.c.
19	525	My boobs are massive, I've gained weight for no reason, I stopped getting my period all together.
19	526	Ever since , I've gained 15-20 pounds.
19	527	I've gained about 15-20 pounds.
19	528	I could literally starve myself & can't lose the weight I've gained from this pill.
19	529	I gained over 10 pounds within the last month I will never ever again use this birth control
19	530	However, after starting this birth control I have gained about 7-10 pounds and gone up a couple clothes sizes.
19	531	My periods are naturally really light but on the pill they are almost unnoticeable.I havent gained weight or anything and im not experiencing any negative side effects.
19	532	I gained 5-10 lbs and felt "headachy" at times.
19	533	I've gained a solid five pounds since I've been on the pills that I'm having a lot of trouble shaking.
19	534	I decided to give this a try but in the first month I gained 10 lbs, my apetite increased so much.
19	535	I also gained weight around my waistline, despite I'm a very very active gal going to the gym 3-4x a week plus super healthy diet.
19	536	The only downfall is that I gained about 15 pounds on the pill in one year.
19	537	Well ive been on this pill for 3 months now and just realized I gained a whooping 20lbs in those 3 months!!
19	538	I've lost a few pounds, but have gained chubby cheeks  in turn making people think I've gained weight.
19	539	I have gained a solid 8 pounds from this pill ( I believe it is mostly water retention and maybe some fat).
19	540	I gained about 5 lbs, but I'm not sure that was the pill because I started it on my honeymoon and was eating a ton.
19	541	I exercise daily, eat reasonably, and I have not gained weight.
19	542	I have being taking this pill for over 6 months now and I gained like 7 lbs which make me cry every day because I workout a lot and everything I eat is healthy.
19	543	This is my 3rd month on the pill I have not gained weight or had any serious side effects.
19	544	It also gained a little weight but not very much and it went away after I was on it a few months, but my breasts have remained larger.
19	545	I gained like 15 pounds and been so depressed.
19	546	I gained about 10-12 lbs and couldn't lose it which is weird since I eat very raw and workout hard 4-5 times aweek.
19	547	I gained 1lb this week - which isn't much I know, but considering I'm on a concentrated diet and exercise program and have been steadily losing 1-2 lbs a week for 3 months....
19	548	I've been on it for about 3 months now and I've gained about 10 lbs.
19	549	I have gained about 4Ibs so far and my breast have went up a cup size but that is a plus for me.
19	550	I have not gained any weight.
19	551	Between the two pills, I have maintained 60 lbs of weight loss postpartum for nearly two years that I had gained while on Depo Provera and during pregnancy.
19	552	I'm amazed at the weight I lost and didn't realize I gained it from my old birth control..
19	553	I also gained about 10 pounds during the time I was on it.
19	554	This was the first pill that I've been on, within the first month I experienced terrible mood swings, and gained 10 pounds within the first three months.
19	555	After being on Microgestin Fe 1/20 for only a few days I noticed I had gained 2-3 pounds.
19	556	I gained 10 pounds in the first month of taking Microgestin!
19	557	I was getting the Depo shot before and was on that for 9 months, I had gained 40 pounds from it and wanted to switch fast!
19	558	I haven't gained any weight with this which is great, but on the other hand my breast, especially my nipples are super tender most of the time, and they are also getting bigger which isn't that great since I'm a D cup already.
19	559	I haven't gained any weight.
19	560	I started researching this pill because I have gained a lot of weight which I can't seem to lose.
19	561	So far I'm not pregnant, so it's been effective in that avenue, but I've gained 15 lbs, my breasts are tender and sensitive most of the time and they've increased in size from a C cup to DD.
19	562	However, at this point I have gained 15 pounds since I started it.
19	563	After taking Microgestin FE 1/20 I gained back 10lbs in the first month.
19	564	I eat healthy and live an active lifestyle and don't ever workout and I haven't gained any weight.
19	565	And the worst part is that I've weighed the same thing for the past 10 years, and after being on this for 2 months I gained 10 pounds and after 2 and a half months of not being on any birth control I still have it.
19	566	Spotting, night time nausea, some bloating, breast tenderness, I felt tired, more anxiety than usual and just blah.
19	567	Lately I've experienced nausea normally at night.
19	568	The only side effects I've really had are nausea, terrible skin, and BIG BOOBS.
19	569	The nausea only comes in waves which isn't that bad and my skin cleared some after the first two weeks.
19	570	When I first started the only negative side effect I had was nausea 24/7 for about 6 months but it eventually went away.
19	571	I've been on this pill for about 4 months now and for the first three months I experienced a lot of nausea.
19	572	I do recommend this pill because I have not had any other side effects besides for the nausea.
19	573	Don't really have a complaint except night nausea.
19	574	Anyone have ideas about what to do to help with the nausea?
19	575	The first month taking it I had mood swings and nausea, but this is normal!
19	576	I feel negative constantly and so unbelievably tired, the worst part of all is the nausea.
19	577	I did not gain any weight and have lost my appetite due to the nausea.
19	578	I have to take anti nausea medicine daily.
19	579	It started with severe constipation, frequent urination, loss of appetite all together, nausea ALL DAY EVERY DAY mostly at night.
19	580	I truly can't take it anymore and I decided to stop this Bc last night in hopes of the nausea stopping.
19	581	Cons- nausea after placebo week, dark inner thighs, mild depression, and random head aches.
19	582	The first month I had really bad nausea, but then it just went away.
19	583	I did, although, experience nausea every day.
19	584	I recommend to try it for few months because when I first began the pill I had nausea but it stopped after few months
19	585	I also experienced nausea and tummy aching if I took this pill without food.
19	586	However,  I experience constant nausea during the first active week of every pack and during the placebo pills I'm not sure why but it really sucks especially having it all day everyday.
19	587	I was very worried about nausea but if you take it with food you won't have any problems.
19	588	No nausea symptoms, because I always take birth control pills with food.
19	589	When I first began the pill, I had pretty bad nausea and was extremely emotional for the first month.
19	590	Little to no nausea after the first week.
19	591	The only persistent issue that really annoyed me was nausea for the first two days of every new pack.
19	592	I have not noticed any extreme bloating, and I've experienced little to no nausea.
19	593	I've only been on it for 2 weeks and the nausea is killing me.It didn't start until week 2 though.
19	594	To be honest the first month I used this medication it was rough, I fell into a severe depression and started to break out and experienced nausea consistently.
19	595	I take it at 8am every morning and I get bouts of nausea all day.
19	596	I'm gonna stick with this for a while longer and see if the nausea has calmed down or gone away.
19	597	I'm 32 years old & took the pill for about two years, It regulated my periods like clock work to the point I could plan vacations around it, no nausea & skin was clear.
19	598	I had nausea on and off for the first week and a half or so, sometimes lasting all day.
19	599	Add in intermittent nausea the next day.
19	600	No nausea.
19	601	The first few weeks of taking it I had horrible nausea but after that it worked great.
19	602	First few days some nausea.
19	603	Weird right, I like this pill if the nausea would go away and my breasts would stop being so tender!
19	604	My skin was perfect and no nausea, depression, or painful periods.
19	605	I am starting to experience some dizziness and nausea, but the # 1 side effect for me is definitely an increase in appetite.
19	606	In the first three months I had daily morning-sickness-like nausea, but this has tapered off, and happens only on the first day or so of my pill cycle.
19	607	I take this pill every night at 10 so I don't experience nausea as I'm asleep.
19	608	I do take mine at night so I don't get nauseated at all!
19	609	I am nauseous all the time and am having a really hard time doing normal things like working out.
19	610	I've been nauseous all the time and I hate even the thought of eating food.
19	611	My appetite has decreased drastically and whenever I see food I get nauseous.
19	612	I take the pill at 9pm every night and about an hour later I get a little bit nauseous but it's not that bad.
19	613	When I graduated high school 4 years later I tried another pill- made me gain weight, Nuva ring made me nauseous every single day for 3 months, then another pill.
19	614	It made me nauseous for the 3 months total, moody (like incredibly), bloated, veiny around the nipples, tender breast, really really sensitive nipples (if I was wearing a bra and a shirt and I slightly rubbed something against them, it would hurt), felt depressed, fatigue, and it even looked like I was like 3 months pregnant!
19	615	I read a lot of reviews so was so scared cuz it seem like a bad pill but honestly I love it so much the only side effect I have is dizziness & nauseous but they are minimum after that I feel good.
19	616	But I am nauseous all the time.
19	617	No other side effects however recently I have been getting very nauseous  either a few hours later or the next morning even if i take pill with food.
19	618	The first pill I took I did get very nauseous but nothing water and a nap couldn't fix.
19	619	I felt nauseous almost every day.
19	620	I also would feel very lightheaded and nauseous.
19	621	The first couple days I was nauseous, but that went away.
19	622	Felt nauseous about 6 hours after taking the pill, which made me very weak and sick feeling.
19	623	The first week I felt nauseous and had no appetite, but that subsided.
19	624	It would make me extremely nauseous for the whole day and would give me some serious mood swings.
19	625	I do sometimes feel nauseous but it has never been anything too severe.
19	626	I started this pill about two years ago because the previous one I was on made me extremely nauseous.
19	627	My periods also made me pass out and throw up I could work out with my sport teams or run while I was on it I would get dizzy and a lot of the time pass out  or have to leave school because of barely being able to stand at school.
19	628	I was naseous and dizzy constantly and I would be very warm and hot.
19	629	I'm having a better experience than I did when I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen, which made me dizzy and sick.
19	630	No vaginal bleeding as of yet, no dizziness or hairlose, nothing else.
19	631	But the one that I haven't gotten used to which happens to be the worst one for me and that is dizziness.
19	632	I'm currently on a mood swing so forgive me.
19	633	This pill makes me tired and gave me the worst mood swing.
19	634	But for about the last year my mood swings have been terrible and I’ve developed anxiety.
19	635	I didn't have any mood swings or depression.
19	636	When I first started it, I had break through bleeding, extremely sore breasts and mood swings.
19	637	Now that I'm back on this pill my skin is clearing up again and I don't have mood swings or feel down anymore.
19	638	My mood swings are crazy and my food cravings are nuts.
19	639	I got off of it due to how bad my mood swings were.
19	640	On Loloestrin I Lost weight, no mood swings and no periods.
19	641	I've been taking this birth control for about a year now and I actually went on it because of my awful mood swings.
19	642	I think it has helped with evening out my hormones and controlling my mood swings although I still have days where I am awfully moody.
19	643	I do recall some mood swings early on, but I believe this was from switching birth controls and not a symptom of this particular birth control.
19	644	The first two weeks it caused me to have insane mood swings.
19	645	I feel more tired than usual & the mood swings are terrible.
19	646	Additionally, I noticed dramatic mood swings and depression.
19	647	Mood swings,I would get really sad out of no where pretty depressing.
19	648	Prevented pregnancy; however, caused me to gain 15 lbs, break out badly on my face, have mood swings weekly, and be dry as a bone during sex
19	649	By the second month I started having severe mood swings to the point me and my BF considered counseling.
19	650	I've been on this for two weeks and right off the bat I've have trouble sleeping, severe SEVERE mood swings.
19	651	When I first started taking this pill, I had irregular periods and some slight mood swings for the first couple months.
19	652	My only complaint with this pill is that I started getting yeast infections (which I've never had problems with prior to this medication) and my mood swings are worse than usual
19	653	your period gives you mood swings being a girl you get mood swings !!!
19	654	I didn't notice any more mood swings than a normal teen would.
19	655	No mood swings, dryness, etc.
19	656	Unhappy with this birth control been on it for 2 weeks continuous bleeding and mood swings.
19	657	Most birth controls make me have crazy mood swings and gain weight.
19	658	Also I have insane sugar cravings and really bad mood swings.
19	659	My body had a very hard time adjusting to the pill and I had insane mood swings.
19	660	I was afraid at first of starting because of all the reviews I've read online about the mood swings and such but I haven't experienced any.
19	661	I did notice some mood swings, too.
19	662	I'm fed up with these strange mood swings.
19	663	Usually I'm a very rational person,  but after taking them I have extreme mood swings, and minor disagreements turn into week-long fights.
19	664	While on a different pill, I was having problems with suicidal thoughts and depression along with massive mood swings and breast tenderness.
19	665	Mood swings (crying over commercials!
19	666	On the other hand, despite the break out bleeding and the mood swings I get from time to time, I love Microgestin!
19	667	I have lost five pounds, no mood swings and I'm loving it.
19	668	The first few Weeks I had pretty bad mood swings, but I feel my mood has improved.
19	669	Not only that, but I'm ALWAYS tired and have mood swings.
19	670	I notice more hair falling out, horrible mood swings, sore boobs, increased appetite, water retention, ahhhh!
19	671	My breasts were very tender for the first two months and mood swings were horrible.
19	672	My doctor switched me from Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo because of my horrible mood swings with that.
19	673	This pill, while it does help with the mood swings, seems to make me more apathetic towards everything.
19	674	I had horrible mood swings but they are settling down now.
19	675	I had mood swings before I got on any birth control usually right before my period and that is kind of the regular for me even with this pill.
19	676	I have also noticed I have no more mood swings and barely have a period.
19	677	Really light period, larger breasts, less mood swings.
19	678	I have mood swings very very badly.
19	679	I have also experienced severe mood swings, but I cannot discredit it regarding actual birth control.
19	680	Less than a month of taking the pill I have had serious mood swings (lashing in anger, extreme depression) and bad bleeding.
19	681	I had mood swings and I was emotional the whole time I was on it.
19	682	And I had mood swings that were insane.
19	683	I have had breakthrough bleeding (which was expected so not such an issue) but extreme mood changes within just a few weeks.
19	684	I was EXTREMELY nervous about taking this bc.
19	685	Needless to say, I was extremely nervous for starting the pill and was putting it off as long as possible until I couldn't deal with my AWFUL, EXCRUCIATING period pain anymore.
19	686	It's only been 7 days on this pill but I'm impatiently nervous about it.
19	687	Reading some reviews from other sites had me so nervous!
19	688	No period yet, which made me nervous until reading some these reviews.
19	689	After reading so many horrible reviews, I was very nervous and scared about taking this pill, but now going on my third month of taking Microgestin Fe 1/20 I can only say how much I LOVE IT!
19	690	Before starting birth control (about six months ago) I was really scared and nervous, I must report however, that I have seen no negative side effects and I would definitely recommend this pill.
19	691	Shortly after these problems occurred I started to become very anxious.
19	692	I have never been anxious before but on this medication I have had severe anxiety and panic attacks which I never had before.
19	693	I got extremely extremely bad anxiety.
19	694	I have been in a constant state of anxiety for the past five months.
19	695	I do feel like it increased my anxiety a tad bit.
19	696	I have never had anxiety in the past so I tracked when exactly I was having it and when it was at it's highest.
19	697	After two months of tracking it, I noticed on the same exact day of those months I had the highest anxiety at the same exact time.
19	698	I'm also on anti depressants for anxiety and it didn't do anything to make my anxiety worse.
19	699	I loved this pill at the beginning, highly recommend it for young adults that are going through late teen puberty , it was great to start off on as a BC but after three  going on 3 1/2  years I began to notice my anxiety levels shot through the roof at the week before my period.
19	700	Triggered months long depression and anxiety.
19	701	I know everyone reacts differently to different pills, but I would warn someone with a genetic predisposition to depression and anxiety to be VERY careful going on this pill.
19	702	I've never had issues with anxiety and or panic attacks up until I've started taking this pill.
19	703	I have extremely, extremely, extremely bad anxiety.
19	704	At first when starting this medication I noticed a little bit of anxiety after the first 3 weeks but decided to let my body adjust to the hormones and see what happens.
19	705	The worst is the anxiety.
19	706	Decreased my appetite and anxiety.
19	707	i looked more into the side effects and one of the rare side effects is anxiety and knowing this made my week at school a living hell.
19	708	I kept on having very bad anxiety attacks I feel like I'm gonna die, I can't go outside and actually have a good time and I can't breathe while at school Microgestin and Naproxin have side effects causing anxiety.
19	709	oh and I'm going to the doctor on wednesday to talk about my leg and for my anxiety attacks.
19	710	I'm going to give you the total rundown of this pill because I couldn't find one single descriptive review and my anxiety was through the roof when I first started.
19	711	Terrible anxiety, panic attacks ( have never had one before)
19	712	I just read most of the reviews and half of them to me are ridiculous, anxiety, and depression??
19	713	On my second month, I became depressed and began to have anxiety attacks for just about everything.
19	714	I am 21 years old, I was first put on microgestion at the age of 15, my freshmen year of high school because my anxiety was so bad.
19	715	I was having a bad mood or anxiety attack.
19	716	I have used this for four months and only experienced slight breast tenderness in the beginning.
19	717	The first couple of weeks I felt a little bloated, had some heart burn, and breast tenderness but these symptoms were not by any means terrible and 100% went away.
19	718	Eventually after a couple months, my body adjusted and the breast tenderness subsided pretty much and I no longer had irregular bleeding.
19	719	I also had the breast tenderness and sugar cravings like crazy.
19	720	Among the other issues I experienced on Microgestin was chest pain, body soreness, breast tenderness and moodiness.
19	721	I've  been on this birth control for almost 5  months now and initially the only side effect I experienced was extremely sore and tender breasts.
19	722	Not to mention it caused me to get a yeast infection which I never had before and haven't had since I got off the pill.
19	723	Had my first ever yeast infection after being on it for 2 weeks, none since.I'll give this a few more months before I look into switching, since I may still just adjusting to it.
19	724	The second month I got an yeast infection which I had never had before and started getting terrible night sweats to the point I would wake up freezing and would have to change my clothes in the middle of the night.
19	725	Also, since the estrogen levels are high, I have experienced more yeast infections.
19	726	I've always had chronic yeast infections based around my cycle and now I don't have that issue since ovulation isn't a problem anymore.
19	727	I was switched from Yasmin, to Tri-Sprintec, to Microgestin FE 1/20 because of yeast infections.
19	728	This pill has lessened the yeast infections, but sometimes I have reoccurences.
19	729	I've also experienced vaginitis, which I've never had problems with before.
20	1	Before minastrin my periods were extremely irregular, fairly heavy, and accompanied by cramps strong enough to cause vomiting, acne, breast tenderness, and headaches.
20	2	I gained weight, had acne, and became unbelievably moody.
20	3	I suddenly had terrible acne which lasted for the first 6 months and it eventually cleared up again.
20	4	I have been on this birth contraceptive for five months,  some may say you should wait several months to fully review but I am currently dealing with cystic acne,  that of which I have never ever had before and funny thing is I'm also on an acne medication and it still won't fix anything (been on it for three and a half months).
20	5	I'm gonna get off of it as soon as possible but whenever I take the placebo pills is when I get insane acne, gonna have to make sure I use a very strong acne medication when I do get off of it since my hormones are so out of balance
20	6	My endocrinologist wanted to try this as a way to see if my hair loss, acne, and a few other issues were related to something that this medication would help.
20	7	I have never experienced such awful acne as when I was on this pill.
20	8	I have very bad acne but since on this birth control little to no breakouts at all.
20	9	However I started noticing acne breakout and I was surprised at how I waa easy to cry...however I thought it was due to wedding planning and not birth control.
20	10	My acne has cleared, my swolleness has gone down and physically I am feeling better each day.
20	11	The reason I switched was because ortho was making my acne increase and started making my periods very very painful.
20	12	I have been on this pill for about 2 years now, and have not experienced any acne, weight gain, or nausea like other people have.
20	13	This medication has helped decrease my cramps, acne, and mood swings.
20	14	No acne.
20	15	But when it comes to cons the list is huge- I've stayed a steady weight my whole life after taking this pill my weight has sky rocketed, sever bipolar mood swings, acne all the time, and anxiety all the time.
20	16	This medication caused pains in my stomach, severe shoulder and back acne, bloating and cramps.
20	17	I developed the worst acne I have ever had and it is painful.
20	18	I had no nausea, less cramping and bleeding and cleared my acne up.
20	19	I definitely see myself being moodier since taking this pill but no aniexty or depression or acne.
20	20	Hit or miss correlation with my cystic acne and my diet..... period is only 2 days IF I even have one.
20	21	I had bad acne, weight gain, not able to lose weight and stomach pain.
20	22	I only had that in for a month and it caused weight gain 4lbs, water retention, migraines and acne on my neck.
20	23	No acne, no weight gain and has helped my migraines.
20	24	I have never had acne either on or off the pill.
20	25	I have been on different birth controls over the years and due to changes in my hormones I have been spotting before my period so my doctor put me on this BCP and I have getting really bad acne, mood swings, and my lips are very chapped.
20	26	I've been throwing up for the past 2 days and ever since starting I've gotten horrible acne.
20	27	Immediately starting, I stopped getting any sort of bleeding and started getting cyst zits around my second week of the pill each month (I never had any acne when I was a teen).
20	28	I don't have severe acne, or weight gain.
20	29	My acne has even cleared up a great deal.
20	30	I also had terrible acne and it has cleared up immensely.
20	31	The first three months I had severe acne.
20	32	I've never had an acne problem until then.
20	33	First month, some cramping (during period only), normal bleeding(yet lasted 10-13 days), no headaches, hormonal jawline acne cleared right up.
20	34	I had every possible side effect- bloating, mood swings, sore chest, acne, spotting, you name it!
20	35	No spotting, mood swings, and my acne has subsided.
20	36	No acne, which I had when I was a teenager and still use Proactiv for.
20	37	The acne that I had treated and somewhat cured is now back and annoying as ever.
20	38	I was on Loestrin for 3 years with no problems but now I have acne which I haven't had for 10yrs.
20	39	Blemish, acne and crying all the time, that's what I got from Minastrin 24 Fe.
20	40	I did notice my acne get worse.
20	41	Because at the age of 42 my whole face is covered in blemishes and acne.
20	42	I've also had severe cramps during my period and acne.
20	43	From the minute I started this bc, I started gaining weight, breaking out and having intense mood swings to the point where I thought I needed to go to the hospital.
20	44	I've never had problems with my skin breaking out and since I've started taking this medication, I've had constant breakouts all over my face.
20	45	I NEVER get acne.. all of a sudden I'm breaking out in places I've never even got pimples.
20	46	I have had terrible tension headaches all year, and all the sudden breaking out all in my T zone of the face.
20	47	Skin is breaking out, I've always struggled with that but Yaz is the only one that helped apparently.
20	48	Only during the brown pills (period pills) when I would usually get my period, I get a couple pimples.
20	49	Sometimes deep cystic pimples and get bloated.
20	50	No cramping or pimples.
20	51	Blind pimples.
20	52	The only side effect I have seen is very mild blemishes, which does bother me because before starting use of the medication I rarely ever got pimples.
20	53	There was not a day my boobs weren't sore and my cramps and back pain were awful.
20	54	I have never experienced any side effects that I'm aware of, my periods are very regular, and my cramps are much lighter.
20	55	The only negatives that I've noticed are the first week of pills I was nauseated every morning but that passed, it causes some mood swings that my parents noticed as well, and my cramps haven't fully gone away but they are much more manageable due to regular period and only last 2 days instead 4.
20	56	I started taking this for extremely painful cramps and heavy periods.
20	57	I still need heavy doses of pain medicine for 2-3 of those days to even tolerate my cramps (which of course wrecks my digestive system.)
20	58	It has not helped my cramps, makes me nauseous and I have developed heavy depression from time to time with no reason to.
20	59	My periods weren't bad (no cramps, heavy bleeding, etc) but most of those 10 days my period was light and I wore a panyliner because a tampon was irritating.
20	60	Usually when I get my period I get heavy bleeding, severe cramps, nausea,I throw up, dizziness,back pains, every symptom in the book, I get it at the worst level so I tried this pill it's stopped the puking and nausea, I still get very tired but the cramps aren't as bad as they were.
20	61	I had the worst cramps, and I usually don't get cramps during my periods.
20	62	The first few months were great, no crazy side effects and my period was super light- no cramps and lasted about 4 days at most.
20	63	No terrible cramps anymore and my period has pretty much disappeared!
20	64	I have been taking Minastrin 24 Fe  for 3 years now and I have no more cramps or period ever!
20	65	Before I used to suffer from horrible cramps and heavy period but now I feel amazing every month!
20	66	My period has been heavy for four days and I have cramps.
20	67	My Experience were constant weight gain migraines very bad abdominal pain mood swings and heavy periods and bad cramps.
20	68	I went on it and the only pro was a four day period, basically no period at all, just brown, also barely any cramps.
20	69	One day after not taking the medicine, I started bleeding heavily and having severe cramps.
20	70	My periods were very heavy for days one and two with some of the worst cramps I've ever had.
20	71	Periods were much shorter and lighter but cramps were kind of bad.
20	72	I was only on this pill (only birth control I've ever taken) and it was awful...a period every two weeks, awful cramps and mood swings, weight gain, and to top it all off A BLOOD CLOT IN MY LUNG!
20	73	No cramps.
20	74	NO weight gain, NO cramps, NO mood swings, and I get my period for 1-2 days max!!!!!
20	75	Periods are just as bad as before I was on the pill, cramps, bloating, and heaviness of bleeding varies.
20	76	I experienced what I would call a very heavy period (changing my pad every 45 min or wearing adult diapers) 2 times in one month and the cramps are horrible.
20	77	I was suffering from intense period symptoms-- overwhelmingly bad cramps that left me bedridden for at least 2 days, dizziness, uncomfortably heavy flow, irregularity, and periods that lasted up to 9 days.
20	78	no cramps.
20	79	I have pcos so bc helps with my bleeding and cramps.
20	80	While I do appreciate that a lot, I have NEVER suffered from so many leg cramps in my life.
20	81	I get very little cramps each month - usually only lasting a day.
20	82	I used to have terrible cramps & heavy period, but since I've been on minastrin I spot for 2 days at the most & really don't even need more than a panty liner, also barely any cramping.
20	83	And it's supposed to help reduce cramping  but it actually worsened my cramps.
20	84	I am 19 years old and because of how bad my cramps used to be I have been on birth control since I was 15.
20	85	I get cramps randomly in class and have discharge in my underwear.
20	86	I never have a cramp a day in my life until I started this pill and now along with the cramps comes bleeding and horrible stomach pain.
20	87	It served its purpose, no cramps, pregnancy, and a light period.
20	88	The reason I started taking Minastrin is because I had very severe period cramps that often caused me to throw up and pass out, and since I've stopped getting my period, obviously this problem has been solved.
20	89	Ever since I've been getting my period I've had dier cramps to the point where id have to miss school for 2 days each month and take sleepy medicine to knock me out.
20	90	Minastrin absolutely releaved my cramps.
20	91	And wanted to start birth control Bc I have bad cramps.
20	92	I also had painful cramps 8/9 days...... Again wtf.... Anyways, I've also noticed my vision isn't as sharp as it was before I started taking it and I most recently have had depressive thoughts.
20	93	I get cramps periodically and I get spotting at random times although very very light.
20	94	My cramps are still present, but they aren't as bad.
20	95	I also would get awful cramps, backaches, and headaches during my periods.
20	96	I don't get cramps very often at all and I haven't noticed a change in my sex drive.
20	97	So far on this pill I've had short, light periods with very minimal cramps.
20	98	My period only occurs on the placebo days and is very light and with minor cramps that a few period relief pills help.
20	99	I find I have cramps all the time, I get mad very easily, no sex drive whatsoever.
20	100	My period was light with minimal cramps and PMS.
20	101	In fact, it drastically reduced the length and severity of my periods (2 days of panty liners vs. 7 days of super tampons), I no longer suffer from cramps or bloating, and I actually lost 5-6 lbs.
20	102	It's also caused mood swings, headaches (and I never get those), vision blurriness here and there, cramps, bloating, gassy, all the upsetting side effects.
20	103	I have been off for 4 months and my periods now last 3 days and I have little to no cramping.
20	104	Even after my period I experienced cramping still more on one side then the other.
20	105	Started on Manestein 24 Fe to help balance out my cramping & the heavy bleeding during my periods.
20	106	It's not even cramping which is what scares me.
20	107	But the abdominal pain and cramping.
20	108	I had never had cramping with periods or any kind of pms symptoms for that matter, and have always been a very laid back person.
20	109	I also had TERRIBLE periods with clots and cramping.
20	110	I regret not finding these sooner like when I was in highe school and experience painful cramping.
20	111	My gyno switched me from Loestrin to this because I was having in between spotting and cramping.
20	112	Now on my 4th month I had a day of spotting, no cramping, and that's it.
20	113	In the beginning it was ok. A week later I started spotting & cramping like my period was coming.
20	114	It's literally 2 legs cramping up in the middle of the night on a nightly basis.
20	115	The good thing about this pill was that it basically reduced my period to a once-a-month light period that lasted a day and I didn't experience any cramping for the 10 months that I was on it.
20	116	No periods, no cramping, no hormonal issues.
20	117	My OBGYN recommended I get on the pill due to severe cramping and unpredictable periods.
20	118	I was having spotting and cramping every month.
20	119	Well, I have not felt mood swings, cramping or overly emotional at all.
20	120	I had severe cramping and bled for 21 days my period before this birth control was only 4 days.
20	121	I've experienced mood swings, and cramping.
20	122	It may seem like a pro for some but when I miss 3 months and only get my period for 2 days and it's light and looks as if I am spotting... That worries me.
20	123	After giving birth in Jan 2015 I started a diff pill in March then started spotting which led me to switch pills.
20	124	I had spotting between every single period that usually lasted around 7 days, sometimes more.
20	125	Third month no spotting but had a full blown period for 7 days - the whole last week of the pill pack.
20	126	I take it at the exact time every single day and yet somehow my period will start like 2 weeks before I'm supposed to get it and it will last for like a week of just pure spotting.
20	127	I've been on it for 2 months and I'm still spotting and now I have side effects!
20	128	I stopped taking it because I couldn't stand the spotting...well of course that turned into a heavy period.
20	129	And here I am...spotting after my period, and I have blood clots.
20	130	I had accidentally forgot to take my birth control for a day about two days ago, so yesterday I took 2 when I remembered I didn't take it (followed instructions) and started spotting soon after.
20	131	I do get spotting the week before my period which is non existent.
20	132	Well its only my second month almost third and my experience has been very well until I randomly got my period and since then have been spotting since then.
20	133	I've had no mood swings, depression, weight gain, irregular spotting, etc.
20	134	However, I did experience SEVERE spotting and breakthrough bleeding, even after being on the pill for three months.
20	135	It's my very first pill & I haven't had any problems with weight gain, mood, or even spotting in between periods.
20	136	Not even experiencing spotting.
20	137	Haven't had my period in 4 months only some spotting.
20	138	The first 2 months were tough to get through, with spotting, bloating, mood swings, etc.
20	139	I switched onto this pill bc I was having spotting and constant yeast infections on other pills.
20	140	I can successfully skip periods without spotting.
20	141	Miss the pill by an hour or so without spotting.
20	142	I'm on my 4th pack of these pills and all of a sudden, since Thursday of week 2 (it's now Saturday), I've been spotting on and off, which I thought would happen the first three months, but it's month 4 and just starting now.
20	143	It's constant spotting for almost a week at a time.
20	144	I'm tired of the spotting, but they said give it a few months.
20	145	However, I noticed a lot of mood changes, a decrease in sex drive, weight gain, lots of spotting, and I never missed a pill.
20	146	While starting I did have the normal spotting until my body was used to it.
20	147	Also, my periods are lighter and shorter, but I still have a little spotting.
20	148	Spotting is a severe problem, I have to wear pads majority of the time (two weeks at the most with no spotting).
20	149	But I had a lot of spotting before I got my period which was annoying.
20	150	I still spot at random times of the year.
20	151	This pill makes you bleed and spot ALL the TIME.
20	152	I would spot but at random times.
20	153	The first week after doing so was great but then I started to spot.
20	154	But, I haven't had a period since I've started the pill & I've only spotted (so lightly) only once.
20	155	The second month I spotted for one week prior to my actual period.
20	156	Aside from a random day in the first month that I was extremely emotional and two weeks out of month two when I spotted constantly, I haven't had any other noticeable side effects.
20	157	I have a headache every single day..
20	158	As I type this I have a throbbing headache on the left side of my head.
20	159	It does give you headaches, and it does  make me cry a lot, which is abnormal for someone who has no emotional outbursts, ever.
20	160	With Minastrin I have been getting regular migraines and had headaches every day.
20	161	I did have horrible headaches for the first few weeks.
20	162	I had extreme headaches, nausea, and anxiety.
20	163	My period was regular and short (but this has never been a problem for me anyway) I gained weight, had an increase in frequency and severity of my headaches , sometimes lasting for days at a time with no relief, and my skin has gone crazy!
20	164	First time taking it I had PVCs and then the second time had rapid heart rate, headaches, mood swings, and couldn't catch my breath.
20	165	Weird temple headaches off and on.
20	166	Iritable and nauseas with temple headaches.
20	167	I like this medication because for me it has done a great job on easing my headaches and nausea.
20	168	No headaches, no weight gain, periods are lighter, some emotional stuff but I mean, I can fix that & so can anyone else; but just like anything else, everyone's body will react differently to it.
20	169	I do have slight headaches daily, but not anything Tylenol can't fix and they are slowly subsiding.
20	170	Terrible headaches, heavy bleeding throughout the month.
20	171	I gained a lot of weight and had a significant increase in headaches.
20	172	My breasts got larger and although I haven't noticed any weight gain, I have noticed headaches and nausea.
20	173	No unusual headaches or bleeding, etc.
20	174	I have been on it for two months, and have had daily headaches since starting.
20	175	I would take this over the scary migraine and heavy fainting periods anytime.
20	176	I experienced several side effects including breakthrough bleeding, migraines, bloating, weight gain (5-7 pounds) and horrible mood swings.
20	177	Unless you want a period longer than a week, migraines, and uncontrollable mood swings.
20	178	It also made my migraines way worse.
20	179	I had NO side effects of this pill, I was put on it to help with migraines and ovarian cysts.
20	180	My doctor put me on it to stop my migraines after switching from Yaz.
20	181	Still getting migraines.
20	182	I used to take the regular combined pill and would OFTEN get terrible migraines with black auras.
20	183	My sex drive has also been much, much lower.
20	184	I'm gaining weight, constant burning sensation on my right side, losing hair like crazy, no sex drive, and am now a hyperchondriac.
20	185	I thought it was the freshman 15 but its not... Also theres been a HUGE decrease in sex drive.
20	186	Felt depressed, no energy, literally cried everyday for absolutely no reason and had no sex drive.
20	187	Loestrin made me super nauseous, very moody and angry, and completely killed my sex drive.
20	188	I'll admit, in the beginning I was slightly moody and I have noticed a slight decrease in sex drive, but nothing too major.
20	189	My periods get heavier each month, I have absolutely NO sex drive, and I've never been depressed or had anxiety, but this definitely has made me depressed.
20	190	I also have almost a non existent sex drive which sucks.
20	191	I've been on this birth control for 3 months: I haven't had a period, I've gained 10 lbs, my face is broke out, my hair is falling out, I have no sex drive, more frequent moods of depression, this is the worst and I'm getting off it ASAP
20	192	I had no type of sex drive whatsoever and I'm always in a mood.
20	193	Also I have no sex drive putting a strain on my relationship.
20	194	I have very bad crampscramps, loss of appetite, and lowered my sex drive tremendously.
20	195	I am angry, irritated, moody, depressed, and I have absolutely no sex drive.
20	196	I also have no sex drive which I am not sure if that is from the pill or the slight depression from the pill.
20	197	Sex drive has been gone since starting.
20	198	No sex drive.
20	199	I'm constantly crying, I'm in constant PMDD mode, and my sex drive is literally non-existent.
20	200	Minastrin may work for other women but the no sex drive and Weight gain was enough for me to throw in the towel.
20	201	And my sex drive has dropped.
20	202	I had been on a different BCP for over 20 years and had a generally low libido but pretty much no period with that pill.
20	203	I went off to have a child then retuned to the same pill and became very emotional and depressed with a worse libido.
20	204	My doctor changed me to Minastrin and my emotions were much better and libido improved also.
20	205	My mood has changed and so has my libido, which is crazy because I'm like the female version of Christian Grey (Fifty Shades of Grey reference) I gained 6 FREAKING pounds, I already can't see things that are far away and this pills has made it worse.
20	206	It decreased my libido which is something that I've never experienced before.
20	207	But-- I lost my libido completely and felt that I gained more weight on my thighs (and cellulite) despite eating healthy and working out-- never had this problem previously.
20	208	I did notice the weight gain but I quit smoking at the same time so I don't really know what caused it.
20	209	I haven't had problems with skin or weight gain.
20	210	I've never had weight gain like this in my entire life, 10-12 pounds in just a month.
20	211	I've never had a problem with weight gain, and I haven't experienced any since I've been on the pill.
20	212	However, after a month and a half into our marriage...about month ago, I started developing extreme mood swings, depression, weird thoughts I couldn't seem to cope with, suicidal thoughts, emotional about everything, losing feeling for my husband (who believe me I adore and love so very much), 15 to 17 pound weight gain, panic attacks, depression, anxiety, fatigue, swollennes in my legs and feet, and even one of my big toes started to go numb.
20	213	I've experienced weight gain, nausea, and bloating but my cycles are light and only lasts 2 - 4 days.
20	214	in the first pack, my skin cleared up and there was no weight gain, and I had the lightest period of my life!!!
20	215	No mood swings, no weight gain, no weird side effects for me.
20	216	But I've noticed weight gain.
20	217	No side effects, no weight gain, I take at night before sleeping so that could help people with side effects.
20	218	However one side effect is excessive weight gain.
20	219	Good to try but weight gain is a major con!
20	220	I haven't had other weight gain.
20	221	The weight gain, on top of the bloating, is more than enough for me to stop taking this pill because I would rather deal with the pain of endometriosis than deal with this weight gain.
20	222	The major issues I had while taking this pill was terrible stomachaches, and extremely heavy breakthrough bleeding; however I did not experience mood swings, weight gain, or any other adverse effects.
20	223	Immediate weight gain.
20	224	I have also not experienced any weight gain so far.
20	225	I have not noticed any weight gain...if anything I've noticed a decrease in my appetite.
20	226	While taking Minastrin, I feel like myself and I have had no weight gain.
20	227	My skin was the worst its ever been and I gained weight (I'd been on birth control for 8 years before this and never gained).
20	228	I never gained weight either.
20	229	I gained almost no weight (maybe just water weight because I do get kind of bloated), my skin has been great and my periods are around 3 days.
20	230	I've gained about 25 pounds on this pill, even though I eat healthier and exercise more than I did before starting it.
20	231	I have not gained any weight.
20	232	I noticed I'm not losing any fat, instead I gained about 3lbs and constantly feel like I'm retaining water.
20	233	I gained 7lbs in the first month even though I'm active and eat very healthy.
20	234	second pack was a little rough on my skin and I had gained five pounds, but by the third pack my skin was crystal clear again and I had lost the weight I had gained.
20	235	Since taking this pill I have gained 15 pounds and counting.
20	236	And I have gained over 30 pounds.
20	237	Lost all the weight I gained on minastrin.
20	238	My physician switched me to Minastrin and I have gained weight, I am so lathargic and tired all of the time.
20	239	The first 2 weeks, I was an emotional train-wreck, I've gained a bit of weight, but I'm also on some new meds for my diabetes, which could also be the cause.
20	240	Loestrin was perfect - I didn't even feel the effects of the pill (never gained weight, suffered from mood swings, etc.).
20	241	I gained 10 lbs even though I work out 5 days/week and watch my diet.
20	242	Yes I have gained weight and emotional sensitivity.
20	243	I have gained a good bit of weight in my thighs and lower stomach, again not sure if that is related to Minastrin.
20	244	I didn't experience any nausea at all, I never felt dizzy, and I felt very emotionally stable.
20	245	Along with nausea and drowsiness.
20	246	nausea within within 4-5 hours.
20	247	Weird pain in my jaw followed by extreme nausea.
20	248	When I vomited slightly, I forced myself to vomit more when the nausea became too uncomfortable.
20	249	I also have more mood swings, and nausea.
20	250	It caused me no nausea and the bloating is my only side effect.
20	251	I loved it at first because there was no nausea!
20	252	The 21 day period, the heavy clots, the nausea, and irritable state just was not worth it.
20	253	I have nausea off and on, gas/bloating and an inability to orgasm since starting it.
20	254	The only thing that bothered me in the beginning was that I would get so nauseated at night after I would take the pill, but after a month my body got use to it and I had absolutely no other problems.
20	255	This drug made me so nauseous for over a year!
20	256	I was unbelievably nauseous when I first started and threw up several times.
20	257	Every first week of each month I was dizzy and felt like I was in a fog and the rest of the weeks I was so nauseous that I couldn't eat, go to the gym, or do anything.
20	258	I've suffered from depression and anxiety since high school but some days it seemed unbearable to the point I've gotten nauseous and it was never that bad.
20	259	I've been nauseous since the first pill, with daily stomach troubles.
20	260	It made me nauseous the first two months.
20	261	Now I'm extremely nauseous ALL THE TIME.
20	262	I'm nauseous all the time, which is only relieved by burping or breaking wind.
20	263	I had mood swings, depression, and was nauseous all the time.
20	264	Not only that, but the mint taste makes me very nauseous to this day and it's been 6 months.
20	265	Although I don't feel nauseous or dizziness.
20	266	Constant dizziness and fatigue.
20	267	My mood swings have decreased drastically since being on Minastrin.
20	268	I have noticed my mood swings getting pretty bad at certain times but overall the pill works great for me!
20	269	This pill has been great so far, but after reading other people's experiences with side effects I feel relieved knowing that I'm not the only one that has frequent mood swings the week before I start my placebo pills.
20	270	The only downside to it is the mood swings, which were way worse the first year or two I started the pill.
20	271	I was on this pill for almost a week and had to stop it due to EXTREME mood swings and massive depression and anxiety.
20	272	I was also experiencing strong pms type mood swings as well.
20	273	BUT my mood swings are horrible all the time, And I find myself bleeding heavily at random times of the month all the time...wouldn't recommend
20	274	Crazy mood swings, lots of crying, don't recommend at all.
20	275	But then, my period lasted for two weeks (tmi part: ultra heavy, and I'm usually a regular tampon kind of person), I got HORRIBLE mood swings, I felt depressed, and just always so angry.
20	276	No unusual mood swings.
20	277	I didn't experience mood swings or weight gain/loss.
20	278	Then around the 4th month I started getting break through bleeding that last for days and heavier periods, after reading these other comments now I know what has been causing the mood swings.
20	279	My mood swings were crazy and I felt awful on this birth control.
20	280	Limited mood swings, No loss of sexual desire.
20	281	As soon as I started taking it I got horrible mood swings, which have continued on and off ever since (I give my boyfriend all the credit in the world for putting up with it).
20	282	My husband and I almost split because of my mood swings.
20	283	I have had the worse mood swings and have been bleeding for a whole month.
20	284	And I agree about the mood swings its really affecting my anxiety and my mood swings are all over the place.
20	285	I've struggled with depression in the past and this gave me such bad mood swings that I have not felt this depressed in the longest time.
20	286	Also, I have multiple mood swings a day due to Min24Fe, but I pull myself together.
20	287	But the worst part was the terrible mood swings.
20	288	It made me have mood swings and I was always angry at the world.
20	289	If I wasn't continuously on my period than I would rate it at an 8 because sometimes it gives me mood swings as well.
20	290	I had mood swings, bloating and bleeding every day for a month.
20	291	During this time period I had horrible mood swings and I was constantly emotional.
20	292	I had bad mood swings each period.
20	293	This is the first birth control I've ever taken and I've had a few mood swings, at the same time I'm still a teenager and hormones are flying everywhere so it doesn't truly bother me.
20	294	It was awful, gave me horrible mood swings and I kept having huge fights with my boyfriend and everyone and I knew it was this pill because that is not like me at all.
20	295	As soon as I switched the mood swings went away.
20	296	I haven't experienced any mood swings or pain.
20	297	I've had severe back pain, and mild mood swings, I want to cry all the time & it's affecting my relationship.
20	298	I had horrible side effects from this pill, besides the weird periods I had mood swings that made me miserable.
20	299	I also was experiencing mood changes where I would either be down in the dumps or angry at the world.
20	300	I've always been a nervous person but my anxiety went through the roof on this pill.
20	301	It was great when I was not sexually active but now that I am - it makes me nervous.
20	302	I was switched from Loestrin 24 to this since it was discontinued and at first I was super nervous because it was chewable, but I liked Loestrin so I went with it.
20	303	I also had so much anxiety and I would even wake up anxious frenquently.
20	304	I've started waking in the middle of the night with panic attacks and feel anxious pretty much 24/7.
20	305	All I can say is it was not bad for the first 8 months (short periods, weight loss) but somewhere around my 9th month taking it, I started to experience terrible anxiety, depression, loss of my sense of self, and really darkt houghts.
20	306	Do seriously, don't take this pill if you have a history with anxiety or depression!
20	307	However, I blamed the anxiety on getting older and maybe the stress of school.
20	308	I have been on SSRIs for 7 years now and my depression and anxiety are relatively under control.
20	309	My breaking point with this bc was one night when I went through the cycle of angry/violent thoughts, to intense anxiety, to feeling completely normal.
20	310	Some may see this as a pro, but I personally had anxiety by it.
20	311	My anxiety was so bad about pack five that I took two pregnancy tests just to rule out the weirdness.
20	312	I have always had anxiety and depression, and it's worsened everything .
20	313	On top of that I have had panic attacks, high anxiety, suicidal thoughts, you name it.
20	314	Other than the breast tenderness and weird cycles, the only other symptom I had was constipation.
20	315	I haven't had any side effects except breast tenderness once a month.
20	316	I also ended up gaining nearly 10 pounds and had very tender breasts all the time.
20	317	Lastly, I'm pretty sure my body is reacting to the medication because I've never had a yeast infection... but for some strange reason I've been experiencing discomfort.
20	318	I've had a chronic yeast infection straight through the 3 months I've been on it and it won't respond to any prescription medication.
20	319	I have  chronic  yeast infections.
20	320	The only thing I noticed for a period of time was constant yeast infections, which was pretty miserable.
21	1	I have terrible back pain, right ovary pain, acne, can’t loose weight, extreme excessive sweating, pain with sex, and headaches.
21	2	Like bloating, constipation or acne after eating to much sugar/salt/lipids... you will know of that is your case.
21	3	I’ve tried all different types of birth control pills and all have given me bad side effects (weight gain, depression, low libido, acne, etc.).
21	4	My acne did get a little worse and has stayed like that until getting it treated.
21	5	Weight gain, terrible sluggishness, acne like a mother and continuous bleeding.
21	6	Ever since I have had migraines and acne on chin and back and sometimes I get a sharp pain in the area where the mirena is placed, it hasn't moved, or embedded.
21	7	My sex life is non-existent, the hormones are also affecting my mood (not in a good way) and I've developed acne at 42 on my usually pristine skin.
21	8	A 3-6 month adjustment window filled with acne, mood swings, no sex and irregular bleeding is not looking so appealing.
21	9	Now I never had any issues with my first 2 mirena , but iIve noticed since I got my last one back in August 2016 after my 3rd baby that I've been having constant bleeding, horrible acne and my sex drive is out the window.
21	10	BUT, I have acne.
21	11	I had noticed acne on my back and break-outs on my face and forehead.
21	12	I haven't had any weight gain or acne symptoms that everyone talks about in their reviews.
21	13	I always had acne on my chin.
21	14	I break out with acne some and get bloated but nothing major.
21	15	I had horrible headaches, started to develop acne , and I almost had a stroke one night .
21	16	I've gained 20 pounds in 6 months, and have acne so bad you'd think I never washed my face/neck.
21	17	Since then I have also gained 20 lbs and got acne on my chin/neck/chest.
21	18	I didn't want to try pills because I hate the "trial and error" part of it and I am terrified of acne or weight gain and also I'm just not responsible enough to take it daily.
21	19	No appetite change, no more acne than usual.
21	20	In addition, I experienced horrible cramps for 3 weeks every month, my digestion was off all of the time, worsening acne, water retention, increased appetite, extreme bloating, a rash/hives all over my chest, lowered sex drive, sex was very painful and would restart my period, the skin on my nipples started to peel and I could feel it poking inside of me 24/7.
21	21	Gained weight and got acne up my back and neck the next few months.
21	22	Since I've been on it I've had a decrease/change in libido, continual spotting, almost constant cramping, headaches every day, mood swings, increased levels of depression, a ridiculous flare up in acne, lower back pain, and achy/dry eyes (I wear contact lenses and I've never had this problem until the IUD).
21	23	I've had anxiety since then, and horrific, severe acne unlike anything I've ever had.
21	24	It wasn't until after 6 months that I had severe  acne, anxiety/depression, and had gained 20lbs when I had not changed my exercise routine or eating habits.
21	25	I'm an Aesthetician and none of my remedies and practices could get rid of my acne.
21	26	Horrible chin acne, constant bloating, couldn't lose weight at all and developed anxiety and depression to the point I hated myself.
21	27	I started to get severe hormonal chin acne, mood swings, hair loss and dryness.
21	28	I, in my late 30s, have reentered puberty (maybe menopause) with the new found acne and mood swings.
21	29	Downfall I developed acne, depression, anxiety and horrible mood swings.
21	30	However, due to the hormones being local, I noticed the positive benefits I experience with the pill such as not getting acne, came back.
21	31	Honestly couldn't give this a better wrap hardly any bleeding maybe every couple months I spot for a day or two no acne, weight gain or cramps.
21	32	No period, no weight gain, and no acne.
21	33	No significant acne changes or weight gain.
21	34	No weight gain, acne, etc and my sex drive has actually increased (weird right?).
21	35	I typically suffer from hormonal cystic acne, so I will be curious to see if I see any improvement with my skin while on Mirena.
21	36	I have never experienced acne like this before....I seriously break out all the time and I'm 31 years old I wanted the 5 year plan but I'm breaking out like I remember 7th grade
21	37	I did experience pretty bad hormonal acne along my jaw line, but this is because I was on the pill and went off it.
21	38	If you rely on the pill for acne treatment be prepared to head back to the doctor for a topical treatment.
21	39	But a major down fall was major hair loss and major acne on face, chest, and back.
21	40	I'm a hairdresser and spent a ton of money on acne and hair stuff, nothing worked.
21	41	I would still have it in if it wasn't for the hair loss and acne in my mid 30s.
21	42	I haven't experienced any acne, mood swings, etc.
21	43	No acne, no weight gain.
21	44	No acne, no abdominal pain.
21	45	No weight gain, no mood swings, no acne.
21	46	Don't get me started on my acne, weird discharge and chin hairs!!
21	47	The very beginning when having it wasn't so bad but later I started to notice acne, I have never had acne my entire life so it kind of shocked me when I started breaking out really bad.
21	48	There was no treatment for my acne, left my face with acne scars.
21	49	Definitely hoping my acne clears and I lose the weight I've  gained.
21	50	I have used the mirena as it seems to be the most consistent release of hormones, therefor helping mood swings, acne, weight gain etc.
21	51	Around 9 months iIstarted to see an increase in acne.
21	52	After 1.5 years the acne turned into severe rosacea and cystic acne.
21	53	Oh and really bad acne!
21	54	I've lost weight, my acne has cleared up, no periods, and best of all no babies.
21	55	My skin was in the most beautiful state before I started and dramatically changed.. My face became very oily and developed acne.
21	56	I experienced extreme dizziness, headaches, mood swings to the point of breaking down once a month, cystic acne, headaches, and extreme bleeding.
21	57	However, it did cause me to develop cystic acne which I didn't have before so consider this possibility before having it put in.
21	58	I have gained 15 pounds, my acne is worse than it has ever been and I am extremely moody and depressed all the time.
21	59	I got cystic acne on a regular basis, which was something that never happened before.
21	60	But I haven't lost my sex drive ( it's gotten better if anything ) , I have not gained any weight, small amount of acne but nothing I can't handle lol.
21	61	My boyfriend was getting poked by the string, severe moodswings, hair loss, acne, a month of spotting...
21	62	Apart from the hair thinning (which I am unsure was from the Mirena) I got really bad acne on my chin area and on my back.
21	63	No weight gain, and no acne.
21	64	As for acne, it has increased!
21	65	No weight gain, no acne, no mood swings.
21	66	I gain 40 pounds, I had acne, I had to use sleeping aids in order to sleep, I have great hair loss, I had zero energy, I had some memory loss at times.
21	67	Weigh gain, spotting for 2 months, cystic acne, depression, daily headaches, always feeling tired.
21	68	Increased arterial blood pressure, headache, mood changes, increase in body weight, especially the upper part, vaginal discharge, and acne.
21	69	As for other side effects, I haven't noticed any weight gain, mood swings, or a noticeable increase in acne, and I am prone to breakouts.
21	70	Mirena = headache, mood swings, bad odor, painful acne, weight gain
21	71	I did like the depo a lot but I broke out with a lot of acne all over my face.
21	72	I never had acne as a teenager so getting it as an adult was torture and humiliating.
21	73	I'm buying pads by the bulk, and went to my dermatologist due to acne!
21	74	Removed 9/2015 after 6 months of weight gain, extreme cystic acne and body acne, exhaustion.
21	75	My acne has gotten worse and I just finally saw a dermatologist.
21	76	I got 2 creams and spironolactone to help with my hormonal acne.
21	77	If you've had acne previous to placement I would recommend seeking treatment from the start instead of suffering to see if it clears as time goes on.
21	78	Had nipple soreness, oily skin, acne, headaches that next month thought I was pregnant but ended up having a late period I've been bleeding every since(about a full month) and now I'm just waiting for another full period to come.
21	79	At this juncture in my life I'm struggling with adult acne.
21	80	I'm concerned that the hormones are no longer affecting me as they did for 3 years and perhaps Mirena is the cause for this extreme case of acne.
21	81	I have noticed some moderate back acne and slight weight gain, but I am unsure whether those can be attributed to other life circumstances at this point.
21	82	Within those 10 months I'd gained 18 pounds (on a 5 foot tall person that's horrible), I was moody, had the worst cramps, hair loss, acne, horrible headaches, the appetite of a sumo wrestler, & didn't want to do anything.
21	83	Got my second January 2015 .It caused a lil weight gain( I went from 130 to 139 )I'm 5'6.Severe acne and oily skin almost over night,I had perfect model skin before.Mood swings.Then June 4 I have the worst shooting stabbing pain of my life,and my shoulder is killing me.I go to the hospital ,I'm pregnant in the largest part of my left tube ,the next morning ,they do surgery to take out the left tube and my baby I just found out about.After surgery I found out I was hemorrhaging so she had to do a c-section cut under my bikini line to get the clots out and I almost bled out .i was white.If I would have stayed home I would have died.
21	84	Im happy with it, except for the acne the first two months but now is disappearing.
21	85	No acne or weight gain, I do have a decrease in libido and i find that if i have an orgasm it is painful as I get cramps after (maybe that increase my decrease desire?
21	86	I hardly ever have acne and did all the time.
21	87	I had no weight gain, no mood swings (hormones are localized with mirena), no acne problems.
21	88	I've had cramping, no sex drive, lack if energy, acne, hair itching, and gained 20 pounds in 4 months.
21	89	I've noticed an increase in appetite & acne on my face that I never had problems with before.
21	90	The acne left dark purple marks on my cheeks, that are just barely disappearing.
21	91	However, it gave me debilitating cystic acne.
21	92	I spent thousands of dollars on acne prescriptions and countless depressed days due to the severity of the acne.
21	93	The acne I've gotten since July has been just horrible also.
21	94	I am kind of upset at the negativity that I have seen posted: bad acne, cramps, wt gain, low sex drive...all of which I was afraid of.
21	95	I was told in the past that chin acne is due to hormones.
21	96	No changes in acne.
21	97	I haven't noticed any weight gain or acne.
21	98	Only a little cramping after insertion, periods stop within 2 months, no acne but a little lower back pain and weight gain.
21	99	No weight gain, acne, or change in mood or libido.
21	100	The only downside I have to say about it is that because Mirena doesn't have the same hormones as The Pill, my acne isn't being regulated like it was before, but it's definitely not unmanageable.
21	101	I have only had it 6.5 months and in that time I have had a constant dull back pain, uncontrollable acne and I have also gained 25 pounds.
21	102	No weight gain but I have been breaking out a lot, this is a huge concern because I have always had a clear face, I just purchased some acne creams, I'll see if that helps.
21	103	However immediately after having it inserted, I started experiencing severe acne (I'm 35) so this is seriously unacceptable.
21	104	There is a medicine that apparently works (I did lots of research online) that's called spironolactone that's used for high blood pressure and acne as well as a few other things.
21	105	I have had no mood swings acne or weight gain.
21	106	I have acne now haven't had it since I was 18, I've gained weight and I get sleepy very easily now.
21	107	Then I noticed my hair started thinning out and I was getting really bad acne.
21	108	I finally got it taken out a little after having it for a year and am still having acne problems, and my hair still seems to be falling out.
21	109	My acne has improved a great deal (which is a huge positive).
21	110	Mirena has cleared my face from acne, I lost 12 pounds, and has stopped my period completely.
21	111	I haven't had any abnormal acne or mood swings.
21	112	I have bloating and cramping often, severe mood swings, anxiety and panic and acne breakouts on my back.
21	113	My OB told me that pills will clear my acne.
21	114	I also noticed my acne disappeared, my hair started growing faster and thicker and I went up a full breast size!
21	115	My period is very light now, no weight gain, headache or mood swings and most important no acne, that I have had problems with in the past.
21	116	I don't think I have other side effects such as acne or weight gain.
21	117	I now have acne that I've never had, the menstrual cycle lasts longer then it normally did, and I've gained weight.
21	118	I get more acne than I used to but its worth knowing that I'm unlikely to become pregnant.
21	119	I have headaches cramping and my acne is breaking out horribly.
21	120	Yes, my acne got worse, but it was because it got better when I was on the pill.
21	121	I think my acne just went back to its pre-birth control levels.
21	122	I NEVER had acne in my life, maybe one pimple every couple months.
21	123	I had mood swings, depression, acne, tired but couldn't sleep.
21	124	Mood swings, Headaches, hair loss, acne, bad weight gain.
21	125	Had trouble with mood swings, weight gain, and bad acne through the pill... and continued to have heavy and irregular spotting between periods, with the pill.
21	126	No period, my acne has cleared up, I've got more energy throughout the day, and I'm very pleased with it.
21	127	I've had it for two months, up to now I've bleed since day 1, acne, no sex drive, and dryness!
21	128	However for about the last year and a 1/2 I have had crazy side effects off and on: weight loss (not complaining about that) anxiety, depression, no sex drive, nausea, sore breast, bloating, stomach pain, cystic acne.
21	129	I love the Mirena, I have had no more acne then I had before the Mirena, gained no weight, and only on occasion have slight bloating and cramps.
21	130	My hormonal acne had gotten worse along my jaw line, creating cystic acne, however I would rather keep Mirena regardless.
21	131	I have a higher sex drive, no acne (which is wonderful because I've had problems with adult acne), hand lost 5 pounds that WEEK, and now am steadily losing weight.
21	132	Terrible skin, worst of my life (I'm 35): A little over 2 months into it I started getting acne and incredibly greasy skin.
21	133	But no acne, weight gain, or moodiness.
21	134	It's been three months and I still have severe cramps, spotting daily , acne, lower back pain and severe pitting edema in my lower extremities, about a 20 lb weight gain.
21	135	I have had hair loss, itchy scalp, lower back pain, oily face recently and oily back along with acne.
21	136	Had no problems with it, no side effects although I have read bad reviews with abdominal and breast pain, depression, no sex drive acne all sorts.
21	137	I already get acne but not got any worse, I have lost a stone.
21	138	I haven't gained any weight or had problems with acne, mood or libido.
21	139	I have not gained weight or had problems with acne.
21	140	My acne has gotten worse, but it goes through bad patches anyway so don't know if it is related.
21	141	My acne has started up.
21	142	I don't get crazy moods, weight gains, acne and more like how I did get with other birth control methods I've tried in the past.
21	143	No acne.
21	144	Headaches, dry during sex, acne (on estrogen pill), crazy mood swings and mental breakdowns anytime stress came.
21	145	I experienced no increased acne, mood swings, hair loss, weight gain, nor lowered sex drive, as a lot of other has mentioned.
21	146	Over the past 2 years I have had panic attacks, severe mood swings, depression, had my hair fall off, bad acne, dizzyness, migraines, constant infections, and although 6 months ago I changed my eating habits and exercise 9 hours a week, I have not lost one lb.
21	147	I have had terrible weight gain with other forms of birth control, so this was a large concern; so far no weight gain, no mood swings, no acne, no bad side effects at all!
21	148	Starting around the year and a half mark I started getting more back pain, hair loss (severe), acne (which I've never had a problem with).
21	149	Hopefully I don't have any of the side effects like acne.
21	150	I have always had acne, and in the beginning  it cleared up a bit, now it is getting bad again.
21	151	I haven't gained any weight and no acne and no cramps.
21	152	Weight gain, acne, depression and so on.
21	153	It's been 3 months and I have also lost a ton of hair, no acne but really depressed and high anxiety!
21	154	I experienced migraines every month and severe mood swings, and acne, I hardly ever had break outs before.
21	155	My acne was fine, moods were fine, I hadn't gained any extra weight.
21	156	I've had horrible acne for 2 weeks, severe cramping and bloating and I've been feeling like a totally whack job and then suddenly I started to bleed...and then I bled and bled and bled.
21	157	My acne is going away, I've stopped bleeding and I don't feel crazy anymore.
21	158	The cramping has gotten better and I have very light bleeding but I now have bad acne and no sex drive.
21	159	I feel bloated often, I've recently started getting acne which I never had even as a teen.
21	160	Downsides: I bled for for 3-4 weeks after I got it, and it made my acne flare up like crazy!
21	161	The pill gave me acne, weight gain, mood swings and nausea.
21	162	I've had oily skin and acne my whole life but am able to control it.
21	163	The cons for me were: oily hair/skin, back acne (which I never usually have), and severe unexplainable joint pain.
21	164	I didn't lose my hair, gain weight, or get acne.
21	165	It is so convenient that the minimal side effects (mainly some acne) don't bother me at all.
21	166	Also I have no sex drive, have mood swings, constipation, insomina, mild headaches and I used to have perfect clear skin and now I have mild acne, I would like to get the Mirena out because of the bad symptoms I have but it's been almost 2 years and I'm not pregnant so that's great.
21	167	I am very happy with my Mirena, BESIDES the horrible acne.
21	168	Constanly tired, acne constant around jaw line (never had much problem with before), cravings for food and biggest one hair coming out in clumps.
21	169	In the last few months I've had cramping, spotting, relentless acne and worsening depression that I can't contribute to anything else.
21	170	Only side effect is lately noticing acne along the jaw line!
21	171	Since the beginning of 2009, I have been fighting with acne which I thought was due to stress or other factors.
21	172	I recently visited an acne clinic and after my medical history to the doctor he suggested that I take Aldactone 25mg (it is a water pill) to help balance my hormone as Mirena could be the cause of my hormonal imbalance.
21	173	The day of my insertion I started cramping so bad I was nauseated but was fine the next day about the only thing that has gotten better is that I don't have menstrual cramps any longer I have experienced weight gain and fluctuation but I've always struggled with my weight so I don't solely blame that on Mirena, as well as my acne its hasn't improved or gotten worse but Mirena is my preferred method of birth control, it works and I couldn't do the pill or the shot.
21	174	Insertion was fine, no cramping, no acne.
21	175	The acne is like cysts in some areas.
21	176	My only compliant would be an increase in acne, that's really been my only side effect.
21	177	I experienced awful acne that I had to see a dermatologist and use 2 prescriptions to help (still didn't clear it up) and experienced a lot of pain during the time I would normally have a period.
21	178	I think I am having this thing changed out for a non-hormonal releasing IUD since I have had cramping, slight depression, weight gain and acne since it has been placed and no other symptoms before that.
21	179	For about a year though I have been extremely moody, I have anxiety, I got painful cystic acne on my face, neck, even on my head.
21	180	I have noticed some acne which is funny because I always had smooth skin.
21	181	No acne problems but I have been tired and moody since it's been put in.
21	182	I started to get acne.
21	183	Also, a lot of women complain of getting a ton of acne, cramping, hair loss and other side effects.
21	184	I also just recently started to get acne.
21	185	However, I have not had a period since...no cramps, no bleeding, no headaches, no acne.
21	186	I haven't had any mood swings, depression, or acne like others have stated.
21	187	My acne hasn't changed, gotten worse or totally cleared up.
21	188	Other than that I have had zero weight gain (I've actually lost 5lbs), no acne (something I was worried about because I have sensitive skin) and only slight moodiness around the time of my cycle (I would get moody at this time before I had Mirena, also).
21	189	The acne started first.
21	190	I do get slight headaches and have acne but both are manageable.
21	191	On my period I experienced severe pain, heavy bleed and acne.
21	192	Then I started to gain weight, developed moderately severe acne, and after a year I started having heavier periods than before.
21	193	No mood swings, no acne, and haven't gained nor lost a pound.
21	194	My acne is bad.
21	195	I have had no acne.
21	196	I experienced EVERY possible side effect associated with this device: cystic acne, hair loss, weight gain, constant headaches, shooting pain in my lower back and down my legs, severe fatigue, mood swings, constant bleeding and excruciating abdominal pain that almost sent me to the ER on four separate occasions.
21	197	The 1st month my acne was horrible but that decreased in the 3rd month.
21	198	I have also had some problems with acne I NEVER had acne not even as a teenager but I guess those are just a few problems I will deal with as time goes on to prevent pregnancy.
21	199	Well... over the last 10 months,  I have had acne (on my back, arms, face everywhere) and I have never been one to get acne.
21	200	No acne or moodiness, although its only been a week.
21	201	This fourth month I have noticed hip cramps, weight gain, headaches, large hair loss and severe acne.
21	202	Last month I noticed I'm more moody have bad acne.
21	203	It has not affected my skin (although I currently use medication for acne I've had for years).
21	204	Since I have had the Mirena in I have not had a period sometimes I get some light spotting around the time I would normally have my period, the other side effects are what is killing me, I have had the worst acne ever since I got the Mirena, and I have never had acne in my life, it has not stopped for 2 years.
21	205	The Mirena has helped my mood swings and not so much for the acne.
21	206	Acne has been pretty bad, didn't know why that was either (don't usually have acne).
21	207	Then I started to get acne all over my back!
21	208	I never got acne on my back and now it's everywhere.
21	209	Since I had it removed, I have lost 10 pound (which during the time of insertion I gained 50lbs) and my acne has cleared up.
21	210	I haven't had any problems with it except some hair loss but cant really say its more than average and as for acne my face actually has been clearing up.
21	211	I am hoping that I will be fine without the weight gain and acne.
21	212	I did have a little acne at first, but that may have had to do with going off the pill.
21	213	At first it was great, minimal spotting during periods, it was low maintenance, and acne cleared up.
21	214	Multiple yeast infections, dryness during sex, and repeated acne breakouts.
21	215	Have gained about 30 pounds have acne and headaches and backache, so now I am wondering what is next.
21	216	I did not experience the acne and lost my job last year so contributed to the weight gain since not being as active.
21	217	I have moderate acne and this made my face even worse.
21	218	No acne, no mood swings, can't feel it, neither can my partner.
21	219	I have had no acne, some breast tenderness, and some weight gain  - about 10 lbs or so.
21	220	Had painful ovarian cyst, acne, constant vaginal infection, weight gain.
21	221	The insertion was fine, mild cramping, but for the last year and a half I have experienced depression, bad acne, weight gain of about ten kilos, mood swings.
21	222	Side effects to watch out for are severe mood swings, hair loss, depression, acne, dizziness, headaches, memory loss, and insomnia.
21	223	I love it except for the fact that I have acne like a teen.
21	224	I have tried everything to control the acne and nothing seems to work.
21	225	I haven't gained weight, my acne is gone, and my moods are fine.
21	226	As soon as I put it in I got acne, its been a problem for me when I was in my teens and was almost completely gone by time I was 20.
21	227	I have to wash my face every day with acne creams, to help control the break outs, most of which are on my back.
21	228	Not only that but I don't have acne and all of a sudden it's there and it's only getting worse.
21	229	I have experienced acne which I never really had to deal with.
21	230	I had Mirena inserted about six months ago, and other than painful insertion and some moderate acne have really no complaints.
21	231	I now have mood swings, motivation issues, weight gain, acne, and normal period issues.
21	232	I am 28 years old and I have had the Mirena for almost 3 1/2 years, and haven't had any problems other than acne.
21	233	The only thing I hate is the acne part.
21	234	It's not like me to have acne, and I hate it.
21	235	I have tried many different acne medications to clear it up, and so far the only one that has helped it is the murad acne complex..
21	236	No side effects, weight gain, acne, etc, thus far (12 weeks later) despite the pain of insertion, I would do it 100 more times for the benefits.
21	237	I had stuck with it for about 6 months, but my face is breaking out like I am 15 (which I have never had a problem with) and I have had an awful discharge since I have had the IUD.
21	238	However, I admit that I have been breaking out a bit more but I started washing my face twice daily and it has subsided a lot better with occasional breakouts.
21	239	I'm slowly breaking out on my back which never happens and also on my face, I have gained 3lbs, I'm a very active person I workout hard 6 x a week and eat as healthy as possible.
21	240	Other then the weight gain I've started breaking out, not just on my face but on my chest and back.
21	241	Started breaking out some then second month everything got MUCH worse.
21	242	I have had some pimples pop up but totally worth it.
21	243	Still, getting pimples beats getting pregnant for me.
21	244	People say that if they're prescribed 100mg, it works and they have almost no pimples after a few months.
21	245	The only downside is I have noticed an increase in pimples.
21	246	Negative parts: Ive gotten a few more zits every time my period comes around after being on mirena & still get horrible cramps, but definitely not as often: 1/2 days instead of weeks at a time.
21	247	Did get really bad cramps but that was one of the main reasons having the coil was to help with unbearably painful cramps and heavy bleeding.
21	248	I’m 22 years old and I’ve never given birth, the insertion literally felt like period cramps.
21	249	Barely had cramps the rest of the day.
21	250	After insertion the cramps were really bad and I had a lot of bleeding.
21	251	I had bad cramps on and off for a few months and quite a bit of spotting.
21	252	I still get short brief cramps around my period.
21	253	I suggest taking 800mg of ibuprofen before and after because I did have cramps and dizziness for the whole day.
21	254	I was really excited for Mirena because I suffer from seveer cramps and a very heavy period.
21	255	So far bleeding was for the first two days only, no cramps, no discomfort.
21	256	The doctor said to expect cramps.
21	257	The next day I had mild cramps but it wasn't bad.
21	258	I do occasionally get cramps still, but I had those prior so I'm not sure Mirena is to blame.
21	259	I've been on birth control for a while now due to horrendous cramps and excessively heavy cycles.
21	260	It varies from light spotting to full blown period heaviness from day to day (cramps too) and hasn't stopped for 3 weeks.
21	261	(I have had one baby 5 years ago so that might be why my pain was less then other women's) About 10 min - 2 hours after I have fairly painful cramps but nothing unlike my period.
21	262	After getting it inserted, I had severe cramps that lasted for at least 3 months along with constant bleeding and/or spotting.
21	263	These cramps were significantly more painful than my normal cramps.
21	264	My menstrual cramps are different, worse than ever.
21	265	I also want to add that Mirena was recommended to me because of severe cramps that the Pill did not alleviate, but my cramps with Mirena are worse.
21	266	My doc talked me through it, counted 3 potential cramps.
21	267	But I didn't feel any until immediately after & it felt no worse than period cramps.
21	268	My experience has been horrible I've had it in for 5 months and haven't stopped​ bleeding I wouldn't recommend anyone to ever get the mirena and the cramps hurt so bad in my stomach and in my back
21	269	I had some cramps and spotted for almost 2 weeks and was nervous, but reading other people's sounded normal because your body isn't use to it yet.
21	270	It wasn't till I left my doctors that I felt sharp cramps, which only lasted a day.
21	271	I had very little issue with insertion and mild cramps after.
21	272	The cramps were next to unbearable.
21	273	After about the 4th day, the pain and cramps finally started to subside.
21	274	There was a slight complication (apparently my uterus was tilted so the 1st attempt at insertion failed & she had to give me a numbing shot IN THE VAG & adjust my uterus) the 2nd attempt succeeded but the cramps were so intense.
21	275	I had the mirena  inserted 4 days ago now, I decided to get the mirena as I have very very painful period cramps and I had recently moved to a new area and getting the pill was a nightmare.
21	276	While getting the Mirena put in there were 3 cramps, each cramp were worse than the other but none were unbearable.
21	277	I'm 20 years old and I've been on various forms of birth control since I was 16 due to horrible cramps, among other things.
21	278	But after, it was fitted I did experience the worse cramps ever, it was so painful - I've never had children so I don't know if it was because of that.
21	279	A few hours later I had bad cramps which were painful.
21	280	But it's the cramps.
21	281	But then I haven't had no cramps for 2 weeks but now I've got them again.
21	282	I'll give it another few months and if I still have these cramps it's coming out.
21	283	Felt like cramps.
21	284	Little cramps after I got home,  through the night and the next day.
21	285	Spotting and cramps seemed to have decreased so I'm waiting for the day it stops altogether.
21	286	No cramps!
21	287	Every time I try and sleep I get bad cramps.
21	288	I experience cramps for a week, I been spotting almost every day it seems it doesn't want to stop some days is heavy and other days is lighter.
21	289	I've been on the mirena this time for about a month now and have been having brownish discharge no cramps or periods just brownish discharge everyday.
21	290	I had this for a little over a year and it was awful, I had terrible cramps all the time and it made me bleed/hurt every single time I had sex.
21	291	The process itself was extremely painful because I'd never experienced cramps before hand.
21	292	I have had cramps since, including back cramps every day that feel like I am in early labor all
21	293	My period is 95% lighter and lasts only an hour, I never get cramps anymore, and I am comforted by the fact that it is so reliable!
21	294	I didn't bleed at all... no cramps... or any other bad side affects!!!
21	295	I spotted throughout the day, but had no cramps.
21	296	I won't even mention this madness with spotting, constant cramps and bleeding for 2 weeks.
21	297	Every few months I'll get a brief cramp and remember "oh yeah no more cramps, periods, or birth control pills!"
21	298	Had bad cramps all day.
21	299	The first month I had no spotting, but I did get occasional cramps which were really painful.
21	300	However, now I only get mild cramps every once in a while.
21	301	I've no periods and other than tiny cramps every now and again I have no complaints!
21	302	I was put under for the insertion and woke up with no pain at all, obviously feeling sick because I wasn't alowed to eat before they inserted it and after a while i did get cramps and had on and off spotting but after about a month and a half it completely stoped and im period free!!
21	303	That day came, it took literally 30 seconds after the speculum, and no cramps at all.
21	304	After about an hour of drinking straight water, the cramps were hardly bearable but I went home.
21	305	And the cramps were very painful I hated it.
21	306	I share bc i saw so many posts about pain and cramps, and while everyone is different, it's not that scary.
21	307	I have never experienced cramps or sharp pains during my period.
21	308	But from what my mom and the doctors all said apparently that's just what bad period cramps feel like.
21	309	I've now had it for 5 months and get cramps from time to time but they arent bad ones.
21	310	I would overall suggest it to those who are preventing pregnancy more than preventing periods and cramps.
21	311	Daily, I have crippling cramps to where I can no longer continue to drive or walk.
21	312	and the 2 hours after insertion I had awful period-like cramps.
21	313	It was either between Mirena or Paragard-since I have heavy menstrual cycles and cramps and PMS, I chose the Mirena.
21	314	I just started a "cycle" 2 days ago with terror cramps and heavy flow,  but last time i had this kind of period was 8 months ago.
21	315	I laid there for a min and got up I had cramps but the cramps stopped due to me taking ibprofen which helps a lot.
21	316	No cramps, no PMS, no spotting.
21	317	The insertion was extremely painful (I haven't had kids) and I had bad cramps for 2-3 days after.
21	318	Zero cramps.
21	319	I was given prescription pain killers to help with the cramps and have had light bleeding since.
21	320	The after cramps weren't unbearable, but still very uncomfortable.
21	321	I woke up this morning and the cramps were super intense.
21	322	I could feel it when bending and being active and had frequent albeit mild cramps during said activity.
21	323	Weight gain, depression, hair loss, migraines, anxiety, cramps, non stop bleeding for 4 months now.
21	324	However, the IUD has stopped the painful cramps I used to get, my period is still pretty usual, comes right on time, so that's the only reason how I know I'm getting it, because otherwise I wouldn't feel it lol.
21	325	Afterwards I did find myself with menstrual cramps for weeks afterwards,  maybe for the first month.
21	326	I do find that I still may get the cramps, but not always the bleeding.
21	327	The cramps after about a 6 I bleed for 6 months straight around the third month it was pretty light (panty liner) I broke out on my forehead for about 4 of those months than it went away I have random cramping and Nausea along with pregnancy symptoms ( cravings , nausea bad taste, mood swings )  I also have to wear a panty liner everyday due to more discharge but it colorless and don't have a smell I haven't notice hair loss or nail damage but I do get a light period every month sometimes 5 days some times 8 and it makes my constipated /gasey sometimes I have cravings and sometimes I don't eat cause I feel bloated and full
21	328	I also had extremely bad anxiety/depression, crying fits, gnarly headaches, major cramps and severe mood swings, family hates me/it!!!!
21	329	I'm experiencing a few cramps on my left side, and I was spotting this morning, but that's all normal.
21	330	So far, continual cramps, period pain tablets ease this, 5 days in the spotting has started.
21	331	Reading all comments, it will be intersting to see if the cramps and bloating go in a couple of weeks and how long the spotting will stay - i will stick it out for a couple of months.
21	332	I would then (for the first 3 months or so) get random, painful cramps.
21	333	The procedure ended up being way more painful than I'd been prepared for, then I had 3 days of unbearable cramps (I could barely move).
21	334	About another 3-4 weeks of increasingly less severe cramps.
21	335	I've had it for three years I still get horrible cramps and periods.
21	336	Currently having some spotting and cramps but nothing I can't handle.
21	337	Afterwards though, I have had minimal mild cramps and barely any spotting and have gotten on with life.
21	338	The cramps were so bad I couldn't walk but that only went on for a week.
21	339	After that no more cramps and everything went back to normal .
21	340	I have been dealing with severe cramps and heavy flow ever since getting my period at 9 years old.
21	341	2 months after inserting mirena I no longer have cramps or period at all.
21	342	I got the mirena in November 2015 and on February 23, 2016 I had horrible double over in pain type pain and cramps.
21	343	In August 2015, almost 3 years of no periods, no negative side effects at all, I started having severe cramps.
21	344	The initial cramping was the worst part of it, but the cramps subsided after about 5 days and were manageable with Motrin.
21	345	However the procedure was standard it hurt like anything during insertion but no worst than cramps.
21	346	I had pretty intense cramps off and on for about two months.
21	347	All I felt was the cramps afterward.
21	348	I rarely have periods & when I do I just spot a little (I used to have very heavy periods & BAD cramps).
21	349	Severe cramps immediately and for two weeks after.
21	350	The cramps and bleeding remained for 25 days before I went to the emergency room and begged for it to be removed!!!
21	351	The cramps were endless and the left side pain had me doubled over.
21	352	I never have suffered from bad cramps and continue the same (except 1 night having extreme discomfort.)
21	353	The pain varies from person to person so I can't say it won't be painful, mine just felt like period cramps and then some mild pains after as if they were normal cramps but not terrible; no mood swings.
21	354	I had terrible and heavy periods, bad cramps, passing out, missing 1-2 days of work bimonthly, heavy flow.
21	355	I am now 3 months out and only have 1-2 days of very light bleeding/minor cramps, no weight gain or general discomfort, I'm hoping to end up with no periods at all.
21	356	I even had a huge blood clot come out of me but the cramps were tolerable.
21	357	I had bad period style cramps the rest of the day and took it easy but was up and moving like normal the next day.
21	358	The cramping I'll admit was quite painful not as bad as my normal cramps.
21	359	Then monthlyish I got a light period and cramps.
21	360	This month I have been bleeding for almost 10 days now with cramps.
21	361	Some of the cramps are mild and some make me double over.
21	362	I would guess3-4 cramps every hour that last about 30 seconds each.
21	363	No pain, no cramps, the only bleeding I've had has been spotting and that happens maybe once a year.
21	364	I do get headaches, cramps and sore breasts when I ovulate but that is it.
21	365	After my child was born I bled for months non-stop and cramps were unbearable.
21	366	I had my 4th child 7months ago and just started getting really bad cramps.
21	367	Now after having it for 4 months I occasionally get some random cramps and some times some mild cramps after sex but my period is super light now and I like that part.
21	368	( Nausea, Vomiting, Mood Swings, Weight Gain, 0 sex drive, Abdominal cramps) This is insane I talked to my Doctor as I was vomiting w/nausea for three days off and on.
21	369	The insertion was a lot more painful than I expected and I had bad cramps for a couple days afterward.
21	370	Ocasional cramps since.
21	371	After that I took more ibuprofen and it felt a lot better as the day went on I had more and more pain, felt dizzy and had horrible cramps and couldn't sleep from how bad it was!
21	372	For the first 2 months I would have really bad cramps sporadically throughout the day but now I don't at all.
21	373	The Mirena itself was great, I had no issues or side effects, after the first two months I no longer got a period, but I would still experience the cramps and breast soreness.
21	374	Afterwards, I felt like I had bad period cramps.
21	375	Very bad cramps like stabbing.
21	376	I experienced terrible cramps EVERY day for the first 8 months.
21	377	No cramps, No mood swings, and best of all I don't get pregnant!
21	378	I used to have the worst periods, the ones with cramps that had you on the floor.
21	379	After that however, the cramps stopped and so did my period.
21	380	The whole thing took about 10 minutes and really didn't hurt, I give credit to the meds, I got some cramps once they hit my cervix and some after.
21	381	I had bad cramps and spotting for two weeks and that stopped.
21	382	The stomach cramps I had during the 'panic attacks' felt like I was being stabbed in the stomach and resulted in vaginal bleeding.
21	383	I had severe cramps for a few hours after it was inserted, but after that they were mild for the rest of the day (and the next).
21	384	Besides a few mild cramps (not even as painful as the ones I have on my period) and a very mild headache, I have not experienced any pain or side effects so far.
21	385	The pain during the placement wasn't bad, some cramps for maybe a minute (but I also have a child).
21	386	The surgery was just a quick pinch that gave u normal menstrual cramps during/ afterwards.
21	387	My first period after insertion was much heavier and I had cramps (one particular tough day) but spotting ever since.
21	388	I have gained a lot of weight specially on my legs and I do get a lot of cramps sometimes.
21	389	I was on the 2nd day of my period when I got it inserted and when I went in it was fairly heavy and I had really bad cramps.
21	390	I have yet to have an actual period, but have spotted / bled enough every day since the insertion, with more painful cramps (daily) that I had previously on a regular.
21	391	I had really bad cramps, fever and I was puking which was not fun at all.
21	392	Because when they  pinch your cervix to put it in it feels like really bad cramps.
21	393	After I got it heading home I had bad cramps my symptom's lasted for about a week and a half which sucked I had all the symptoms of pregnancy you could say.
21	394	I've always had a heavy flow along with horrible cramps so the only difference now is a little bit lighter and constant spotting every single day.
21	395	I had normal cramps for few days, no bleeding.
21	396	Since then my cramps came
21	397	I have minimal spotting occasionally and maybe a morning of cramps once a month.
21	398	I still PMS, get cramps, and have spotting around the time I would be having my period but not anything like how it was naturally.
21	399	I just had minor cramps but overall it was a good choice.
21	400	previously on pills and they were driving me mad and not working (severe headaches and cramps) so I decided to try the coil, afterall if it doesnt work I can get it removed.
21	401	The first week was fine, I did end up with severe cramps but my doctor booked me in for a scan and checked it was fine which it was and we just put the cramps down to my body adjusting to the coil.
21	402	I got mirena in and it did hurt but only for a split second, I don't even remember the pain now, I had cramps instantly but they only last a couple hours, I had no spotting or bleeding,(most likely because I was also covered with my drop shot).
21	403	I still experience cramps every day but it's not unbearable.
21	404	Insertion is weird but it does feel similar to monthly cramps.
21	405	3 days later & I'm still having random bad cramps.
21	406	I had mine put in yesterday and yes it hurt really bad unlike anything I have ever felt and I have still have cramps but my doctor told me they would last a month and should stop but I could bleed lightly or irregular for 3-6 months I suggest talking to your doctor about it and it's different for everyone so just remember that  just because it hurt for me it may not for you and wish you all the luck and hope you have a good experience
21	407	I experienced some bleeding and severe cramps with rectal pain and pressure for 9 days.
21	408	I got mirena in on Monday 6-22-2015 and it's thursday now and these cramps on my left side are killing me .
21	409	I had light spotting for the rest of the day and some mild cramps that felt better when I laid down and used a heating pad.
21	410	No cramps I've been able to work from 5 am to 130 go to the gym, go shopping, and play with my baby without fatigue.
21	411	Still sitting here with awful cramps and the urge to pass out.
21	412	If you have awful cramps during your period I do not suggest getting this inserted and leaving right away after.
21	413	Previously I would get cramps so bad from my period I would be bed ridden.
21	414	I had dealt with horrible cramps every month for my entire life, until Mirena.
21	415	It is a blessing to not have cramps and to not have a period but maybe 3 times a year.
21	416	I've been thinking about getting it removed due to my husband being frustrated with my low drive, but to have those horrible cramps again makes me cringe.
21	417	The insertion was quick but slightly painful, the cramps started right after and were really bad for the first week.
21	418	After I got cramps every day just during the late afternoon for some reason.
21	419	The cramps stopped about a week ago.
21	420	I haven't had a period in about 8 months but occasionally do get cramps.
21	421	I had this birth control for 3 years now and it was processe and painless .. i barely get periods and cramps.
21	422	I rarely had cramps before I got it,  but since then I get pretty bad ones every few months.
21	423	I had paraguard for four years and experienced very bad cramps during ovulation and my period, along with heavy bleeding.
21	424	I still have no children and found the insertion of the Mirena to be no worse than two bad cramps, each lasting only a second.
21	425	Three rather severe cramps - but nothing worse than I have had with a particularly bad period.
21	426	I have been so moody, cramps awful cramps, low sex drive my poor husband, breast swelling and tenderness again, cysts on both ovaries, hair loss, depression.
21	427	The insertion was very uncomfortable for me and still have mild cramps, but I can say me and my fiance have a piece of mind that I won't be getting pregnant anytime soon, although we do want another.
21	428	It's now 4 hours after and no cramps.
21	429	My periods did not become lighter, my cramps did not get less painful.
21	430	I started my period 3 days ago and the cramps were excruciating.
21	431	I am someone that got extreme cramps before, and my cramping was bad first three months I spotted and cramped and hated it!
21	432	It's not severe pain, but bad cramps that don't go away, even with advil.
21	433	My cramps are bad only when I spot (only happens once in a while) I'm not saying they are comfy, but are better than before I was ever on a birth control tabs, I believe that I have actually lost weight, not due to mirena, but due to work, etc.
21	434	I had no cramping after the procedure but  cramps later that night, similar to a bad period which I am used to.
21	435	Mild cramps every now and then for the rest of the week.
21	436	I do have cramps sometimes.
21	437	1st week I had no spotting but cramps every day.
21	438	Now going into week 5 no bleeding but am still getting cramps every day.
21	439	For the first 2 week I lived in track pants as I couldn’t wear anything tight because it would bring on the cramps.
21	440	It's worry free - also stopped my horrible cramps I used to have and my recurring ovarian cysts.
21	441	I was on paragard for a year because of the no hormones,but I couldn't deal with the pain.The cramps were unbareable,and my periods lasted 7  days and were so heavy,Id have to use a super tampon PLUS a large pad .I switched to mirena, hearing the pain was a lot less & could shorten periods.
21	442	The awful cramps started right after i got up.
21	443	I bled like a regular period for 3 days and the cramps were the worst I've had in my life.
21	444	No more cramps.
21	445	I will though if I'm on a antibiotics , then it tends to mess with my mirena and I'll get cramps and will spot.
21	446	Everything seemed to even out for the next week, other than random cramps and spotting.
21	447	There was no pain but I was cramps all the next day as my doctor indicated when he recommended it to me.
21	448	Manageable cramps and light spotting followed the appointment.
21	449	Saturday, some cramps, hardly any spotting.
21	450	I'm had it since October and I've recently started having really bad cramps.
21	451	I came on my period three days ago and had terrible cramps.
21	452	I'm 20 with a 2 month old and it was uncomfortable when I got it inserted, & I had cramps and bleeding for the first day.
21	453	It has been 2 weeks since I got the Mirena and I am still getting cramps, have been bleeding for 2 weeks, get mild headaches, fatigue, lower back pain.
21	454	I've been cramping on and off since insertion, and honestly some of those cramps were worse than the actual insertion!
21	455	OK so pretty much a few days out of each month I would spot very light, no cramps.
21	456	Barely any cramps.
21	457	Horrible cramps for the first 5 or so hours after insertion (had to drive home) and almost couldn't take it.
21	458	The cramps went away the next day!
21	459	A few cramps here and there, but that's expected.
21	460	Little cramps but it all want away.
21	461	I feel like the people who say that they had a painful insertion are only the ones who have either never had a baby or never had cramps.
21	462	I suffered from really bad menstrual cramps and severe mood swings.
21	463	My cramps have disappeared.
21	464	I had Mirena inserted 5 months ago and am still having very heavy periods with horrible cramps.
21	465	I used to get cramps so terribly painful that at 24 years old, I was begging my doctors to approve a hysterectomy.
21	466	During my usual menstruation I get horrible cramps that will even cause me to vomit, but during the procedure the pain wasn't even close to that.
21	467	I only cramped for about two weeks after, and those were very mild, but I don't have a history of cramps either.
21	468	Insertion was about eequivalent pain to getting a tattoo but shorter (only lasted 30 seconds) and cramps after lasted a few hours.
21	469	I used to suffer from extremely heavy periods with cramps and sickness that meant I had to take a minimum of half a day off work a month.
21	470	I had menstrual cramps for an hour and that was it.
21	471	The first 6 weeks I had cramps and spotting.
21	472	No cramps.
21	473	Right after insertion I felt great, no pain for a few hours, then the cramps began.
21	474	Nonstop terrible cramps with a little bleeding, for 3 full days.
21	475	The cramps finally subsided but then the stabbing pain started.
21	476	Had quite bad cramps afterwards and light spotting but not too bad.
21	477	And amazingly pain free (used to get bad cramps).
21	478	I had awful cramps for a week after I got it.
21	479	I get cramps here and there but again it's only been a week my boyfriend says he only feels the strings but it doesn't bother it only tickles, so far so good.
21	480	Getting it put in I had minor pain, no worse than normal menstrual cramps.
21	481	I hardly spot, the cramps come around during the time of the month, but they are not nearly as terrible as they were before Mirena.
21	482	I felt a tremendous amount of cramping when she dilated me and afterwords I had the worst cramps for about 2 Hours before the pain reliever kicked it.
21	483	I have struggled for 25 years with painful cramps and excessive bleeding and Mirena is the only thing that has worked for me.
21	484	If you follow direction & take Advil or Ibuprofen every 4-6 starting 1 hour prior insert & 5 days post same routine that will rid of cramps & bleeding.
21	485	VERY satisfied- no cramps or bleeding!
21	486	Slight pain during the insertion, nothing worse than cramps.
21	487	I still get pretty bad cramps accompanied with it too.
21	488	I didn't notice any major problems at first, but by year two I thought there was something medically wrong with me (I have been seeing a specialist, my normal Dr. couldn't figure out what was wrong with me) I had really emotional PMS, the sharpest worst cramps (I could feel the Mirena poking me for the inside) and no sex drive at all.
21	489	Haven't had a period yet, but still have occasional cramps.
21	490	The first night was uncomfortable, but I woke up the next day feeling much better and now I barely have any cramps at all.
21	491	I've had pain and cramps since on and off.
21	492	She has had severe cramps for years.
21	493	There will be a feeling of having pms cramps for awhile afterwards, so a heating pad + Aleve has been my best friends, and it is really manageable.
21	494	All I've experience is a bit of cramps and some back pain.
21	495	No period, and only minor cramps when I exercised vigorously.
21	496	I did experience some occasional cramps, especially the first couple days after insertion (For Your Information insertion pain was minimal).
21	497	My description of it is this ... to start with it feels just like a smear, then slight stomach cramps (not as bad as my usual period pains) then another bit of cramping then done.
21	498	During insertion, the pain was horrible and I had cramps the rest of the day.
21	499	They usually aren't continuous cramps, in and out something like a spasm.
21	500	During the insertion I had 2 small cramps that did not last long.
21	501	Now it's been about 3 months since the procedure and I have not had any bleeding but I do get lots of cramps and I am having a hard time losing weight.
21	502	The insertion wasn't very painful, though the cramps afterward were a little uncomfortable (nothing that some ibuprofen can't fix).
21	503	However my sex drive was very low and I experienced minor contractions (that's what I call them) they were more intense than cramps, nothing that a couple of Motrin couldn't handle.
21	504	Yes the insertion is uncomfortable, but only for a minute or so, just a couple of cramps.
21	505	I experienced a few of the most intense cramps I've ever had, but they were bearable.
21	506	Also, I went back to working out the following day with no cramps or anything.
21	507	The next 12 hours I had the worst cramps of my life!
21	508	My period went away no cramps it is great.
21	509	But began having few cramps after I work out and break out a lot, that I can't tolerate any anymore.
21	510	It was pretty easy, I had minor cramps after.
21	511	Since the age of 13, my periods were agonizing; migraines, vomiting, diarrhea, back & leg cramps & was going through tampons, etc., like crazy!
21	512	Both felt like bad period cramps, more uncomfortable than painful.
21	513	I've had mild cramps throughout the day, nothing Ibuprofen can't fix.
21	514	The insertion process was quite painful, and I had cramps the rest of the day.
21	515	I had bad cramps for about a week and period for almost a month.
21	516	Since then, I have some spotting as well as cramps.
21	517	No monthly cramps, it took a while before they became almost non-existent (maybe 1 year), no mood swings.
21	518	I started having cramps, backaches, nausea, headaches...
21	519	I'm really excited about light periods and minor cramps.
21	520	I used to suffer from heavy bleeding and cramps that felt like a kick in the gut.
21	521	I had cramps and spotting for two weeks afterwards.
21	522	I was constantly bleeding I was losing so much hair, had really bad cramps and I was always so tired.
21	523	I have no periods, maybe one really light one every 8 months, I do have breast tenderness and sometimes minor cramps.
21	524	So since I got the Mirena I've been so happy I don't bleed as much and I don't have really bad cramps and migraines anymore so yes I would recommend this to anyone.
21	525	What I love the most is not having to remember to take pills, bad cramps, and buying tampons or pads especially with a teenager in the house.
21	526	I no longer get cramps or periods.
21	527	About a month after having it placed I started having terrible cramps, mood swings, low sex drive, very dry during sex, I've gained about 30 pounds since I got it.
21	528	My period usually lasts about 3 or 4 days and is very light, but that doesn't make up for the horrible cramps.
21	529	I did have some side effects (fatigue, dizziness, cramps, spotting) the first 2 days after having Mirena inserted but by day 3 I felt 100% better.
21	530	During the week that my period is normally due I feel slightly bloated and more hungry then usual but it sure beats 10 - 12 days of heavy bleeding, severe cramps, nausea and vomiting.
21	531	Since then my periods have become progressively lighter and shorter (now they only last for one day, and bleeding is so light that I rarely use pads or tampons), and I never get cramps.
21	532	After it stopped, I didn't bleed at all for 2 1/2 months until now and its very light, but heavy cramps.
21	533	Add a constant sense of bloating, cramps and back pain.
21	534	I have never had children and it gives me light manageable periods, no more cramps, and I lost weight.
21	535	Although I should mention I am one of those women who rarely gets cramps and I had normal periods.
21	536	I have not had a period since 1 month after insertion, no headaches or cramps.
21	537	I had cramps for about one hour after the insertion and haven't had anything since.
21	538	Next day mild cramps.
21	539	The first day was uncomfortable, it felt like really bed menses cramps, but since then I haven't even felt it.
21	540	I did have some cramps and bleeding on and off for the first 3 months and got a bit bloated due to water retention but after 6 months everything was fine.
21	541	I had cramps for a few days but a heat pillow solved that.
21	542	I have not had many cramps but I have been bleeding off and on for the past 6 weeks.
21	543	The rest of the day I was drowsy but had no cramps, headache or normal "period pains".
21	544	I had little cramps during insertion and light bleeding but that was it.
21	545	The procedure feels like a pap smear + 3 intense cramps (nothing worse than bad period cramps).
21	546	I have now stopped getting my period all together but I experience just 1 PMS symptom when I'd normally have my period-- not cramps or moodiness, just sore breasts.
21	547	The day I had it put in I had bad cramps for the rest of the day and after that I was fine.
21	548	I used to have horrible cramps, throwing up, headaches and pass out from my period, but with the Mirena I have had minor cramps during my period and a tiny bit of bleeding.
21	549	Getting the Mirena inserted wasn't any worse than period cramps, and very quick.
21	550	Afterwards I had very slight cramping (didn't even need to take pain killers) and spotting for 3-4 days, then everything went back to normal - no cramps, no spotting.
21	551	No cramps, no bleeding.
21	552	I had a few days of cramps and bleeding in the begining.
21	553	I had minor cramps for about a week and a half before it disappeared altogether, and I had light spotting here and there but nothing a panty liner couldn't fix.
21	554	Insertion was slightly painful but overall had few cramps that day.
21	555	Insertion was slighly uncomfortable, but no worse than a large period cramp, spotting for about a week after that was intense along with cramps, but nothing that is unbearable (especially when you consider one week compared to 5 years of cramps) and I am now into my 2nd month.
21	556	Since it had stopped I've had BAD cramps.
21	557	I had cramps for at least 4 hours afterwards once the medicine kicked in.
21	558	I have had minor cramps ever since the insertion, but not bad.
21	559	I had been in two car accidents and happened to be taking a heavy duty muscle relaxant- Thank goodness, because the cramps were something terrible, and according to my sister, she said they were the equivalent of contractions.
21	560	This didn't say I didn't have cramps too.
21	561	I had mild cramps for two days-  After that no cramps, no headache, no period, no weight gain, nothing.
21	562	I have a tilted uterus and always had back pain and cramps.
21	563	ex: cramps, cravings, increased appetite... which led to a light weight gain but like 5-7 lbs nothing I can't get back under control.
21	564	Anyway, the insertion was not that bad at all, little bit of cramps and discomfort but that was it.
21	565	I still get minor menstrual cramps though.
21	566	However, after the insertion I had the worst cramps ever.
21	567	I'm still experiencing cramps.
21	568	My periods have gone from ~5 days down to 1, and no cramps!
21	569	Two hours later all I have is mild cramps.
21	570	I feel cramps every once in a while.
21	571	I USED to have very, very heavy periods and very painful cramps.
21	572	What I am having difficulty with is are the horrible cramps I am still having four days later.
21	573	I want this to work and it to have a positive experience but this is worse than cramps before.
21	574	I've experienced heavy bleeding and mild cramps that feel like contractions in my lower stomach and back.
21	575	I luckily had taken two days off so I rested and I did have painful cramps.
21	576	My periods are already lighter and my cramps are much more manageable.
21	577	I would highly suggest asking for something for the pain if you have not had kids, get bad cramps anyway and are planning on getting this placed.
21	578	Every once in while I will get random cramps on the one side where I always got really, really bad cramps.
21	579	When it comes to that time of the month I get really bad cramps and bloating but no spotting.
21	580	I usually have heavy periods and pretty mild cramps.
21	581	Today, I've barely spotted at at all, and the cramps have definitely decreased.
21	582	Some cramps and minor bleeding in the beginning as expected, no complaints, no side effects, my sex drive is way up (which I very much like) and was not the case when I was using the pill.
21	583	Mild cramps for about 30 mins.
21	584	I've been bloating and have had constipation and gas for 6/10 days, also cramps.
21	585	The cramps lasted about a week and I bleed for around 4-5 weeks then it stopped BUT around a 3 months later I started bleeding again and I bleed all the time.
21	586	I am happy with the way I don't and haven't had a period since the insertion and my cramps are nothing like the ones I got during every period.
21	587	Since then I been having mild cramps and breakthrough spotting but I wouldn't trade it for none.
21	588	Insertion was a little painful just a few minor cramps then I was fine right after.
21	589	2 minor cramps and it was over.
21	590	In the first few hours, I experienced menstrual-like cramps.
21	591	I think it's a good option and I hope the cramps go away!
21	592	I had my Mirena inserted in March 2011 had cramps the first week and was nauseous here and there for the first couple of months.
21	593	I love not having periods and am terrified of going back to bad cramps, but I believe that switching my method of birth control is the best thing I can do.
21	594	I didn't get any cramps after like my doctor said.
21	595	I have really subtle cramps right now, but not enough to even take a Tylenol/Advil.
21	596	I was crampy for about an hour afterwards but after about an hour the most unrelenting cramps started and I was in so much pain I was sweating and had palpitations.
21	597	Two doses of 50 mg tramadol later (roughly 8 hrs after getting it inserted) the cramps disappeared and I have only had very mild twinges a couple of times today.
21	598	I have had mirena for 6 months, insertion was not painful just a slight pinch feeling, had a continuous period with severe cramps for 3 weeks after with worse cramps than ever before.
21	599	I have had weight gain, spotting and bleeding for weeks at a time, headaches, severe lower back pain and cramps that feel like contractions for the last 4 months or so.
21	600	The side effects have gotten better, still with bad cramps and weight gain, have not had a period in about 2 months.
21	601	The first 3 months were AWFUL--I spotted and had terrible cramps the entire time, and I was extremely irritable.
21	602	3 years later, I rarely menstruate and never get cramps!
21	603	When I got the Mirena placed it hurt for like 30 seconds and then I had really bad cramps for about an hour.
21	604	I cramped most of the day but after that no cramps.
21	605	Although sometimes I get cramps I think that it is the most effective use of birth control and my doctors were very open and willing to discuss all the side effects.
21	606	I get bad cramps and a headache before my period.
21	607	I would suggest to take Advil or ibuprophen before the procedure for cramps.
21	608	I had more cramps that night, but it didn't last long.
21	609	The procedure lasted about 3 and 1/2 minutes then the pain lessened to intense period cramps.
21	610	After placement I had moderate period-like cramps for about 12-24 hours (nothing bad, just noticeable).
21	611	My cramps remained for the rest of the day.
21	612	While the insertion went smoothly, I had terrible cramps for the next month.
21	613	My periods got much worse (I never had heavy bleeding or cramps during my period).
21	614	The rest of that day I had mild cramps, no worse than the average menstrual cramps.
21	615	No other cramps or symptoms at all.
21	616	I rarely had cramps before insertion however now I usually have 1 day of TERRIBLE cramps (which subside only with 800mg Advil).
21	617	It felt like 2 really bad, but quick cramps.
21	618	The cramps after insertion agent too pleasant, nothing that pain killers can't help.
21	619	I am 23 and have never had children, and the insertion pain was not too bad, actually better than my normal cramps.
21	620	Going in, it was a little uncomfortable, like a pinching feeling, had cramps for the rest of the afternoon and then I was fine.
21	621	No cramps or dizziness or anything.
21	622	I do get some occasional spotting, but my periods are very light and there's no horrid cramps like I had when I was on the pill before I got pregnant.
21	623	I want to tell the girls out there that its ok and if you can handle menstrual cramps you can handle the Mirena.
21	624	When I first got it put in, it really hurt and I had the bad cramps for a day or too.
21	625	The insertion was easy, it felt like cramps.
21	626	I still got cramps every few months, but never needed to take anything.
21	627	Had some uncomfortable cramps and used a heating pad at bed time.
21	628	I had some cramps for the first two weeks, probably due to getting used to the hormones in the IUS.
21	629	I do however have painful cramps that come and go, headaches, weight gain, lack of energy, and the Mirena is causing polycystic ovarian syndrome.
21	630	I had severe cramps and pains for about 2 weeks after I got it put in.
21	631	There were two MAJOR cramps.
21	632	I had a few cramps the following days, some bleeding, and black gritty discharge.
21	633	So far I've had a few cramps every few days and spotting.
21	634	Since I've had it in I have had almost unbearable cramps, headache, and became very dizzy.
21	635	I have been bleeding ever since they inserted it and the cramps and stomach pains hurts way to bad.
21	636	My period's are light and I don't have the severe cramps that I had before.
21	637	I get serious stomach cramps and migraines before each period now.
21	638	Just a few cramps when he was putting it in.
21	639	I bled and had minimal cramps that day and nothing since.
21	640	After the insertion, I had mild cramps for the remainder of the day.
21	641	I must say it was not painful for me, and I have extremely mild cramps if any, don't let these negative reviews scare you!
21	642	It was a little painful and I had some cramps the first day but after that it was great and have been great for the past 3 1/2 years!
21	643	Also the debilitating cramps, that used to be so painful my doctor actually prescribed a prescription strength Aleve (naproxen), no longer exsist.
21	644	I began having stomach cramps, nausea on most days, painful breasts and diminished libido and when it was supposed to be that time of the month my abdomen would bloat.
21	645	Still at this point I am not having any problems or cramps that would make me uncomfortable.
21	646	I was throwing up for over five hours from the pain cramps I got.
21	647	Now I'm feeling like menstrual cramps and a little bleeding but all of this is better than having another baby now.
21	648	Currently I keep getting cramps in my lower abdomen, which I have never had before.
21	649	Insertion was not very painful for me (not hardly as bad as the pain from menstrual cramps that I'd endured for 10 years).
21	650	Since I got the Mirena last year I lost weight, no more cramps, lightened periods, and a better sex drive (probably because I don't have to worry if I'm going to get pregnant), I feel safe.
21	651	The rest of the day I had fairly strong cramps but nothing unbearable.
21	652	Afterward, minor cramps just that day.
21	653	I had fairly regular periods that lasted about a week everytime, maybe 2-3 days of heavier bleeding, and next to no cramps.
21	654	The insertion was very painful, and I've had mild cramps.
21	655	Since placement, I still have irregular bleeding, cramps, horrible dizziness, headaches, moodiness, and have gained weight.
21	656	I understand this is different for everyone but my cramps were pretty severe.
21	657	Now I rarely cramp and the periods are very light so I can't really complain.
21	658	I was 18 and never had a baby, so when she clamped my cervix it felt like a horrible cramp and a sharp pain.
21	659	I cramp on and off all the time.
21	660	Each sharp pain was followed by what felt like a strong period cramp.
21	661	I had it inserted on last month 15 sept. Was painful during the insertion, experienced cramp for a short while.
21	662	It only took about 3 minutes to put in, and it just felt like the strongest cramp I've ever gotten.
21	663	My periods are have still come but they are super light and last about 3 days, they are also sporadic but I don't blame it too much since before my periods used to last 7 days and were sporadic anyways.I have little to no cramping and when I do cramp it lasts about 3 days and usually the 3 days I lightly bleed.
21	664	Everyone has different bodies along with different symptoms I went in an my doctor told me my uterus was tilted and I was going to feel a sharp pain which I did it felt like a huge cramp and it took the breath out of me but that's the only reason why it hurt that much was because my uterus was tilted other wise it wouldn't have been that sharp.
21	665	Had it placed May 2015, minimal pain - a pinch and a menstrual-type cramp, and it was done!
21	666	Insertion was slightly painful; it felt like a bad cramp for a few seconds.
21	667	And I didn't even cramp.
21	668	Honestly it just felt like a deep cramp.
21	669	The procedure itself was quite painful but not unbearable it felt like a bad cramp and a pinch.
21	670	Every time I cramp I expel a puddle of blood and it even pools in the toilet when I pee.
21	671	It was a deep cramp with very specific pressure.
21	672	I've had mild cramping and slight bleeding throughout the day, but its nothing as bad as a regular period cramp.
21	673	If anything, they feel less then a period cramp.
21	674	I had a mild cramp or two when it was inserted, and some light bleeding, but  Other than that it was no more uncomfortable than a pap test.
21	675	Literally had one cramp during insertion.
21	676	The initial procedure for me was not bad at all, and the pain was less than a normal period cramp.
21	677	Worst cramp I've ever had and that lasted all day.
21	678	For the first year my periods were irregular and I would cramp up even during times when I wasn't on my period.
21	679	It wasn't pain but pressure and like a very strong cramp.
21	680	I had the mirena put in four days ago, having it inserted was painful, like a heavy cramp that lasted for a minute.
21	681	I didn't take any medicine since I didn't have any on me but I did experience a terrible cramp feeling when I had it inserted.
21	682	Covered 100% Insertion felt like a bad period cramp.
21	683	I did cramp pretty bad afterwards but only after I had it done.
21	684	I spot all the time to and cramp on and off.
21	685	I felt some intense cramping and a couple of pinches of pain, but it the pain spread into just a bad cramp.
21	686	I'm 23, with no children and never cramp, which probably had a lot to do with the pain.
21	687	The procedure was uncomfortable but felt no worse than a bad cramp.
21	688	I did not think it was painful at all - just like an intense cramp for about 10 seconds, but I think everyone has a different body and a different pain tolerance.
21	689	It felt like a quick cramp and then it was all over with.
21	690	Not going to lie - the pain was truly horrible upon insertion, and I did cramp for weeks afterwards, but after that cleared up 5 years of no periods changed my life.
21	691	1 day after insertion, and now I am completely cramp free.
21	692	Insert gave a small cramp to my surprise much easier than I was setting myself up for in my mind.
21	693	It was unlike any other painful cramp I have ever felt before, but the pain did not last for too long and after it was inserted I was fine and didn't really cramp much after.
21	694	I cramp lightly now and that's a miracle in and of itself.
21	695	As far as the insertion goes, my doctor told me there would be a pinch and then a big cramp.
21	696	When she told me the big cramp was coming she was not kidding.
21	697	I felt a deep heavy cramp for about 30 seconds.
21	698	For the next few days I would get a cramp once a day, no big deal.
21	699	Just a little bit of cramping during and after the procedure then I was cramp free.
21	700	The cramp is not as bad as I used to have when I was on period.
21	701	I didn't feel anything but a small cramp the doc said dilating the cervix is the painfully part.
21	702	Occasionally after sex, I will cramp for a few seconds but nothing serious.
21	703	I felt pretty bad for the rest of the day and cramped for the next few with a bit of VERY light spotting, but I haven't had any spotting in the last week and just have the occasional cramp.
21	704	But I cramp pretty often still, but at my checkup the doctor told me if I could just make it through the first 6 months I would be good to go.
21	705	The insertion was painful, but after I left the doctors office I did not cramp.
21	706	When I do have a period, I do cramp, but usually no longer than a day or two.
21	707	Just a big pinching/burning cramp for about 3 seconds and that was it!
21	708	I have never given birth but I would imagine it was like labor pains...not your typical period cramp...and it was all day every day.
21	709	Insertion was no worse than a bad period cramp (again, I've never had kids and it didn't hurt that bad) and I spotted for a few days.
21	710	I have had strange tight cramping when the weather gets colder that lasts a couple of minutes to an hour and lower back pain with every cramp.
21	711	Putting it in really didn't hurt much for me, just felt like a bad period cramp.
21	712	However, it was just a mild cramp, and it was over.
21	713	The doctor kept telling me that I might feel a cramp.... nothing but a tiny pinch.
21	714	The first cramp was for the measurement of the uterus, the second was for insertion.
21	715	I go in for my check up in 2 days and they may have to remove it because I'm bleeding non stop, cramp everyday off and on to the point I cry and medicines wont take them way.
21	716	I had the Mirena IUD inserted this morning and I felt nothing but a very light barely there cramp and that was the end of it.
21	717	Insertion was not bad, felt like a quick hard cramp for a minute then had a little cramping and spotting for the next day.
21	718	All I felt was a little pinch followed by what felt like a pretty moderate menstrual cramp.
21	719	The most I felt was a minor cramp (This is not pain ladies!)
21	720	I would say worse than a period cramp.
21	721	Feels like a severe period cramp.
21	722	I was on the 3rd day of my period and for me the insertion hurt like a couple of pinches and a really bad cramp that gave me all hot and made me nauseous.
21	723	Since then I have had very minor spotting with an odd little cramp here and there.
21	724	I was on my period, light cramp during insertion.
21	725	I've read so many stories about the excruciating pain women have felt during insertion, but for me it was no worse than a period cramp and it didn't last very long at all.
21	726	Afterwards the cramping did get a lot worse but subsided after a few hours.
21	727	Yes inserting it was like 3 seconds of hell if you’ve never had a child before and it caused a month-long monster period and 3 moths of excessive cramping, but almost 3 years down the road now, it’s easily one of the best decisions I ever made.
21	728	I just got Mirena & no pain during procedure, no cramping after, barely a brown tinge in clear mucous after...heavenly!
21	729	I did, however, have pretty painful cramping for four hours about after 30 minutes after Mirena was inserted on September 27th.
21	730	It felt like intense cramping for maybe a minute then it's over.
21	731	My Mirena caused severe cramping 4 days a week, an inflamed cervix, and caused weight gain.
21	732	Insertion & initial cramping were pretty bad but thats normal.
21	733	The side effects were okay initially with the cramping.
21	734	I used to suffer from extremely heavy periods and cramping that interfered with my daily life.
21	735	I had my Mirena in for only a month- I seemed to be adjusting fine with normal spotting 3 weeks after, cramping only the first 42 hours it was in (until my next period came) BUT I happened to go to the eye Dr. Where they diagnosed me with early stages of papilledimia, or swelling of the optic nerves due to excess cerebral spinal fluid built up in my brain.
21	736	As for me, cramping, bloating and back pain are still there, although not as strong.
21	737	My skin has always been oily so I can't blame it for that and I haven't experienced cramping, my ex said he could feel it but I think it was just because I had it inserted partway into our relationship and he was paranoid because my current boyfriend says he doesn't notice anything abnormal.
21	738	After the procedure I had some cramping and a brown discharge for the rest of the day.
21	739	During the insertion I bearly had any cramping and it only lasted for about 5 minutes.
21	740	In the weeks following I had minor cramping.
21	741	The pain was about 4/10, but I wouldn’t even consider it pain, uncomfortable may be a better word (sharp cramping but bearable) My period is already much lighter than usual to the point that I’m only wearing panty liners (I never had very heavy periods previously and I’ve been on the pill for about 5 years)
21	742	The insertion was a breeze I didn't feel much, I just had light cramping during the procedure.
21	743	There was some pretty bad cramping after it was first inserted for maybe 10 minutes.
21	744	Severe cramping for 6 months like I was in labour, daily bleeding for 12 months, fatigue, lactating breasts after 12 months and now pregnant.
21	745	Insertion sucked but it wasn't unbearable, I had severe cramping after insertion.
21	746	I had a very light period for first three months and occasional cramping but no worse than before I had the mirena inserted, after that I've had 4 and a half years period/cramp free.
21	747	Honestly, it was a bit uncomfortable, definitely the first 5 minutes or so after, 800 mg of ibuprofen and there is no more pain or acheyness... it wasn't that bad, no bleeding, cramping subsided 3 hrs later.
21	748	The insertion for me was very very painful, the doctor had to dilate my cervix so it made the cramping even worse, the pain was so bad that I was actually sick.
21	749	However I'm still experiencing bad cramping days later.
21	750	I won't say at the moment if I hate it or not as it's been only a couple of days but i hope the cramping stops soon!
21	751	I found the pain of insertion was not unlike some of the cramping I usually experience during my period, except it was one big one versus twenty minutes of painful contractions.
21	752	Following the procedure, I had very mild cramping.
21	753	I am now on my period and my flow has already seemed to have lightened and my cramping is less severe.
21	754	I never had severe cramping or heavy bleeding during my period and after insertion I stopped getting periods.
21	755	No pain, no cramping and no bleeding.
21	756	I spotted for about two days with very little cramping.
21	757	Mild cramping and some spotting after.
21	758	I had almost no spotting the first month and then had a much lighter than normal period with almost no cramping.
21	759	I use to have very heavy periods with a lot of cramping.
21	760	The past month I have had no real period and no cramping, but I am spotting pretty much every day.
21	761	No period, a day of spotting every 6 months or so, no cramping, no horrible side effects.
21	762	I bled a little the first day and had mild cramping.
21	763	I've had Mirena for exactly 6 days and I'm still experiencing minor cramping.
21	764	I've gotten used to the cramping but if it gets too annoying I just pop a Motrin.
21	765	Didn't hurt and no cramping.
21	766	No cramping.
21	767	I would advise everyone to take a good pain pill bc the pressure and cramping is pretty heavy.
21	768	What was more annoying was cramping the rest of the day and the next day.
21	769	I have a desk job so I was really aware of all of the cramping.
21	770	If I had a job where I had to move around a lot I don't think I would have noticed the cramping.
21	771	For about a week after insertion, I experienced light to moderate cramping but now (a few months later), I experience no cramping and no period.
21	772	Mild cramping and spotting after the procedure but nothing a little naproxen couldn't fix.
21	773	I know some people find the insertion very painful, but I felt very low pain, only mild cramping when they put it into place, which was a huge relief as I was very nervous about the pain.
21	774	But you still feel it...feels like the most painful cramping, you can ever imagine.
21	775	( my periods didn't last long maybe 2 to 4 days, but the cramping was unbarable but the actual flow was light.)
21	776	So far zero bleeding, zero cramping or discomfort.
21	777	Severe cramping lasted for 2-3 days, I was not able to stand up straight due to pain.
21	778	I've had the mirena IUD in for two weeks..I end up with severe cramping every day and every day is worse.. About a month ago I started losing weight because I've been working out 5 days a week for an hour.. Now since the last two weeks I've gained weight..
21	779	Moderate to severe cramping the first couple of days but have since subsided.
21	780	During the procedure I had insane cramping right away and I felt like I was going to be sick from both ends at any minute.
21	781	At first it was bleeding and cramping for a month straight.
21	782	Insertion and cramping not that bad and everything was great up until my first period came about two weeks after insertion (this is where the strange symptom came into play).
21	783	On top of bad cramping and heavy bleeding, I had terrible colon and rectal spasms (Sorry for the TMI).
21	784	Lately I have been experiencing severe cramping which I can only describe as almost feeling like contractions when you're about to give birth.
21	785	Following the procedure, a friend took me home because of the cramping it caused but after a couple hours I felt okay to drive.
21	786	So I wasn't walking much that week anyway, and then my first two cycles (months) with the mirena the cramping was so bad it felt like I was being sawn in half with a chainsaw (no joke) but no blood or spotting whatsoever .. 5 months down the track.. no pain at all and no spotting and has been like that for the past 3 months.. reason for not giving mirena a perfect 10 is because I've definitely noticed extra hair growth.. but nothing tweezers can't fix.. but it is noticeable to me
21	787	My period before Mirena was 9 days, set to a stopwatch, heavy, with cramping that made me vomit and pass out for several hours on a 28 day cycle.
21	788	So far, no cramping, slight spotting.
21	789	It only lasted about 30 seconds and felt like light cramping.
21	790	I have had very heavy periods and cramping since I was 11.
21	791	I had intense cramping and heavy and often irregular bleeding for a while, the irregular bleeding and spotting last for over 6 months.
21	792	Last night I started feeling cramping, like I was dreaming and could feel them in my dreams.
21	793	Having had no children it's painful but after a day or two of cramping I'm back to myself again.
21	794	The insertion was not terrible it was kind of like long papsmere with some cramping along with it.
21	795	Experienced mild cramping afterwards and spotted for the next several days.
21	796	On top of this is hair lose, bigger appetite, irritability, cramping, and fatigue.
21	797	The insertion of Mirena was quite painful for the first 10-15 minutes afterward (though not as bad as my excruciating normal period pain), but then it settled down to mild cramping.
21	798	But other than that and some very mild cramping at first, my life has changed.
21	799	Afterward I had terrible cramping for about 2 weeks, along with bleeding.
21	800	My doctor said the cramping was due the fact that my uterus was so small because I have never had any children, so I was just getting used to it being there.
21	801	The cramping has since went away ( It is over a month later ) but I am still bleeding, it is way less than a period, not clotty either.
21	802	Cramping and spotting for the rest of the day, and occasional cramping for the following week.
21	803	Had cramping, painful breasts an irregular bleeding for weeks but I wanted to tough it out.
21	804	I am very sensitive so the insertion was painful (lots of cramping and spotting after).
21	805	The first time I had no problems very little cramping, very light to no bleeding.
21	806	I have slight cramping but light periods and sometimes heavy.
21	807	Since then, I've had no real periods but a lot of unpredictable spotting and light bleeding, as well as cramping, that lasts for upwards of 3 weeks on end, sometimes with only one week in between.
21	808	There was some pressure, a slight pinch followed by a little cramping but the pain was very mild.
21	809	My doctor said that light spotting and cramping is expected for about 6 months but I haven't experienced any if that.
21	810	There was a lot of bloating, cramping,  and breast tenderness in the first couple of weeks.
21	811	The first month was a study in misery but after that my periods stopped and it's been a breeze with some occasional light cramping and spotting.
21	812	At first the cramping was odd and painful, nothing I couldn't handle, it would happen sporadically and would subside after a few minutes.
21	813	Constant most horrific cramping...
21	814	I still have horrible cramping and mps.
21	815	I considered getting it removed but I've heard symptoms of bleeding & cramping can last week's even months.
21	816	I gave it time & after around 3 weeks the cramping had stopped.
21	817	As I hear my reaction to cramping was normal!
21	818	All the cramping I get from this thing.
21	819	I got the mirena placed last Friday and it was excruciatingly painful and I have been bleeding heavily and cramping since.
21	820	Ever since then I have periodic cramping throughout the day.
21	821	I have had three kids and had the mirena put in a few days ago, no pain at all with the doctor putting it in , had some bleeding the same day and it has stopped since, but there is some cramping and bloating hopefully it will go away after the 3 months.
21	822	The side effects I feel is lower sex drive, gained 10lbs, and it was painful to insert with mild cramping.
21	823	Once inserted within 2 weeks the bleeding and cramping ceased to exist!!
21	824	Getting the mirena only caused mild cramping for a couple hours when it was inserted.
21	825	After a few days I still had pain but not as much but oh my goodness my first period with it inserted was the worst, really bad cramping and I bled for like 3 weeks.
21	826	No cramping or bleeding, I was one happy mommy!
21	827	Intense cramping and killer headaches.
21	828	It's now day 3, n cramping and only spotting when I wipe.
21	829	I took ibuprofen and wore lose clothes after it was in the cramping has been on and off but not unbearable so it was pretty easy
21	830	Severe cramping afterwards, eased after a few days.
21	831	The severe cramping lasted for a few weeks...I have been bleeding non stop for the past 4 months.
21	832	The initial process was okay, there was a little bit of cramping, but nothing major I took two Advil and the pain was gone.
21	833	I experienced mild cramping.
21	834	Off and on that first week,  i took ibuprofen for the cramping.
21	835	Just slightly cramping during the  procedure!
21	836	That being said I feel like it would have been better if my doc would have told me that it would hurt worse than just "mild cramping" and I would have taken a better painkiller other than the 200mg of Advil she suggested.
21	837	The cramping was very mild.
21	838	Had it put in yesterday and I'm experiencing NO cramping whatsoever.
21	839	I have had headaches that won't quit , terrible mood swings (I can go from happy to sad in seconds ) I can't seem to shake off all my pregnancy weight, I'm bloated , dealing with Insomnia, I don't have interest in sex (which is awful because I'm married) I feel like a completely different person, cramping and spotting -which isn't too bad.
21	840	The first one didn't hurt at all when they placed it but the second one I had pretty bad cramping for about a half hour.
21	841	I get headaches like everyday, along with cramping.
21	842	It's been 4 weeks now and I've felt like its a constant period - cramping, bleeding and I am a total psycho too - I've asked to have it removed.
21	843	I'm cramping, mildly, and bleeding (which is normal when something is inserted in you) I definitely recommend this to anyone, and if you're scared, don't be.
21	844	Occasionally I get sharp cramping that last 5-10minutes.
21	845	I get brutal cramping almost 24/7, intercourse is painful for me if my husband thrusts too deep, I get intensely nauseous during my period and my period is VERY heavy, I recently got Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, and the cords can still be felt by my husband both the day before and the day after my period.
21	846	The cramping continued for a couple days.
21	847	There was a little cramping but nothing unbearable.
21	848	It was only about 5 minutes of intense cramping but it wasn't awful.
21	849	Again, only spotted and slight cramping for one day.
21	850	I never had cramping before and now I do, I I won't stop bleeding and my stomach is so bloated even though I'm eating healthy everyday.
21	851	I had almost no cramping or bleeding (probably due to just stopping Depo) and it has been great so far.
21	852	I felt an ever so slight cramping for 2 hours afterwards (maybe because I was very aware of it and looking for some symptom) and then haven't felt anything since that time yesterday.
21	853	It's been 6 hours since my appointment, I have no bleeding and just a little cramping.
21	854	After insertion  had mild cramping for two days and light to moderate spotting/Brown discgarge since insertion.
21	855	Felt like mild cramping I felt like passing out only bc I stopped breathing from being nervous.
21	856	It's been about 6 hours & I am having mild cramping.
21	857	Doctor warned me that I will feel a pinch and cramping but I didn't feel a thing at all.
21	858	I had very light cramping for a few days and my periods became sporadic for a few months.
21	859	The "pain" could be described as mild cramping at best.
21	860	I haven't had any weight gain, no crazy hormones, no cramping, and best of all no spotting or periods since day 1.
21	861	The pain was quite awful for about 5 seconds, then I had a bit of cramping, followed by some sweating, all of which subsided rather quickly.
21	862	I had slight cramping and have had light/bleeding since.
21	863	I still get the slight cramping as if I am going to start my cycle but no blood and no major pain from it.
21	864	I have had mild cramping and just spotting not even enough to wear a pantie liner.
21	865	Bad cramping, bleeding for a month straight.
21	866	The insertion was uncomfortable, and i had some cramping that day but nothing you cant handle!
21	867	I had no cramping, no menstrual cycle, and no "bad" side effects.
21	868	I had cramping,  just as if I was on my period for a day or 2.
21	869	My doctor told me I would experience some cramping during the procedure so that didn't sound like big deal.
21	870	The mirena did hurt when I got it put in and did have bad cramping and some spotting but it was no unbearable.
21	871	Had my period for over a month with heavy bleeding and cramping.
21	872	The pain & cramping for the first 2 days after made it impossible to move & now a week later I still have bad discomfort & spotting.
21	873	I can say that I still have cramping but it is not NEAR as bad as what it was.
21	874	No cramping, a small spotting and thats it!
21	875	But after insertion I had cramping and mild bleeding for 2 days.
21	876	I had no cramping or spotting after the procedure and have still have no cramping or spotting.

21	879	I had some cramping and bleeding nothing bad tho.

21	881	Full on gushing, bad cramping, I feel light headed, sick, my heart is fluttering and racing, I feel altogether terrible.
21	882	I felt a little prick and had some cramping for the first hour.
21	883	I have some cramping every once in a while.
21	884	After the insertion, I didn't have any cramping or bleeding for abt 4 days.
21	885	I'm starting to have cramping now.
21	886	The pain ended immediately after but the next two weeks felt like having a very bad period with cramping and slight bleeding on and off.
21	887	Sure it was uncomfortable and bad cramping but it only lasted a few minutes.
21	888	After 2 days of horrible cramping it went away.
21	889	Hoping the cramping goes away soon.
21	890	Getting it in was more painful than I expected and I had fairly intense cramping for about twelve hours afterward.
21	891	I have now been bleeding for over two weeks and have had a lot of cramping.
21	892	I got the Mirena in a month ago the procedure didn't hurt at all.The first two weeks the only problem I had was dizziness.About a week ago I started bleeding and have not stopped and I am cramping very very bad.
21	893	In the past when I had periods I had massive amounts of cramping & insanely grumpy.
21	894	The only side effects I had was occasional bloating and cramping.
21	895	I had a bit of bleeding and cramping in the two days following.
21	896	I had some minor cramping during the sounding process and again during the insertion process but it was all more uncomfortable than painful.
21	897	It does hurt to get in, a lot of cramping and pinching, but it only last for a few moments and is totally worth it in my book.
21	898	Yesterday( the second day I had it) my bleeding stopped by the end of the day and I had no cramping.
21	899	Today so far no spotting, although that wouldn't worry me, and ive also had no cramping or pain of any kind anywhere.
21	900	The insertion was very painful and I had some cramping for few days, then nothing.
21	901	It felt like intense and sharp cramping.
21	902	Unfortunately, the evening after having it inserted my cramping was very intense.
21	903	I didn't have any cramping today until this evening but it's not nearly as bad as the first day.
21	904	The insertion itself hurt a lot, but the cramping that came afterwards was absolutely excruciating.
21	905	Two days later I have slight cramping (I've been taking vimovo) and very light bleeding.
21	906	The insertion was rather painful - I got all hot and watery mouthed, thought I was going to throw up, the cramping and spotting lasted about a week.
21	907	I have period like cramping all of the time.
21	908	There was some minor cramping afterwards, but I am noticing that I am struggling with losing weight.
21	909	I had major cramping and bleeding for the rest of the day.
21	910	Today I only have mild cramping and some spotting.
21	911	I experienced bad cramping with insertion because I have not had a child, but it was nothing I haven't felt before.
21	912	I had some mild cramping throughout that day, but afterwards none.
21	913	I still have fairly regular periods--every month, light bleeding with a little bit of cramping.
21	914	Only downside is that on rare occasions, I do experience cramping after heavy exercise.
21	915	I felt pretty much normal walking or of the building, no cramping.
21	916	I have had one period so far right on time, lasted a solid 5  days will no cramping and I've been spotting ever since.
21	917	It's been about three days, and so far I have had light cramping about 3 times a day and spotting.
21	918	I had some minor cramping for the first day or two, but no bleeding.
21	919	.. also some cramping after sex on occasion
21	920	Also, the cramping was not bad at all.
21	921	I did not feel any pain or cramping when the doctor inserted Mirena.
21	922	I experienced some cramping when it was inserted and a few days after.
21	923	Post removal, I had very minor cramping, but nothing that required medication.
21	924	Insertion didn't hurt, just a little cramping.
21	925	Now on my 4th day with the Mirena and I still have light cramping and spotting is now turning into regular bleeding.
21	926	Bad bad cramping for the rest of the day- I would take Panadol before going in next time so that it was kicking in earlier.
21	927	The insertion was quick but very painful, after it was over I laid down for ten minutes and I was ready to go, some cramping but nothing an Advil can't fix.
21	928	I did bleed heavily for the first 2 months during my period and spotting too, and cramping bad.
21	929	Especially the after effect, for the rest of the day I was cramping so bad I could barely stand up and not cry.
21	930	I also had to constantly take more pain reliever the rest of the week due to more cramping.
21	931	It was semi-painful to insert, I felt cramping for a couple hours, and very tired all day long but woke up the next morning and felt almost 100% normal!
21	932	The cramping and expected bleeding/spotting stopped after about a week and I literally have noticed no side effects since.
21	933	After I left the doctors I experienced slight cramping and have continued too off and on for about a week now.
21	934	The only side effects was the barely mild cramping for a day afterwards.
21	935	After I experienced light cramping for about a day.
21	936	The pain during insertion was high and I had horrible cramping for the next few days.
21	937	I have had no side effects, cramping, nothing!
21	938	I had cramping for two days and spotting for less than a month.
21	939	I had horrible cramping the day it was put in.
21	940	No cramping so far and very little spotting.
21	941	After that, just some cramping for the rest of the day and light spotting.
21	942	I had some pretty intense cramping, had to take really deep breaths, and remember it is only going to last a few seconds.
21	943	I just had the Mirena inserted and although there were about two 30second moments of intense cramping it wasn't that painful at all.
21	944	I had initial spotting when i first got it put in and pretty bad cramping for a week, which was expected.
21	945	I am feeling fine and cramping less than when I am on my period.
21	946	I have had it for a little over two years and no longer have any bleeding or cramping from periods.
21	947	I haven't had a baby before so my doctor gave me something to dilate my cervix, I took a Tylenol extra strength thirty minutes before, and the insertion felt only like bad cramping.
21	948	I am having at little more cramping with this one that I didn't experience with the first one.
21	949	It just felt like very minor cramping for about a minute.
21	950	After insertion, there was mild to moderate cramping but went away with ibuprofen.
21	951	I knew going into it that the Mirena device was going to hurt, but being that I have a very high pain tolerance and have gotten used to lots of uterine pain (I've had really heavy periods accompanied by intense cramping since I was nine), I really didn't think it would be all that bad.
21	952	I did not experience any of the severe cramping or pain after getting it placed, due to the fact I had mine placed after a procedure.
21	953	Cons: a little cramping and nausea in the first few months, a little weight gain in the beginning, but I lost it easily, painful when first inserted.
21	954	It was a little uncomfortable and accompanied by mild cramping afterwards and for the next few days.
21	955	There's no heavy bleeding and I barely have any cramping if any at all.
21	956	Having it inserted hurt like hell but only for a few seconds and then I had a good 2 months of on and off cramping but its been a year and a half and so far and I love it.
21	957	I got right up and continued on the cramping, started instantly and was pretty intense, so I took something for it and called it a day early.
21	958	I haven't had any other symptoms besides cramping.
21	959	I rarely cramped before so this cramping to me is intense.
21	960	However, since I have had Mirena (4 months) I have had heavy cramping (like if I stand up I get lightheaded and the pain is almost unbearable) and unpredictable periods with light to really, really heavy bleeding.
21	961	My doctor has done over 1,000 and the whole thing took less than 2 min and caused little to no cramping!
21	962	I still have some cramping, but nothing compared to before the insertion.
21	963	I had absolutely no stomach cramping after a couple of hours after it was put in, but you must take about 5 Aleve before and after.
21	964	I have had A LOT of cramping, even in my legs.
21	965	When it was all done I had no cramping and no bleeding for a year.
21	966	This time I had a little more cramping during the procedure.
21	967	Afterwards I bled heavy for 10 days with mild cramping.
21	968	I had some cramping for a few days, as well as spotting, after 6 months, my period stopped completely.
21	969	Very little bleeding, a little more intense cramping, but Advil took care of it.
21	970	I experienced a lot of cramping pain during the dilation and insertion of the procedure and also 2 days after the procedure.
21	971	I love the Mirena now and no longer have a menstrual cycle or cramping.
21	972	The cramping started at this time.
21	973	I had minimal spotting and cramping after.
21	974	And for the last almost 5 years I have very little cramping, no periods, no mood swings and pain with intercourse only 2 or 3 times.
21	975	The procedure was not painful but afterwards I had some cramping, but nothing I couldn't deal with.
21	976	I have always had really heavy periods, accompanied by intense cramping.
21	977	I've had it for almost 11 months, I have not had any complications only down part about it would be the cramping in the begging but it goes away after a while.
21	978	I spotted the whole time I had it in, experienced more headaches, lower back aches and cramping.
21	979	I almost fainted while leaving, the entire day I had severe cramping.
21	980	I've had it 2 weeks now and I still have the cramping, some days worse then others I really hope it stops.
21	981	Insertion was just a little pinch and cramping for a whole day.
21	982	I took 800mg of Ibuprofen an hour prior to the procedure and did not experience cramping of any sort afterwards.
21	983	I have had 3 children so I felt no pain during insertion but mild cramping after insertion that lasted the rest of the evening that I cured with Aleve.
21	984	Having it placed was not bad; no cramping or bleeding, and my periods stopped completely.
21	985	When I was getting my Mirena inserted it hurt a little & after that I had cramping.
21	986	I had my period on & off & a lot of cramping.
21	987	Finally I decided to get it, the insertion was not painful at all ( maybe because I had just giving birth) I did feel a little bit of cramping that day and the following, but nothing major.
21	988	I've had slight occasional cramping and rare bleeding that's very light and only lasts a few hours when it does occur.
21	989	I have had no problems since it's insertion aside from terrible cramping for about a half hour while my cervix adjusted to it once it was put in.
21	990	Slight cramping after the procedure.
21	991	The only side effect I have had was cramping the first few months when I had the first one placed.
21	992	Beware that there will be some bleeding and cramping after its placed because they have to open your cervix.
21	993	Took Advil for the next 24 hours for mild cramping.
21	994	A little cramping about a day after but that was it.
21	995	I had minor cramping and bleeding when it was implanted.
21	996	The first time around, I was spotting and cramping for 4 months.
21	997	No mood swings, no more cramping, great birth control (10 years and not a single pregnancy or even a scare!)
21	998	I had the 1 day of light bleeding after insertion and light cramping.
21	999	Not having a period or cramping has been awesome!
21	1000	I have always been blessed with super light cycles lasting maybe 3 days with no cramping, bloating things of that nature and even now I don't have one at all just a little spotting randomly.
21	1001	Acne, tired, bloated, nausea, cramping, headaches.
21	1002	not too painful at all, and no cramping like my dr. said I would experience.
21	1003	I have had no cramping, no soreness or discomfort.
21	1004	No spotting, or cramping since the input.
21	1005	I do get bad cramping once in awhile in that region especially if I lay in certain positions for a long period of time.
21	1006	I had cramping for a few hours after and that was it.
21	1007	Afterwards little cramping but nothing major.
21	1008	I experienced the normal, cramping and extreme discomfort and pain immediately after placement.
21	1009	My cramping and pain lasted longer than normal.
21	1010	I went from having a 3-4 day period with one day of cramping to a week and a half period with 5-6 days of cramping.
21	1011	I experienced significant cramping for a few hours after it was put in, but a heat pad and a day of rest was enough to keep it very bearable.
21	1012	I am tired of cramping all the time, because at times it's so bad I feel like curling up in a ball and sleeping all day.
21	1013	I do have some mild (very mild) cramping with the beginning of each period.
21	1014	Also I bled heavily for three months immediately after I got it with lots of cramping.
21	1015	The insertion was a little painful since my uterus was "untouched" by pregnancy but after a few hours of cramping, I was good to go.
21	1016	I do get occasional cramping but nothing serious.
21	1017	The insertion did not hurt at all as well as not having the normal cramping and spotting after insertion.
21	1018	I had cramping for about 3 days afterwards but nothing major.
21	1019	When the doctors say "mild" cramping, they are NOT speaking for everyone.
21	1020	The insertion was incredibly painful, honestly the worst pain that I have ever felt in my life, and I experienced cramping for the rest of the day.
21	1021	All that happened was I felt very mild, barely noticeable cramping that day, and on and off randomly since.
21	1022	No spotting, not much cramping, totally worth it.
21	1023	I spotted for the 1st couple of months along with cramping.
21	1024	Day 3... No spotting or cramping.
21	1025	I had a lot of cramping after but nothing that some Aleve couldn't handle.
21	1026	A little bit of cramping that was it.
21	1027	Eventually by the fourth week I only dealt with bouts of cramping.
21	1028	At first I experienced cramping and bleeding for about 3 months, then it regulated and I haven't had a period for over a year now.
21	1029	Most prominently, I have always had severe cramping since inserting it (never before was cramping an issue for me).
21	1030	I had really intense cramping after insertion that lasted for a full day.
21	1031	For the first 3 weeks I had heavy bleeding and cramping after 6 months of having the Mirena I have not had a period which is nice but I have headache and gained about 20 pounds.
21	1032	I had cramping, but because of the ibuprofen I fell asleep as soon as I got home.
21	1033	I'm not going to lie it hurt, had a lot of cramping.
21	1034	The next day mild cramping.
21	1035	I spotted slightly for the first few weeks and had some pretty intense lower abdominal cramping if I wore tight pants that would only last for a few seconds.
21	1036	I have had a heavy period since, constant mood swings, feeling depressed, short of breath, tired, loss of sex drive (somewhat) it's just not as good because I feel dry, and a constant cramping that almost makes me want to get sick .
21	1037	I have always had really bad cramping and nausea during my period, and getting the Mirena felt like the first and the worst day of my period.
21	1038	I had some cramping for about an hour afterward, but some Ibuprofen and a heating pad knocked that out in no time.
21	1039	I had it put in after my son was born in 2004 and I didn't feel a thing when they put it in, I've never had cramping or mood swings, nor have I had any weight gain.
21	1040	Painless insertion, little cramping throughout the day, spot after intercourse for the following 3 months.
21	1041	My period is very slight and no cramping.
21	1042	Afterwards, no cramping, hardly any bleeding.
21	1043	Afterwards I had pretty intense cramping for the rest of the day, I would make sure you have nothing to do afterwards because it really helped my cramping to be able to just lay down and relax the rest of the day.
21	1044	The second day I had some mild cramping, but nothing too bad and the third day I was almost back to normal.
21	1045	I had some cramping after the insertion but took two OTC pain relievers and haven't felt anything since.
21	1046	I had 2 days of light cramping (Just take some ibuprofen) but I was able to go right back to school on Monday.
21	1047	However, I do have bloating, painful cramping every few weeks, and I've just started having some back pain which I think may be connected.
21	1048	Spotting stopped after about 3 months, but for the past 4 months it has started up again and some days I will have severe cramping about the same levels as I used to experience with my cycle.
21	1049	I had cramping after insertion but I took Motrin and it stopped within 15 minutes.
21	1050	The insertion was painful but after an hour I felt fine other than mild cramping.
21	1051	Very very little cramping almost unnoticeable and very little bleeding, just a drop or two.
21	1052	After that it went away and everything was fine with the exception of some minor cramping here and there.
21	1053	I got it on my last day of my period and so far some mild bleeding and cramping, but way better than going through another labor.
21	1054	But now I get severe cramping like 2 times per week.
21	1055	There was a little cramping when it was put in and during that day.
21	1056	The insertion was pretty painful (probably like an 8 out of 10) and the cramping has been bad at times, but not always.
21	1057	I had the dizziness and cramping after placement but a few hours and it was gone.
21	1058	I had nothing but migraines, backaches, bloating, severe cramping, irritability, extreme weight gain (50 lbs total) anxiety, sharp stabbing pains in my ovaries and my husband was always being poked by those strings.
21	1059	I am having some very, very mild cramping but I don't even need to take anything.
21	1060	Insertion was uncomfortable and I had cramping that could compare to mild contractions for the whole afternoon/night after.
21	1061	Still have light periods every month or two, but they are very light and all if my previous cramping is gone.
21	1062	The only side effect I had was cramping.
21	1063	Since then, I've had mild cramping and a very light period (more like spotting).
21	1064	They are worse than ever, no cramping but heavy bleeding for more than a week, every month!
21	1065	My period was 2 1/2 weeks long (which has never happened in my life) with weird discharge and a lot of cramping.
21	1066	The main issue I've had with the Mirena is a lot of cramping and brown slimy discharge.
21	1067	I have been experiencing regular bleeding everyday since it was inserted, mild cramping about once a month and moodiness/depression.
21	1068	I mean I felt no pain at all and I didn't start cramping until about 10 min.
21	1069	I was fine soon after, and experienced cramping afterwards.
21	1070	I have been having some very bad cramping on and off for the past weeks and I am having a little spotting for my period but nothing serious.
21	1071	I didn't have too much discomfort with the insertion, just some mild cramping.
21	1072	The first 6 months my period was very irregular, a lot of spotting but not heavy and now it's more regular and has remained light which is nice, no cramping.
21	1073	I felt mild cramping during insertion but I haven't felt a thing since.
21	1074	I had cramping and bleeding for a month, which I was told was normal.
21	1075	I've had cramping off and on and usually a dull pain on my right side.
21	1076	I am recently experiencing bloating and cramping.
21	1077	Just a little cramping afterward.
21	1078	The cramping afterwards was dreadful as well.
21	1079	Slight cramping today, nothing unbearable though.
21	1080	Highly recommend requesting off work a couple days after insertion, I had to leave work the second day because of the cramping.
21	1081	Insertion was very painful, cramping afterward.
21	1082	No cramping, no bleeding, no nothing.
21	1083	I got really dizzy and nauseous right after and experienced pretty severe cramping for about the next hour.
21	1084	I did take a nap as soon as I got home and by the time I woke up, the cramping had gone down significantly.
21	1085	I only had light cramping and barely spotting for the next two weeks, and since then haven't had my period.
21	1086	In the three weeks I've had it, I have felt lots of cramping, bloating and gained three pounds.
21	1087	At first I had cramping and bleeding for the first two months, which I read is normal.
21	1088	I have had severe cramping, bloating, mood swings, little or no sex drive and frequent milky white discharge throughout the day.
21	1089	I am thinking about getting it removed very soon because the cramping has gone on for 2 weeks straight, it feels as if someone is stabbing me in the lower abdomen.
21	1090	My only complaint would be that with the Mirena you occasionally had cramping, but then again its a lot less cramping then you go through having a month period.
21	1091	I had nonstop cramping, nausea, bloating, back pain and spotting along with a weird clear discharge, slight memory loss and painful sex in certain positions.
21	1092	I just had a little cramping the week after having it put in.
21	1093	It is nice not worrying about getting pregnant but after getting it put in at my 6 week post pardom appointment I had a lot of cramping and spotting for about a month.
21	1094	I didn't have any cramping after insertion either.
21	1095	The cramping has indeed gotten worse and I bleed at very odd times; sometimes very heavily with clotting and sometimes lightly.
21	1096	I had cramping every now and then, like sharp pinching feeling.
21	1097	I did experience cramping on and off for the rest of the day, but nothing worse than normal period cramping.
21	1098	After one particularly bad cramping episode, I went to my doctor who, after a sonogram, found that the Mirena had worked its way into the lower part of my uterus (it seemed like my body was rejecting it).
21	1099	I'm losing my hair and every once in a while I get cramping.
21	1100	After 4 months my headaches are slightly better but I have had some noticeable side effects; 10-15 lbs weight gain, increased discharge, longer periods, and cramping after sex or exercise.
21	1101	I had some cramping, very little spotting the day of but I have not had a period since insertion.
21	1102	I had some spotting that day and moderate cramping for a few days after, but just took some ibuprofen and it was bearable.
21	1103	A week ago, I had very very light spotting for about 5 days, I just wore a panty liner and it was fine, no cramping or anything either.
21	1104	No periods, little cramping, no weight gain.
21	1105	Sometimes I get a sharp pain, cramping and nausea.
21	1106	I had no periods, spotting or cramping.
21	1107	As soon as my periods stopped, the cramping started almost every day.
21	1108	I've been having some light cramping and spotting and a little dizziness right after leaving the doctor's office but nothing to bad.
21	1109	The insertion of Mirena was pretty painful I must say, and the cramping hours afterwords was terrible.
21	1110	But after that all the cramping went away and now I can't even tell that I have it.
21	1111	I haven't had my period since getting the Mirena but I have had symptoms as if my period is coming like tenderness of the breast spotting and discharge and cramping but NO PERIOD.
21	1112	I've had the Mirena now for 2 weeks and so far do not feel any bad symptoms other than light headaches, spotting and cramping that comes and goes.
21	1113	The insertion was extremely painful for me both times, with severe cramping for hours afterwards, but totally worth it.
21	1114	I have a little cramping still, but not bad at all, and its usually only when there's pressure on my abdomen, like when I'm working out or need to have a bowel movement.
21	1115	I also had more intense cramping and mood swings.
21	1116	My sex drive has improved, I haven't had a period, only slight and occasional cramping.
21	1117	I have no sex drive at all, I'm dry during sex , intercourse is painful, throughout these 6 months I still feel lots of cramping in my uterus, worse then a period, my back hurts, and such mood swings I can't control.
21	1118	The insertion was uncomfortable and some cramping throughout the day.
21	1119	I did not have any cramping probably because my doctor recommended that I take a pain killer an hour before the procedure.
21	1120	Heavy cramping and bleeding that entire night and next day.
21	1121	I had some spotting, and slight cramping for weeks after so I went back to the gyno to have a follow up to make sure it was in right, they said it was.
21	1122	7 months into having this until now I have experienced some intense cramping, and a couple of months I have had spotting at the beginning of the month and at the end.
21	1123	I experienced moderate cramping for a few days after and just took it easy for a while.
21	1124	I've had a little cramping off and on and some spotting, but that's it.
21	1125	I had horrible cramping and at the end I was in so much pain.
21	1126	Insertion was  fine, slight cramping for a couple of hours then slight cramping off and on for the next couple of days but nothing major at all.
21	1127	Anyhow, I didn't have any cramping or anything afterwards, and my period's already stopped.
21	1128	The insertion wasn't bad just had cramping after wards.
21	1129	Sometimes I do experience some cramping when I bend over a certain way and its sharp and very painful.
21	1130	It was very painful when it was inserted,then had cramping for the rest of that day!
21	1131	It's been 4 days and I still have a little cramping but overall HAPPY.
21	1132	I have had some minimal cramping in my lower back today but, not enough to amount to anything.
21	1133	My sex drive is in tact, but I have had some light cramping and minor headaches (nothing too bad, I haven't even had to take pain killers).
21	1134	I have had the cramping off and on, weight gain and my stomach has been bloated up like I am pregnant.
21	1135	It was more a pap smear than an insertion and then they trim the strings, it was so simple and I didn't feel no cramping or spotting.
21	1136	Yes, insertion was terribly painful (and I'm a tough cookie), after a few hours of cramping, my ibuprofen did the job and I felt better.
21	1137	I did suffer some cramping for a few days after and had light spotting for about 2 months.
21	1138	I had slight cramping after but nothing bad at all.
21	1139	I have severe cramping, horrible migraines the week before I start and the 5 days I'm on my cycle, I also have extremely crazy mood swings.
21	1140	I had cramping for a day and after that my first months period was 1 day.
21	1141	I had cramping for the first couple weeks, for the first 6-8 months I had regular periods around the end of each month.
21	1142	Year 2- spotted all the time, irregular bleeding, cramping when I'd lay down, woke up nauseous, from day 1 husband felt the IUD, but we managed.
21	1143	I was getting shorter lighter periods, cramping was normal.
21	1144	Since then I have only had cramping and have been taking it easy.
21	1145	I felt dizzy and nauseous for the first hour after and relatively bad cramping for three hours.
21	1146	Had some very light cramping for two weeks and now nothing, not even my period.
21	1147	Here is my last 13 months: Mild cramping with insertion.
21	1148	Insertion was a breeze next to no cramping.
21	1149	It was like having really bad cramping for the the remainder of that day.
21	1150	I had serious cramping for the rest of that whole day.
21	1151	I had lots of cramping and spotting for the first six weeks, and since I'm very sensitive, it made me a bit moody too.
21	1152	But I was given Percocet and after about 35-40 min it started to ease my cramping, along with a heating pad.
21	1153	I've only had some cramping in the last couple of days and spotting is occurring here and there.
21	1154	I am still having on and off cramping, and I'm spotting, so hopefully it will work out once my body gets used to it.
21	1155	Today (day 2) I am cramping, but nothing that a few ibuprofen couldn't handle.
21	1156	The following 2 days I experienced some cramping.
21	1157	I have been on it for a year and love it , but I did have the bad cramping after I got it, that's the only bad thing.
21	1158	There was some strong cramping during placement, and that was it!
21	1159	It was painless and I had no cramping in the days to follow.
21	1160	Cramping after wards was only slightly more than past period cramping.
21	1161	Slight cramping, but that's to be expected.
21	1162	I had some bad cramping for a week or so and non-stop bleeding for nearly a full month.
21	1163	I've also had a little discomfort with sex (only recently) I have also notice that when I should be bleeding, I only get cramping.
21	1164	I haven't had any pain, just occasional cramping which I'm assuming is because of my menstrual cycle even though I don't have periods.
21	1165	I had some minor cramping and bleeding for a couple weeks.
21	1166	Some side effects I had were headaches, severe cramping, pain in my sides, moderate to severe bleeding, horrible mood swings.
21	1167	I had cramping that day pretty badly, then it went away by the second day.
21	1168	It has been 2 days and I'm much better, just light cramping.
21	1169	When I had it placed I had some moderate to severe cramping but I was given pain killers to help that.
21	1170	For the 1st year I had some random cramping but no periods, but now I hardly think about it (unless my friends are complaining about theirs).
21	1171	I had slight cramping the first day or two and since then my periods have disappeared, I haven't had a period in 6 months, no monthly symptoms either.
21	1172	Also, I have had cramping and they are getting worse to the point when it does happen I need to stop what I am doing.
21	1173	While it was slightly uncomfortable and I did feel some cramping during the insertion I have not had any discomfort since.
21	1174	When I first got it put in I only bled for about a week with a little cramping.
21	1175	It's light, no cramping, no headache, nothing.
21	1176	In addition with no periods, there was no cost for pads/tampons or pain medication for cramping.
21	1177	There was a little cramping but I've had worse cramping during my period than having this inserted.
21	1178	No cramping, mood swings, PMS, heavy bleeding, not to mention all the dollars saved on NOT buying outrageously expensive tampons and pads.
21	1179	I have not had a period (not even any spotting or cramping) yet and I am SUPER happy with that.
21	1180	The first 24 hours of cramping was not pleasant.
21	1181	It only lasted for a few hours and cramping for a couple of days.
21	1182	Other than some slight cramping during and some moderately worse cramping later that day and for a few days after (nothing pain killers can't handle) it's been great!
21	1183	Aside from the abhorrent cramping that happened for about 6 hours after it was putin, I have no periods, no cramping, no bloating, no mood swings..nothing!
21	1184	It was a crampy feeling after and I bled a little then it stopped.
21	1185	It is now the morning after and I have had no spotting or bleeding and don't even feel crampy at all!
21	1186	After a few months I still felt really crampy but I held out hope that it would subside.
21	1187	I was crampy and had normal period bleeds for about 2 weeks and thought what have I gotten myself into.
21	1188	I did feel crampy for the rest of the day, but I returned to work and even went to the gym and did a 2 mile run on the treadmill.
21	1189	I think I want to get it taken out soon because I'm also feeling real crampy throughout the day.
21	1190	I would just like to say that yes the Mirena hurt when it was put in for like a minute, then I felt a bit sick after and then crampy for the rest of the day, gradually getting better (I've not had childbirth!)
21	1191	It went smoothly and I was very crampy afterwards, but 2 hours later I was totally normal.
21	1192	The first two or three weeks were very "crampy" for me.
21	1193	But, the crampy feeling went away.
21	1194	I got mine inserted surgically and was crampy for first week, but besides from that I'm extremely happy with the outcome.
21	1195	The day I got it in I was crampy and sore.
21	1196	Really crampy!
21	1197	I occasionally get crampy and my stomach hurts, but not often.
21	1198	At the beginning of this year I started spotting and my GP advised I needed the Mirena changed.
21	1199	I had light spotting for 2 days, then my period came a week later as scheduled on October 5th.
21	1200	I had no bleeding or spotting.
21	1201	I also wake up with low back pain occasionally, and I did have spotting for several months the first year pretty much every week for many months.
21	1202	I bled quite a bit the day I got it put in and I had very light spotting the next day.
21	1203	After 6 month I kept spotting randomly, finally 8 month into it decide to take it out, come to find out my uterus was inflamed and reject it and that why I was bleeding too much.
21	1204	I have been spotting very lightly since.
21	1205	I've never once had the slightest concern about being pregnant, and have experienced no side effects besides a few days of spotting after the insertion.
21	1206	Since the insertion, I have not had more than one consecutive week without any kind of spotting or bleeding.
21	1207	Insertion was easy ( I had just had a baby) I spotted for about a month off and on but after that I would have light spotting for a day so light a pad or tampon would have been no use.
21	1208	Otherwise I have had no spotting or bleeding.
21	1209	It was always just light spotting.
21	1210	However I have not had a period or spotting in 2 years.
21	1211	Also, I ended up getting my period more frequently, for longer periods, as well as had spotting in between periods for the entire 2 years of having my IUD I got it removed.
21	1212	I have had some mild spotting, but nothing a panty liner can't handle.
21	1213	My periods stopped only little spotting which was brill as I had heavy periods before.
21	1214	I've also had random spotting but usually only when I wipe and only for a max of one day.
21	1215	I had light period like bleeding for a week followed by two days of spotting.
21	1216	It's been a month now and I'm still spotting so don't be surprised ladies.
21	1217	It does make intimacy issues due to the spotting.
21	1218	My periods use to be really heavy and now I'm just spotting which is brill..
21	1219	My first Mirena was agony to get in, 6 months of spotting then wonderful after that.
21	1220	Unfortunately, I have had spotting every day since.
21	1221	Since then, I've had some spotting, but no other side effects.
21	1222	The spotting only lasted for a day and a half.
21	1223	I have spotting on and off but not a big deal.
21	1224	While I admit it was mildly painful for the first 24 hours and the spotting lasted 1-2 months, I am now 3 years in, and couldn't be happier.
21	1225	I still have the spotting nearly everyday but it's not terrible.
21	1226	Still have a little spotting but I use a menstural cup normally so it doesn't really bother me.
21	1227	There was light spotting for the first 2 weeks, but no spotting since (now 1.5 years in).
21	1228	First 3 months I had continuous spotting.
21	1229	Became spotting.
21	1230	I am spotting brown, but that's normal after insertion..for the 1st couple weeks.
21	1231	I've had my period for 2 months at a time with some light spotting in between.
21	1232	I had light spotting for 2-3 days after.
21	1233	My periods mostly stopped basically was spotting for a day or two after year 1.
21	1234	I've experience mood swings, lack of energy, spotting after intercourse, lack of sex drive, no periods (good thing), and regardless of clean eating/exercising, I could not loose weight.
21	1235	It's been most of the day  and I'm barely spotting.
21	1236	I had spotting each month in the beginning.
21	1237	Now I have no spotting, no discharge.
21	1238	There was spotting for a month and slowed down to the point I now spot maybee 2 days a month.
21	1239	My spotting from the Depo even lifted.
21	1240	Then I tried the NuvaRing- that worked for about 3 months then the spotting started again.
21	1241	Has helped so much, very light periods now, some spotting.
21	1242	In between has been spotting or nothing.
21	1243	I had light spotting for a couple of days and haven't had my period or any period related symptoms since.
21	1244	I have had some light spotting on and off since insertion 2 months ago but that's a small price to pay.
21	1245	), and lots of spotting / discharge.
21	1246	No pregnancy worries and virtually no periods at all (once a month I get the menstrual symptoms and maybe a little spotting for a day or two but not the heavy 6-8 day periods that I used to have to endure).
21	1247	I experienced a lot of spotting for the first month on Mirena.
21	1248	My periods ended up being very regular, (26 day cycles) with spotting for 7 days every cycle.
21	1249	I experience very minor spotting.
21	1250	Was ok in the very beginning and has since maintained it's contraceptive purpose, but spotting began again and never stopped resulting in having to use panty liners daily and dealing with it irritating the skin.
21	1251	Initially had some spotting then periods ended.
21	1252	As other users have said, the spotting on and off for the first 4-6 months can be annoying.
21	1253	I bleed for 10 days 1st 3 months & had consent spotting.
21	1254	BUT after a year, the string has softened, my face has cleared up, my hair is growing back (I've always had fine hair) and I haven't had any spotting or issues in over 8 months!
21	1255	I have been having major spotting and some shooting pains.
21	1256	I do not like the spotting or pain.
21	1257	The only annoying thing about the Mirena was the horrible spotting I dealt with for the first 2-3 months.
21	1258	In January of 15' I started spotting almost everyday of that month.
21	1259	I experienced a little bit of spotting for the first few weeks, but never a full period.
21	1260	I had spotting and bleeding for a while afterwards.
21	1261	I had light spotting for two weeks after insertion and then when I thought my body was adjusting, I would spot throughout the following months.
21	1262	It wasn't until month 6 that the spotting stopped.
21	1263	No periods and minimal spotting.
21	1264	By Sept it seemed to finally settle into a 3.5 week cycle but bleeding would be heavy or have spotting for 10 days.
21	1265	It literally left me bent over after intercourse with spotting.
21	1266	No pain, no spotting!
21	1267	For the past 6 months I have been spotting (which I haven't had since before insertion?)
21	1268	The reason I chose to remove it, is that the last 6 months or so, I had much more spotting, I thought my periods would go away, but they never did, and it became highly unpredictable.
21	1269	I bled for a couple of months with the first one and have only had random spotting since (maybe every three months).
21	1270	After a month and a half I started spotting.
21	1271	It was basically spotting (slightly heavier than a pantyliner could handle), for seven days.
21	1272	Since then, I've had some sporadic light spotting, but its definitely manageable.
21	1273	They make it seem as if "spotting " is ok but after two months of constant spotting you begin to wonder- "why did I get this".
21	1274	Smelly discharge, spotting.
21	1275	I was a little worried  if the Mirena is in the correct position and the gynaecologist says every thing appears fine and my lining is thinning correctly and that I should notice the spotting will come less frequently so I'm going to stick with it and hope that everything  goes as she says it will.
21	1276	I've had no weight gain but my skin had had some minor trouble but other than that and the spotting everyday I feel great and am happy with my decision.
21	1277	I did have some spotting a few hrs later but that's about it.
21	1278	I have a small amount of spotting (using a small pantyliner, but not enough for a pad).
21	1279	I had my Mirena inserted on Aug 14th and so far other than bloating and spotting, I'm having a good experience with it.
21	1280	It is extremely light, some days barely even spotting, and I haven't needed to use a tampon or anything since.
21	1281	I've been using Mirena for 3 years, after initial spotting I have yet to have a period.
21	1282	I had very light spotting the first couple of weeks, but have not had a period since the insertion (I had the device placed early June 2015).
21	1283	That month I had a light period for 2 weeks and I had some light spotting during the second month after insertion.
21	1284	Occasional pain in pelvis but otherwise haven't had a period since the spotting when it was inserted.
21	1285	I had a 6 week period (last two-ish weeks were just spotting) but since then I have not had a period except for very occasional light spotting after sex (only if I have sex more that once in a day) and it only lasts an hour or so.
21	1286	My period is gone but I have been spotting a tiny bit, nothing crazy.
21	1287	Today feel fine with lt-mod spotting.
21	1288	I have spotting off and on, but I only need a panty liner when it happens.
21	1289	Started my regular period on the 22nd,  for about a week,  and have had some spotting since,  (today is July 1)but nothing too bad.
21	1290	I had the mirena since 4 th june 2015, im 45, and had 12days of light spotting, and the odd headache now and then, and feel really good, i dont feel depresed, i would highly recomend the mirena!
21	1291	So far it's been 2 weeks, heavy flow has slowed to constant spotting and bloated like a blowfish !!
21	1292	I had a little bit of spotting right after.
21	1293	and I am still spotting.
21	1294	The spotting is so irregular that having sex is kinda off the table right now.
21	1295	I am still spotting.
21	1296	I think once I stop spotting I will be happy with the product.
21	1297	Mild spotting.
21	1298	I've had a little spotting since it was inserted but nothing crazy.
21	1299	I had spotting for 3 to 6 months then nothing, I had it for 3 years then had it removed, removal was easy, it didn't hurt and a light period then nothing for 6 weeks then bam period.
21	1300	Since, it has all stopped with only mild spotting here and there and no emotional or other side effects.
21	1301	Since then spotting has stopped and husband cannot feel strings at all.
21	1302	Although periods are milder there is spotting frequently throughout the month.
21	1303	The spotting can be annoying, but my regular period has stopped entirely and my doctor says the spotting will stop soon.
21	1304	I was on Beyaz for three years and the last few months I was spotting daily.
21	1305	I had constant spotting for about 3 weeks which was annoying but the bleeding stopped and now I'm so happy with it!
21	1306	Sometimes I will bleed old, brown blood, but it's just spotting.
21	1307	I quit spotting after 4 1/2 months.
21	1308	I spotted lightly after insertion but I haven't had any spotting today.
21	1309	I never got my period on it but had constant spotting for 9 months as well as serious mood swings.
21	1310	A little spotting every once in a while only hurt for a couple hours on the first day I got it put in.
21	1311	It didn't hurt much and now all I'm doing is spotting.
21	1312	I am due for replacement this month, I started spotting about 4 months ago which seems to time with a monthly cycle, I am assuming this is as the medication is wearing off.
21	1313	Only downside is I'm still spotting but my doctor said it should be gone within a month or so.
21	1314	The pros for me were no period at all just a little spotting every now and then, I did not have any pain at all.
21	1315	I didn't have pain even though my doctor had little problem with putting it in but I felt little to no pressure and light spotting.
21	1316	I have a heavy menstrual flow so I bled and cramped a lot the first three days, but now it's day 5 and I am not even spotting at all.
21	1317	Light spotting occasionally.
21	1318	I was spotting lightly for 6 weeks and almost wanted to take it out, but I waited and the spotting passed.
21	1319	I had some very light spotting, this second time around, maybe a drop of blood during the first day and no bleeding afterwards to my surprise since.
21	1320	I can't have sex ever because I am always spotting!
21	1321	The spotting isn't bad, somedays it requires a panty liner, other days it's not even noticable.
21	1322	I have full faith the spotting will stop within the next 3 months.
21	1323	My breasts are no longer sore, my spots have improved, I've lost over half a stone, not one bit of spotting (a real worry) and the most important thing of all....no thrush!
21	1324	Very jealous of everyone who only had a day or two of spotting.
21	1325	Went to work and had light spotting.
21	1326	It is only a little spotting done.
21	1327	Reviews that stated spotting for months, and painful intercourse, would have been enough to put me off for sure.
21	1328	Now on the 3rd month I am spotting a little bit and no heavy periods.
21	1329	Still spotting constantly.
21	1330	The only thing is that I have been spotting lightly since insertion.
21	1331	I did have spotting light spotting for a month but I haven't had a period since.
21	1332	With that being said I have not had children and got the Mirena during my cycle, I was barely spotting.
21	1333	I had no weight gain, no mood changes, no spotting, was regular like clock work after the initial few weeks after insertion.
21	1334	I occasionally get spotting but it isn't anything bad at all.
21	1335	I had light spotting that day and nothing since.
21	1336	Other than that I have only had light spotting and it has made my period lighter.
21	1337	My periods are about a week and a half long, granted it is light and is more like spotting but it's real inconvenient.
21	1338	But other then that, no spotting, or anything.
21	1339	As far as side effects go I have had spotting before and after my period, and a lighter flow than normal.
21	1340	I just got it removed today and I know to expect spotting and a pretty heavy flow for the next few days, but I love the fact that it is possible for me to get pregnant right away.
21	1341	I had a little bit of spotting for the last year or so, perhaps due to the hormones reducing.
21	1342	I had spotting instead of periods for the first few months, and then my periods stopped completely.
21	1343	I have not had a period or spotting since February of 2008!
21	1344	I have had occasional spotting.
21	1345	This last month I have really noticed that I haven't had a period, I had some spotting for about 3 days.
21	1346	I tend to have spotting or a light period for one or two days every couple months but that's it.
21	1347	I was told about the spotting and I have only had a little one day.
21	1348	I haven%u2019t been spotting at all, just a tiny bit right after the insertion.
21	1349	The first 6 weeks I had constant spotting and swelling.
21	1350	I scheduled it while I was supposed to be on my period (this is when your cervix is more open) but my period that month was just some spotting.
21	1351	But after those 12 hours I was fine and just had 3 weeks of spotting.
21	1352	If you have heavy periods just like I do it reduces them after a couple of months you start spotting & your period only last a couple of days compare to 8 days & no you can not feel anything nor can your partner feel anything.
21	1353	The spotting wasn't really a lot but I always had to wear a liner.
21	1354	I had spotting the 1st day, but that's it.
21	1355	Haven't experience any side effects besides some minor spotting.
21	1356	3 days after insertion I begin to have mild spotting that only required the use of a panty liner but quickly turned into heavy bleeding that lasted 2 weeks then all of sudden stopped as quickly as it came.
21	1357	There has been some mild spotting maybe 2 times a week and only in the morning and it only lasts for about an hour.
21	1358	But since then, I have not had a period, or even any spotting.
21	1359	I've had it for a month now and have had a period for the last 2.5 weeks (it started out as spotting first).
21	1360	I was spotting for the entire time from placement until up until a week ago.
21	1361	I was spotting a little heavy for 2 weeks.
21	1362	I would occasionally get spotting a few weeks after insertion but nothing heavy.
21	1363	But otherwise nothing expect a day on very light spotting.
21	1364	I was not bleeding when I had it in because I was nursing, I knew that I WOULD have some spotting with the Mirena for a few weeks, not a big deal.
21	1365	Well, I went to the doctor 6 months post insertion, my doctor had quit the practice so I had to see a different one, expressed my concerns about still spotting, I was spotting about 25 days a month, and she wouldn't take it out, said it should stop.
21	1366	I had very light spotting the first hour or so afterwards but none since then!
21	1367	First week no spotting but second week spotting then third week spotting but little more.
21	1368	I love it for the fact I have not had a period for the entire time, just a little spotting for about 3 weeks after insertion.
21	1369	It has been good so far, I have not had a period or spotting in almost 4 years.
21	1370	I have been spotting since the insertion too.
21	1371	I spotted non stop for 5 weeks and now have gone 1 full week with no spotting.
21	1372	Five years ago I decided to do the Mirena, the insertion process was a little painful, very little spotting the first couple of weeks, then no periods at all.
21	1373	I had some spotting for a week or two but I've had Mirena since January or February and I LOVE IT.
21	1374	I had small amounts of spotting for 3 days after.
21	1375	I cramped horribly with hardly any spotting for a few days after.
21	1376	Since then, I have had some spotting here and there.
21	1377	I had some light spotting for a month but the bleeding stopped.
21	1378	Unfortunately since then it went down hill I have my period for 20 days and then 6 of spotting so that gives me 2 days of rest.
21	1379	I had continous spotting first few months.
21	1380	Gradually the spotting only came about once a month and eventually stopped.
21	1381	Now my periods have stopped other than long spells of spotting at random times.
21	1382	Took pain killers before and after it was fitted and bled for a few days and took two months for my periods to stop and very light, now I get spotting every four, five months for a few days.
21	1383	I never really stopped spotting or ever had regular periods.
21	1384	I had zero spotting after insertion and haven't had a period since.
21	1385	I now go without periods except the occasional spotting (I would estimate this at 3-4 times a year).
21	1386	My weight gain, bloating, and constant spotting is creating conflict in terms of my decision.
21	1387	Had it in for 3 months and have only had light spotting which is getting less with time.
21	1388	I only had some spotting after that for a few months then it went away.
21	1389	I had spotting for about 2-3 weeks after the procedure.
21	1390	My problems with it: Bled for 4 or 5 months straight completely irregular period and spotting throughout (plus discharge on a daily basis), HORRIBLE migraines at least once or twice a week.
21	1391	3 weeks bleeding spotting.
21	1392	I had some heavy bleeding for about a week after, the light brownish spotting for about 3 weeks.
21	1393	The next 6 months I would have brownish spotting for about a day and a half when I was supposed to get my period, and my breasts would still get tender.
21	1394	Occasional very light spotting.
21	1395	I had light spotting and a week later I had a normal light period.
21	1396	None and then one and then spotting and now last week I had the worst bleeding ever (soaked underwear and pad in blood several times).
21	1397	I've had mild dizziness from time to time and spotting since I got it inserted.
21	1398	This spotting is super irritating, but I'll live.
21	1399	I've had some spotting but it's not even a bother.
21	1400	However, the spotting was so slight it didn't bother me at all.
21	1401	Since then, I have had one period (very light spotting for maybe 2 days) and nothing since!
21	1402	I got the Mirena about four and a half years ago...  Hurt getting it inserted (I haven't had a baby) but after the first six months of minor spotting it finally totally stopped.
21	1403	Sometimes accompanied by spotting.
21	1404	If I have a period at all it is VERY light spotting for 1-3 days maximum...first time having sex he said he could feel it but no more after that.
21	1405	I have had some extremely slight spotting.
21	1406	I had my period for the 1st month, then have had light spotting once a month.
21	1407	The spotting came back after that and I spotted for twenty days out of my cycle.
21	1408	I have been spotting and bleeding on and off since I got it in.
21	1409	The positive thing about this is that I rarely had my periods (only spotting for 2 days) and didn't have to buy pads/tampons, which coming to this decision was very, very hard for me.
21	1410	First month wasn't to bad...spotting all day.
21	1411	There was spotting the entire 6 months I had it in, but it was tapering off quite a bit toward the end.
21	1412	My period has yet to stop altogether but the spotting does not bother me just the irregularity of it.
21	1413	But, eventually, the spotting stopped and I've only spotted for a couple of day in months and months afterwords.
21	1414	I cannot complain about the periods as they have almost completely stopped except for occasional spotting but I could not figure out why I am gaining weight and having breakouts when I never have them and have been working out/eating right since the births.
21	1415	I have light spotting and I still get my symptoms of a period.
21	1416	Some light spotting once.
21	1417	I have had my period since then but it wasn't too heavy and it's become to just daily spotting.
21	1418	I have had some spotting but nothing too heavy, I am a college student so the 5 years of having it will benefit me very well.
21	1419	Now I am hardly spotting at all, and looking forward to the next five years.
21	1420	I haven't gained any weight, my eating and sleeping patterns are exactly the same, no pain, no spotting.
21	1421	It stopped and I haven't had anything at all - no spotting or anything.
21	1422	Although it is manageable with low salt diet and pills, it gets worse around my period, which has now started spotting randomly...about every 2 weeks.
21	1423	My period was nonexistent within the first 3 months, after some initial irregular spotting.
21	1424	I'm still having very slight spotting, but no real periods since the insertion, which I'm very happy about because of my painful periods with likely endometriosis.
21	1425	Still spotting nothing to worry about.
21	1426	The only complaint I have about it is that since the insertion, I've had spotting everyday.
21	1427	Only downside is that the spotting occurs out of nowhere, but it's easily fixed.
21	1428	After the next two weeks, I received my period at first, it was just spotting.
21	1429	Now I have light spotting once a month for a couple of days but this is way easier than the pill, the patch or any other birth control.
21	1430	I also had constant spotting.
21	1431	When my Mirena was inserted I experienced approximately 5 months of spotting.
21	1432	Since my last period I have experienced light spotting, most common after intercourse.
21	1433	I've had light spotting off and on and some cramping/backache.
21	1434	I will occasionally have periods of spotting.
21	1435	Originally I had bleeding on and off but now its just mild spotting.
21	1436	It was mostly heavy spotting, but it was inconvenient for three months.
21	1437	Well the bleeding is no longer heavy, however I'm spotting and also having weird discharge everyday.
21	1438	I had constant spotting, painful intercourse, my husband said he could feel the string.
21	1439	Then didn't get my period or spotting for a whole year and now I get a regular period every month.
21	1440	I don't even get spotting.
21	1441	My periods are a little more normal now, but start really early with spotting for days before the regular flow starts.
21	1442	Not only has the spotting stopped but my period is over.
21	1443	Everything was cool till about a week later when I began "spotting", which really just means I have not had light bleeding every day for the last 8 days.
21	1444	After the spotting I no longer suffered terrible cycles I may spot for a day every 6 months or so.
21	1445	I had spotting the first 8 days but nothing a liner could not handle.
21	1446	But after 6 months, it lightened up and now I only have light spotting.
21	1447	Not to mention spotting, and not knowing when my period was coming on.
21	1448	Since insertion I've had minor spotting, and very little pain.
21	1449	Easy enough procedure, usual spotting, then no periods.
21	1450	I got the Mirena last year a few days before Thanksgiving and I bled (first heavy, then light spotting) all the way until New Year's Day, 2010.
21	1451	My cycle renewed itself the 2nd week in January, and now, mid-February, I'm still spotting.
21	1452	Continued spotting.
21	1453	I finally stopped spotting at around 10-11 months after Mirena was put in.
21	1454	The period was annoying, long, short, spotting,and now no period at all!
21	1455	Now, I don't have bleeding at all, only spotting for about 2 days per month.
21	1456	Today is the least amount of spotting I've had which is 4 days later.
21	1457	I am spotting and have on a pantyliner.
21	1458	For three weeks thereafter, I experience light spotting and wore a pantyliner.
21	1459	For the next four months, I would spot beginning the same day each month for a week followed by a regular light period two weeks after the spotting subsided.
21	1460	There was mild spotting for the first couple of weeks, but that stopped.
21	1461	What I did have was 8 SOLID months of spotting.
21	1462	Periods are now light spotting but almost non-existent.
21	1463	I finally stopped bleeding and only occasionally do I have some spotting - nothing a pantyliner can't handle.
21	1464	Now I have been spotting here and there and having long periods but was told that should regulate after 6 months so I am sitting tight for that.
21	1465	I was breastfeeding my second child, so that might be the reason but no "real" period, just some light spotting.
21	1466	During the insertion it was kind of uncomfortable but today has been back to normal besides some minor spotting.
21	1467	I have had some spotting but nothing concerning and my partner has no complaints of feeling the strings.
21	1468	They say there can be spotting, but it's been more than spotting for me.
21	1469	I did have spotting for about 6 weeks after.
21	1470	There was some light spotting at first.
21	1471	I used to have really heavy, really painful periods (which is why I went with Mirena over the paraguard) and though I was supposed to get my period the week after they put it in I haven't had anything but super light, almost non-existent spotting.
21	1472	I've had back aches for first month along with spotting.
21	1473	I spot every now and then and almost always have brown discharge.
21	1474	Yes insertion was painful and I did have a decently long time (about 3 months) where I would spot or bleed but after having it for 4 years now, I can honestly say it's so worth it.
21	1475	Some months I spot for a day and some months not at all.
21	1476	I tried the Pill, and all it did was make me spot and have periods that lasted for weeks- so I stopped using it.
21	1477	I tend to spot from time to time around my period time, but it's extremely light and short.
21	1478	I only spot for a day or two.
21	1479	I spot bled for about a week until I got my period which lasted for 13 days.
21	1480	After my first period I didn't spot or anything.
21	1481	Once in a great while I'll spot a little bit.
21	1482	I don't get a period anymore, might spot for one day every few months.
21	1483	I spot occasionally.
21	1484	I spot occasionally and have a very light period it's very nice !
21	1485	After being on it almost 4 years I randomly spot, but it's done it's job.
21	1486	I still sometimes spot And my period is not regular anymore but that comes with it.
21	1487	I don't really ever spot on a very rare occasion.
21	1488	After that some months I wouldn't even spot at all.
21	1489	I lightly spot for a day or less every month when I can feel changes and a period is supposed to be present.
21	1490	I had the Mirena for the full 5 years and only experienced a pre menstrual facial spot and 3 days of mild tummy bloating prior to each predictable and very light two day bleed.
21	1491	Now I spot every now and then but not very much.
21	1492	It has controlled my bleeding alot but  I still spot alot through the month.
21	1493	I spot every once in a while, but rarely have periods.
21	1494	I still spot for a day or two every couple months, which I can live with.
21	1495	I did spot for several months and then it almost completely disappeared.
21	1496	I almost always spot after the PMS symptoms.
21	1497	Since I have had the Mirena I have not had a single spot of blood.
21	1498	I haven't had a period in over a year, I never spot, no mood swings, no bloating, no loss in sex drive, the only bad thing I would say is I've experienced some hair loss.
21	1499	Not sure if this has happened to anyone else and I also feel like I spot just as long as I would have had a period.
21	1500	The 5th and final year of me having Mirena, I started to spot monthly.
21	1501	I spot for one day every two months and that is all.
21	1502	It is now five months after insertion and I did spot for less time but no period came.
21	1503	I had spot bleeding for over 2 months and the worst part was the abnormal smell and discharge.
21	1504	I still have had light periods and lots of spot bleeding in between.
21	1505	I spotted constantly for the first 3 months.
21	1506	I spotted every now and then the first couple months but my doctor prescribed me estrogen to take for about a week to stop the bleeding.
21	1507	Only spotted the day that I got it.
21	1508	I am now 33, had my 2nd one inserted and cramped, spotted or a light period for first 4 months.
21	1509	I gained 20lb without changing my diet, spotted for a year straight with no breaks, and was an overall mess.
21	1510	I only spotted for a few days afterwards.
21	1511	Afterwards I spotted for about 5 days and that was the end of that.
21	1512	I wanted to try a new form of birth control because I always forgot to take the pill and I spotted really bad with the nuvaring.
21	1513	For the next 6 months I spotted or bled almost 3/4 weeks a month & had heavier bleeding for about 10 days during those 3 weeks.
21	1514	I have spotted a few times in the last 6 years.
21	1515	I spotted for a few days, but that went away and there was nothing until my period.
21	1516	After I had it inserted, I spotted and cramped for one day.
21	1517	For the five years that I had the first one, I only spotted periodically.
21	1518	At first it was like an ordinary period, but it didn't end like one because I spotted for a whole month straight But after that I've been period free for almost a year.
21	1519	I spotted for the 1st month and a half.
21	1520	I spotted maybe a week.
21	1521	I spotted for about a month, 10 of those days I needed more than a panty liner.
21	1522	I randomly spotted for the first 2 months or so - not terrible, just annoying.
21	1523	I had the Mirena for almost a year and it was effective with pregnancy but I had horrible mood swings, I was bloated and although I didn't have a period each month I constantly spotted especially during sex which was a huge turn off for my partner and I.
21	1524	I spotted and had irregular periods for the first 2 months, it was really annoying.
21	1525	Then I spotted occasionally for another two months or so.
21	1526	I spotted all the time on this and got really random heavy periods.
21	1527	Bled and spotted for 3 months and then stopped.
21	1528	I spotted for about 3 1/2 months straight.
21	1529	I LOVED it the first time I occasionally spotted but rarely more than 1 day.
21	1530	When I first got it I spotted  for the first 6 months pretty heavily, but I expected that.
21	1531	Once or twice a year since then I spotted for about a day, but it was hardly a big deal.
21	1532	But I spotted off and on for 6 months (same as the other time) then my periods stopped completely, for 8 months!
21	1533	I spotted the entire time, I had absolutely NO libido, my poor husband.
21	1534	I spotted during my normal period week for the next 5-6 months, but very light and not like a full on period at all.
21	1535	After my Mirena was inserted (I had it inserted the first day of my period), I spotted for a solid month.
21	1536	I've spotted a little everyday.
21	1537	I spotted a day or so after insertion.
21	1538	I spotted for the first 10 months I was on Mirena...constantly!
21	1539	I also spotted for like 4 days after the insertion.
21	1540	But when I first got the Mirena it was so painful, I cramped and spotted everyday for a months.
21	1541	I had Mirena placed at my 7 week check up after my second son and everything seemed fine at first, I spotted the first 6 mos like the nurse said I would, she said my periods may even go away.
21	1542	During the second year I still spotted every 3-4 months but no major bleeding.
21	1543	Then, I spotted for a straight two months!
21	1544	I spotted for about one week, then dried up and have had nothing and I mean NOTHING ever since.
21	1545	I also spotted for the first week, but I just wore a pantyliner and I was fine.
21	1546	I had no problems and only spotted every couple of months if that.
21	1547	For the first 6 weeks I spotted off and on and then my periods just stopped.
21	1548	For the 1st couple of months I spotted irregularly, but after that, my periods stopped all together.
21	1549	My doctor told me since I hadn't been getting my period while breastfeeding, Mirena would more then likely stop my periods, which so far I haven't even spotted one day.
21	1550	Had it in for three hours and the headache and dizziness started.
21	1551	Luckily was able to get it removed within 24 hours, but the headache is still here five hours later.
21	1552	I had a headache, dizziness,  I felt pregnant, bloated and it give your vagina a awful smell.
21	1553	I have already noticed a small amount of weight loss and haven't has a headache for a while.
21	1554	Afterwards I felt No craps, no nausea, no headache and even to this day no weight gain.
21	1555	At the most every day for a week and I had never had even a small headache before this birth control.
21	1556	I have not had any bleeding since I've had it inserted, nor have I had headache or nausea.
21	1557	No matter what I took for the headache.
21	1558	Went to sleep with headache and awoke with same headache for 5 of my six day period.
21	1559	I have constant headaches, a weight gain of 20 pounds in FOUR months.
21	1560	Also been getting headaches that won't go away.
21	1561	After experiencing horrid headaches during the placebo week of the pill, I opted for Mirena.
21	1562	I also experience really bad headaches.
21	1563	I get headaches almost everyday, and I'm very moody.
21	1564	I started to get headaches.
21	1565	I did not think much of it at first, but the headaches got worse with each year going by and the increased severely towards having headaches each day - whole day.
21	1566	My headaches effected my job, my concentration, my relationship, any outdoor activities, sport & exercise.
21	1567	This spiraled into very high blood pressure, severe heart palpitations, chest tightness, severe panic attacks, severe depression, severe brain fog, joint pain and headaches.
21	1568	Nothing but heavier periods, headaches, mood swings, weight gain, just all around pain in the ass.
21	1569	This thing is bad, and it took me a loooong time to realize everything is connected.. bloating, constipation, intestinal pain, cysts, mood swings, headaches, brittle hair and nails.. etc.
21	1570	The pain of insertion is worth it, I have no periods, no headaches, no moodiness and my husband doesn't seem to notice it is even there!
21	1571	In the month that I had it I gained 5 lbs, had headaches every day, was nauseous and felt like I was 3 months pregnant, could not sit comfortably, I experienced irritability.
21	1572	I have had no periods since then which is great, and my headaches have also reduced.
21	1573	So I have been on the Depo shit for well over a decade and decided to opt for a different method due to the weight gain, headaches and bone density concerns.
21	1574	I no longer have pain, no longer have headaches that the pill gave me .
21	1575	I've felt like shit, bad headaches, tired and everything.
21	1576	I broke out in a cold sweat when I tried to get up and had to lie back down another 15 minutes, even after lying there about 15 minutes initially.Now, daily headaches and extreme moodiness.
21	1577	And so far I get headaches everyday, I feel nauseous about half the day.
21	1578	I have severe headaches that cause my vision to be blurry in one eye and my left side of my body goes numb.
21	1579	I got it when I was 18 years old - I am not a candidate for most other forms of birth control because of my migraine headaches, so Mirena seemed like a good solution.
21	1580	I gained 20 lbs and have headaches.
21	1581	I get constant headaches everyday.
21	1582	I had migraine level headaches when I was on the pill for the duration of my period.
21	1583	It was ok for a while, I've lost weight but have headaches and I'm nauseus alot and my back hurts, bleeding alot after sex.
21	1584	However, the bloating and headaches still come at the same time every month.
21	1585	I have bad mood swings, nausea, abdominal pains so severe sometimes I want to cry, headaches at least 3 times a week, weight gain, bloating (badly) and extreme tiredness.
21	1586	I have felt like I have had no energy at times, have horrible headaches, felt sick suddenly, moody and depression.
21	1587	I've been getting migraines and horrible headaches since I was 17.
21	1588	Having the Mirena hasn't helped my headaches, but I'm not sure if it's made them worst either.
21	1589	Unfortunately I have suffered, horrible headaches, SEVERE bloating, flatulence and weight gain and skin rash.
21	1590	After my second child was born in 2008 I suffered from almost daily tension/migraine headaches.
21	1591	I wanted to try Mirena as a solution to birth control and possibly help my headaches.
21	1592	I am having terrible headaches and heartburn.
21	1593	Right now, I have gained 10lbs, loss of sex drive, have headaches, back pain, insomnia, constipation, hair loss and general depression - OF COURSE that's going to cause to have mood swings.
21	1594	I always experienced headaches, terrible mood swings, nausea, weight gain and actually forgetting (the pill).
21	1595	But I have been really moody - short temper and have headaches all the time.
21	1596	I have had an MRI to rule out any issues with the dizziness and headaches as they did not start until about a month and a half after placement.
21	1597	Then had a migraine for the rest of the day.
21	1598	I also had an awful migraine that lasted 3 days.
21	1599	My first period afterwards lasted for like 10 days and I had the worse migraine EVER.
21	1600	I had migraine, anger, muscle pains, back pain, horrible fatigue, head pressure, sinus, and fuzzy thinking.
21	1601	I haven't had a migraine since then.
21	1602	I was unable to continue BC pills because even on the lowest dose I was experiencing eye-blinding migraines.
21	1603	However, I am prone to long horrendous periods and migraines without BC and since the initial bleeding has stopped, my migraines are fewer and the bleeding seems to be as well.
21	1604	Quick recap the insertion was not painful...1st week I had 3 very painful migraines as I was adjusting to the hormone change.
21	1605	Wasn't much of a surprise being that I have migraines (not as bad) on my period.
21	1606	The second insertion has been very similar, however the past year and a half I've dealt with weight game, migraines, mild lower abdominal pains and change in mood.
21	1607	I had to stop the combined pill (Yasmin) after 3 years as I had started getting migraines.
21	1608	I suffer from migraines so I couldn't take the pill, this was the next alternative and boy am I glad this was it!!!
21	1609	Previously on the pill but had terrible hormonal symptoms, depression, no sex drive and severe migraines.
21	1610	No migraines since having it put in ( previously having them almost daily)!
21	1611	I'm prone to migraines around my menstral cycle and I noticed they were gone.
21	1612	My hair fell out, I would have 5 day long migraines, I could feel it when sitting, I was an emotional wreck!
21	1613	I went back in to my doctor who talked me into keeping it, making me feel like I was over reacting and my options of birth control were limited due to having migraines.
21	1614	I can't take oral hormones due to migraines.
21	1615	Due to having migraines with aura, I needed an estrogen-free form of BC.
21	1616	So I had the mirena put in about 2 years ago after migraines and worsening of depression made practically every other contraceptive contraindicated for me.
21	1617	I was about to change my mind and not have mirena inserted..till my dr told me I would have to pay for it as he had already opened it for insertion .I never got a period, no bleeding,  I lost insurance and refused to rack up more debt in medical bills and just hoped all was good despite constantly being tired migraines daily and bumps in my pelvic area under skin and pain and bloating.
21	1618	During the holidays I was met with 3 massive migraines all within 3 weeks including Christmas day.
21	1619	I also would get crippling migraines, mood swings that lead to serious bouts of depression, my sex drive is pretty much nonexistent.
21	1620	Terrible stabbing pain all over, migraines every single day, my right leg is numb all the way down to my knee.
21	1621	Also, I never experienced migraines in the past, and since the mirena I get them frequently (at least one biweekly) that brings nausea and effects my vision.
21	1622	I have high hormone levels which makes regular birth control a nightmare due to the frequent migraines.
21	1623	I get classic migraines and can't take estrogen birth control.
21	1624	Some of the estrogen based birth control gives me migraines and causes me to be moody.
21	1625	Went on Mirena as it was one of my only options for birth control due to hormone issues and aura migraines.
21	1626	And after a while started giving me migraines, which became more and more frequent with time.
21	1627	So nice not having to worry about either migraines OR taking a pill everyday since I am a busy medical student working crazy hours in the hospital.
21	1628	I had more than half of the side effects of Mirena, which included, but not limited to, depressed mood, migraines, back aches, swelling, weight gain, dizziness, sometimes painful intercourse.
21	1629	It has helped me have fewer migraines, it is so great to not have a period and love not having to worry about getting pregnant.
21	1630	I have thought about getting it taken out, but I really don't want to go back to horrible migraines or any other form of birth control.
21	1631	I switched to Mirena from Seasonale birth control because I get migraines with visual auras.
21	1632	Taking an estrogen based birth control pill is contraindicated in women with visual aura migraines as it increases the risk of ischemic stroke.
21	1633	No pills to remember, rings to change or give me migraines, or patches to remove.
21	1634	I haven't had one problem with it like pills that gave me migraines.
21	1635	Also, I had to go on a non-estrogen form of contraception because I have migraines with auras, and I think these is a great alternative to oral contraceptive pills!
21	1636	Have migraines, hip and abdominal pain, heartburn.
21	1637	My hips hurt, migraines and nausea everyday, and abdominal pains that just never go away.
21	1638	Mirena insertion was extremely painfully, but after having it in for almost 2 years, I had it removed due to the hormones causing extreme migraines.
21	1639	But about 4 months after I got Mirena I start having sharps pains in my side and migraines every-single-day!
21	1640	I chose the Mirena after suffering severe migraines on the pill.
21	1641	I am most happy to  report NO migraines and I lost weight!
21	1642	I have hot flashes all the time, I am getting migraines everyday for the last two months.
21	1643	I am 24 years old  I chose mirena for the simply fact that birth control pill was killing my sex drive.
21	1644	But I've had my Mirena for a little over 2 years now and I've gained 40-50 pounds with no change in diet, I have absolutely no energy for anything (I work and go to school full time), and I'm recently married with no sex drive.
21	1645	I have ZERO sex drive and I'm constantly tired.
21	1646	I have depression and it has not worsened my symptoms, and actually has improved my sex drive.
21	1647	My sex drive is non existing anymore so that birth control within it own!
21	1648	0 sex drive.
21	1649	I didn't have a sex drive for the first 3 days but on the 4th day I was ready to go.
21	1650	Sex drive unaffected.
21	1651	My mood is more stable and sex drive is greater than it was when I was on Yasmin.
21	1652	I have literally no sex drive, and I'm always moody.
21	1653	Zero sex drive, moody, temper change.. i feel it... (from Singapore)
21	1654	Constant cervical irritation and bloating with no sex drive.
21	1655	The only downfalls I had being on Mirena was that I almost no sex drive which put a little bit of a strain on my relationship.
21	1656	I bled for weeks on end (like 4-5 at a time), was moody and no longer had any sex drive.
21	1657	I've also completely lost my sex drive and have been feeling overwhelmingly emotional for the last few months, on the verge of tears constantly (how I used to feel for about 2 days before a regular period).
21	1658	I have no sex drive and sex can be painful.
21	1659	Since then I have had no sex drive and despite all my efforts can't lose weight, starting to think this is the issue, thinking about going to gyn to be removed.
21	1660	Since then (a year ago), I have gained 12kg's (no change to my diet etc etc), have back and pelvic pains and inflammations all of the time and no sex drive.
21	1661	However, I'm changing to copper as recently I have severe mood swing, low sex drive, weight never gone down.
21	1662	However, I haven't been able to keep a stable weight and I've been a bit down on everything and also have highs and lows with my sex drive.
21	1663	However after only having it in for a month I did bleed for a week but nothing since, but my sex drive is non existent.
21	1664	I like it and it has helped the bleeding now I just wish I could get my sex drive back and loose weight.
21	1665	I am debating whether to get it removed because I have gained weight and my sex drive is just so low now.
21	1666	I haven't had any pain from it, no changes to my sex drive, and I don't have to think about it.
21	1667	Was depressed, mood swings, no sex drive, painful sex, cyst on ovaries, it migrated and was extremely painful being removed.
21	1668	I have an increase in sex drive for sure!
21	1669	Con's the bad part is mood swings,no sex drive ever and your body not getting rid of the blood that its supposed to every month .
21	1670	My sex drive disappeared entirely.
21	1671	I had the iud for exactly two years at first it was amazing i didn't get any side effects but for some reason within my second year my back started hurting and I lost my sex drive I couldn't handle it anymore so I went to the doctors yesterday and got it removed.
21	1672	My sex drive is gone.
21	1673	I've noticed mood swings, weight gain and total loss of any sex drive.
21	1674	My mood is normal and my sex drive actually increased.
21	1675	But the longer I had it in I feel depressed at times lack of sex drive and bipolar at times.
21	1676	although my sex drive is Crazy.
21	1677	I have zero sex drive, have gained 20 pounds that I cannot lose to save my life, constantly have discharge, and bleed and hurt after intercourse.
21	1678	My sex drive has become very high.
21	1679	But i noticed iv been gaining weight and its been hard to loose .. iv been having lots of mood swing and always feeling angry and depression ... but a crazy sex drive.
21	1680	It has prevented pregnancy, sex drive is about the same.
21	1681	The only symptoms I have noticed are being more aggressive and an even higher sex drive.
21	1682	I feel like my sex drive has increased.
21	1683	It reduced my period frequency & the amount, BUT it completely killed my sex drive, which now, 2 years later is still non existent.
21	1684	Even he is now convinced that my lack of a sex drive, weight gain & inability to loose weight is a side effect of the Mirena.
21	1685	I was pleased with it at first but now I have noticed extreme hair thinning, low to no sex drive and gained about 10lbs I can't seem to lose.
21	1686	My sex drive is actually increased too:)
21	1687	Negative side though, zero sex drive.
21	1688	Sex drive has decreased dramatically and have gained close to 12 lbs.
21	1689	My sex drive is slowly returning also, it seems mad that such a small device can seemingly mend years of infections.
21	1690	My sex drive has decreased so my partner has to work a little harder to get me going.
21	1691	Mirena is supposed to decrease your sex drive but honestly it has increased mine and my partner and I love it!
21	1692	I can say my sex drive has decreased in the last year to where I don't want it at all.
21	1693	Also my sex drive but if I can only get a hold on this anger I believe my sex drive would get better.
21	1694	I few days later I actually woke up with a sex drive!!
21	1695	Sex drive is the same.
21	1696	I was on the pill for 6 years, which killed my sex drive.
21	1697	My breakouts are clearing up little by little and sex drive has NOT been affected.
21	1698	And it doesn't affect my sex drive at all.
21	1699	I didn't gain weight or got mood swings nor did my sex drive go down.
21	1700	My sex drive was low and I would get panic attacks and have horrible mood swings.
21	1701	I have had longer periods actually, they have lasted up to 14 days I have experience some bloating not much though and my sex drive is low.
21	1702	Still have my sex drive.
21	1703	I have NEVER not had a sex drive.
21	1704	And my sex drive is back fast and furious!
21	1705	The only down side is my sex drive has nose dived.
21	1706	Even since, I have been experiencing increasing hair loss, an increased appetite, daily fatigue, lower sex drive, mood swings, unexplainable sadness.
21	1707	I haven't experienced any of the potential nasty side effects, and I think I actually have an increased sex drive.
21	1708	I've had 1 period, my sex drive is great.
21	1709	Sex drive is still great as ever.
21	1710	No sex drive either.
21	1711	I now am suffering from lack of energy, low sex drive and an overall sick feeling most of the day.
21	1712	It has improved my sex drive and sex life and thus as a couple my husband and I can enjoy a better relationship.
21	1713	My waist has become more curvy and sex drive more intense.
21	1714	My sex drive has also gone down and hard to climax.
21	1715	No sex drive, horrible depression, anxiety and mood swings, insomnia, nausea, face break out (never even had a zit), and horrible muscular pain.
21	1716	My sex drive is fine maybe even higher but I can't handle the smell - its not a bad smell I've just never had a smell so this thing has to go.
21	1717	No weight gain, I'm petite though, increase sex drive!
21	1718	My sex drive is the same and I feel that I can enjoy sex better with the Mirena knowing that I don't have to worry about pregnancy.
21	1719	I have serious mood swings, depression, no sex drive and vaginal dryness.
21	1720	The Mirena is a good option however, I have experienced hair loss and I am sometimes moody and my sex drive has decreased.
21	1721	I have also had no sex drive, major mood swings, short temper and always feel pregnant but every test said no.
21	1722	I have no sex drive and very little patience with anything or anyone.
21	1723	I switch to Mirena because I has absolutely no sex drive on the pill!
21	1724	Since having Mirena, my sex drive is back to normal and period was very light!
21	1725	I would recommend this to anyone who wants an easy form of birth control or for anyone who wants their sex drive back.
21	1726	I will say my sex drive is very high with this and that is a plus for me and my husband.
21	1727	I am very depressed, hair loss, absolutely ZERO sex drive, moody, tired ALL the time...and the list goes on.
21	1728	I some what lost my sex drive.
21	1729	Unfortunately I am one of the rare ones that experienced the uncommon side effects such as: No sex drive at all, and to be honest I am sexually frustrated and no matter what we do nothing will get me excited.
21	1730	It has pros and cons like anything but truly effective..no weight gain actually lost weight, no mood swing and didn't lose sex drive!
21	1731	I have no sex drive and my weight has plateaued!
21	1732	I don't know what made me look into it, but I realized that over the past 4 years I have gained over 35lbs.,my sex drive is almost non-existent, I am often dry during intercourse.
21	1733	My sex drive has increased and my partner can't feel the wires during.
21	1734	I got Mirena over a year ago, and for the first year it was great, but then I started to lose my sex drive.
21	1735	However, my sex drive has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY and I'm starting to worry.
21	1736	I have experienced COMPLETE lack of sex drive, hair loss/thinning, depressed moods and anger.
21	1737	I feel and look bloated and I have barely any sex drive and when I do most of the time sex hurts.
21	1738	I have just begun to notice within the last 9 months or so that I am slowly gaining weight, don't feel very good, severe bloating, tired, moody, no patience, depressed, and no sex drive at all.
21	1739	I've experienced mood swings and loss of sex drive.
21	1740	My sex drive went completely out the window.
21	1741	All girls are moody so its hard to say that its the birth controls fault but I do notice a lower sex drive, although not much.
21	1742	The pain in my lower right area never went away, I experienced myself having very depressing thoughts, loss of motivation, and NO SEX DRIVE.
21	1743	I have been very moody and my sex drive is no where to be seen.
21	1744	My sex drive is still great, and I don't have to pay every month for birth control.
21	1745	I did experience a lot of hair loss and over time, my sex drive diminished.
21	1746	Also my sex drive has hit rock bottom, I never have the urge to have sex, I am getting the Mirena out.
21	1747	I started to get severe pains in my right hip and side, severe bleeding where I doubled up on the sanitaries and still bled through, no sex drive and I have had a few instances where I have lost feeling in my legs.
21	1748	The last year however has been AWFUL, NO sex drive at all!
21	1749	Since then, I have gotten progressively moody, have close to no sex drive and have gained close to fifty pounds!
21	1750	There's also dizziness, depression, irritability, insomnia and a VERY low sex drive (odd for a 22yr old).
21	1751	Plus I have NO sex drive whatsoever.
21	1752	It is a very effective birth control, but I have noticed a change in my sex drive.
21	1753	Or non existent sex drive.
21	1754	I got it hoping to get lighter periods and an increased sex drive.
21	1755	I had been taking birth control pills, which can negatively affect your sex drive.
21	1756	The first one my husband couldn't feel at all, the second one poked him a few times depending on position but we both agreed the benefits far outweighed the negatives for both of us - no period, no moods swings, no cysts on my ovaries, better libido, all of which were a problem on the pill
21	1757	I also noticed others were mentioning pain during intercourse and lack of libido: Totally!!!!!!!
21	1758	The only issue I've had is low libido but that could also be related to another issue I was diagnosed with too.
21	1759	After six months of using it, I lost my libido.
21	1760	After one year, I took the mirena out and in one day my libido returned.
21	1761	spoting for 1st 3 months, have had one in for about 4 and a half years but am feeling really tired lately even after a good night sleep, low libido and a bit irritable lately.
21	1762	The side effects I am experiencing are breast tenderness, and increased libido.
21	1763	Since he was born I have suffered from insomnia, mood swings, weight gain, impossible weight loss, odor & discharge, yeast infections, and zero libido.
21	1764	No issues with sex & I think my libido has gone up.
21	1765	I have lost weight and my mood and libido have greatly improved.
21	1766	My libido has also increased (compared to when I was on the pill).
21	1767	I have an increased libido, and it is nice to not have to remember to take a pill every single night.
21	1768	Definitely decreased libido and vaginal dryness as well.
21	1769	My libido has increased and my orgasms are now so intense (they were fairly strong before the Mirena) that my partner has noticed a huge difference and had I known I would have had it inserted years ago!
21	1770	I can now though report that since I've had Mirena, I have NO libido whatsoever and I hear this is a very common symptom.
21	1771	I have had some slight side effects of slight weight gain and loss of libido - however these I keep in check with exercise and an understanding partner.
21	1772	My libido is terrible, to the point that I feel bad for my husband.
21	1773	I used to have a very high libido and now I could care less.
21	1774	My mood and libido has remained the same.
21	1775	All the while my depression got worse, my face broke out, I lost my libido, I gained weight and my stomach bloated.
21	1776	Only downside is a little libido loss.
21	1777	I didn't have any dizziness, I bleed for a couple days (but it was no more then a period), I also didn't need to take any pain meds, I have no weight gain or change in my skin.
21	1778	Yes it is very effective for birth control, BUT I have had unexpected weight gain of 40-50 pounds!
21	1779	I cannot explain this weight gain, I am ready for removal.
21	1780	At first I thought the depression, hair loss, and weight gain was just me but after reading other comments I see that it wasn't.
21	1781	The moods swings were horrible, hair loss, I was tired all the time with anxiety, depression, weight gain (125lbs) that I could not shed with the IUD, no sexual desire, vaginal dryness, yeast infections.
21	1782	No weight gain.
21	1783	No weight gain or mood changes and my skin is still clear.
21	1784	weight gain, depression, back pain, abdominal pain, skin issues, tired, bloating, mood swings etc.
21	1785	And he said that there is no side effects at all.. weight gain is my most concerned issue and now.. i have gained 4.5kg (10lb).
21	1786	I have had no weight gain, no negative effects at all.
21	1787	No periods, no major side effects(only a little weight gain).
21	1788	The weight gain continued about 5 months and topped out at 35 pounds.
21	1789	Had it not been for the weight gain, I would have kept mirena forever.
21	1790	Had horrible sickness and weight gain.
21	1791	WEIGHT GAIN.
21	1792	No crazy weight gain.
21	1793	During my time on the birth control I experienced mood swings, hair loss, weight gain, inner aching, numerous ovarian cysts, and more yeast and bacterial infections than I can keep count of (over 30).
21	1794	I have terrible mood swings, bloating, weight gain (even with proper diet and exercise), gassy, hair breakage, moderate almost uncontrollable depression (when I have had little and controlled it before), yeast infections, I mean the TMI list can go on and on.
21	1795	It is now March 16' and all I've had is weight gain and I mean I am 80 pounds heavier since having the Mirena.
21	1796	It does its job and I've had no pregnancies but the weight gain is terrible
21	1797	I thought the aches and pains where due to weight gain.
21	1798	In theory, it would have been the perfect contraceptive, but I'm scheduling an appointment to take it out because of rapid weight gain.
21	1799	I'd rather just get pregnant over and over again, I had weight gain, depression lots of pain.
21	1800	The removal was actually hurt more) Anyways, the first year I had irregular periods, but no weight gain, no moodiness, no pain during sec, or lack of sex drive-  so that was great.
21	1801	No greasy hair/skin, no mood swings/low libido/insomnia, but the weight gain has been rapid.
21	1802	Advantages outway weight gain for now.
21	1803	Weight gain & bloating like never before
21	1804	I am wondering if the mirena has caused a slight weight gain and having trouble to get the weight off though.
21	1805	I'm curious to know when those who mentioned it caused weight gain started to notice it?
21	1806	If the weight gain continues I will write another review, but at this point my experience has been great.
21	1807	There have been no mood swings, no heavy bleeding, no weight gain and no other noticeable side effects.
21	1808	Other than the insane weight gain, the mirena has been very effective and painless.
21	1809	I am worried about the weight gain but I plan on staying active and keep a close eye on
21	1810	Also, I am completely convinced that it is the cause of my weight gain.
21	1811	It also has not caused any weight gain like the pill does.
21	1812	I have had it for 6 months and weight gain has been an issue.
21	1813	I also have not noticed any significant weight gain like some people do with certain birth controls.
21	1814	I absolutely loved mine, and I had no problems with weight gain.
21	1815	I am 24, no kids and have tried every other Birth Control under the sun (including Implanon) all gave me constant thrush and weight gain!
21	1816	No weight gain no moodiness higher sex drive.. only one down is that my husband says he can feel a sharp poke when he penetrated deeply.
21	1817	No weight gain or loss.
21	1818	I even have noticed I have lost a few pounds versus the weight gain of traditional birth control pills.
21	1819	I'm in my early 20s and was hesitant to start other forms of birth control because it is hard for me to remember to take pills and I was worried about the weight gain.
21	1820	I've had no weight gain on Mirena and no extremely noticeable side effects.
21	1821	I hope it goes as smoothly as it did the first time I had it, never had any problems except maybe weight gain but I don't know if it was due to the birth control or not.
21	1822	Talked to her and two other doctors about side effects and there will be no weight gain, slight periods if any and can stay in for up to five years.
21	1823	My periods practically disappeared and I didn't have significant weight gain.
21	1824	I have had significant weight gain, anxiety, my hair has changed texture, my skin is oily, and the mood swings are horrid.
21	1825	No weight gain, I go to the gym and i have been losing all my baby weight.
21	1826	I am miserable with the weight gain and bloating.
21	1827	I have had no weight gain or mood changes.
21	1828	I loved not having periods and nothing to remember but it's caused severe depression, insane weight gain, hair loss and tiredness.
21	1829	Mirena does it's job well but I can not tolerate the weight gain.
21	1830	No weight gain, no terrible skin conditions, no pain and no menstruation for five years!
21	1831	I have experienced slight hair loss and weight gain.
21	1832	I LOST 45 pounds - not because of Mirena, mind you - since I've had Mirena so weight gain was determinately not a side effect for me.
21	1833	I can't stand the weight gain.
21	1834	No pregnancy, no weight gain, no periods, and mostly no pain.
21	1835	After that I had my period for 2 months straight with serious mood swings, cravings and weight gain.
21	1836	Didn't notice any weight gain although I noticed it was very hard to lose weight as I began working out a lot more and eating better so I should have lost weight.
21	1837	I went into depression, mood swings and weight gain.
21	1838	No weight gain or any other horrible side effects.
21	1839	Mirena may not make you gain weight but it does increase your appetite which ultimately leads to weight gain.
21	1840	I don't have any complaints when it comes to weight gain, my skin actually got clearer and for the most part had painless, lighter periods.
21	1841	Maybe slight weight gain but it could also be because I'm getting older.
21	1842	No weight gain, but only had it in for five months.
21	1843	No weight gain I can associate from the IUD.
21	1844	weight gain, slower metabolism) are common side effects of the pill too.
21	1845	Also, I've been lucky and I haven't experienced any weight gain from it.
21	1846	I've experienced some slight weight gain (7 lbs) that's hard to shed, and the irregular periods sometimes throw me off.
21	1847	Then I have been to the the hospital several times with pain, bleeding, hair loss and my weight gain.
21	1848	The only bad thing is the mild weight gain.
21	1849	Cramping, 50lbs weight gain, horrible mood swings (worse than pregnancy mood swings), severe depression and insomnia.
21	1850	I kind of feel that I have had weight gain from it (after having my son, I lost 20-25 lbs right off the bat).
21	1851	No weight gain, nothing crazy like hot flashes or anything.
21	1852	I have had no weight gain, actually lost 3 lbs so far.
21	1853	No more periods, no weight gain (Actually I've been able to lose some).
21	1854	I have had significant weight gain over the last year or so but put it down to a more sedentary job, eating out and more regularly drinking wine.
21	1855	I haven't had any problems with weight gain.
21	1856	But as with Depo-Provera I have continued to not have a period and no weight gain for me.
21	1857	I thought this was all just due to my new postpartum life, but after reading others saying they gained weight I decided to get it out.
21	1858	However, on January 2018 is going to be a year with Mirena and I have notice gained weight, my belly looks different I feel bloated I don't feel slim and sexy like before.
21	1859	I gained 30 pounds.
21	1860	I've gained 60 pounds in 8 months!
21	1861	I gained about 50 pounds, grew depressed obviously.
21	1862	I was low in energy, didn't want to do much and I gained 25lbs in the last year.
21	1863	I had the Mirena for 2 years and gained 15lbs.
21	1864	All the weight I gained with Mirena seemed to go to my stomach.
21	1865	In 1 year, I've gained 60lbs with and w/o dieting.
21	1866	The reason I went the Mirena route was because I used to take the pill and then the NuvaRing ( I either got sick or gained 45lbs), after I didn't use anything at all.
21	1867	I was depressed, tired, gained 10lb and was always hungry, anxious 24/7, and sensitive to every little thing.

21	1971	I've gained 15 pounds, bloated every day, moody, etc.
21	1972	A couple days after insertion of mirena panic attacks began, also dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite.

21	1974	I lost my appetite from the abdominal pain and nausea.

21	1976	It was INCREDIBLY painful both times, nausea, nearly passing out.
21	1977	Hi I had the Mirena inserted 2 weeks ago it was inserted while I was undergoing another surgery so I was out under anesthetic when I woke I had really bad pain on my left side it went away after a few hours but still feel a little pain there every so often I've also experienced bloating nausea and daily  extreme tiredness every afternoon I hope it goes away soon

21	1982	I didn't even suspect the Mirena, then a few months ago I started having my period every other week, constant heartburn and nausea every morning, my breast became sore.
21	1983	I haven't really had any side effects besides nausea and slight bleeding.
21	1984	It really has good effects, but have a little nausea tonight.
21	1985	Being 26 years old and never having children, the insertion was extremely painful and I was very nauseous.
21	1986	The insertion was crazy painful, I felt nauseous and almost fainted, even though the doctors office told me I was fine to drive myself to and from the doctors office.
21	1987	after the procedure I did feel nauseous a  bit light headed on the way home but I didn't eat anything and took prescription pain killer.
21	1988	I felt nauseous afterwards and felt like I was gonna pass out during it.
21	1989	Extremely nauseous, dizzy.
21	1990	My initial experience was a little nauseous feeling (that came and went for a couple days), which was to be expected with the hormone change and honestly it was a little painful but I had to have a c-section.
21	1991	Unfortunately, it has made me feel nauseous practically everyday, my anxiety has gotten terrible.
21	1992	Afterwards I felt very hot, nauseous and dizzy for about an hour.
21	1993	The insertion was very painful - I could hardly catch my breath, and felt dizzy and nauseous afterwards.
21	1994	I was dizzy and nauseous.
21	1995	I nearly passed out from insertion, I was hyperventilating with a death grip on the assistant's hand and she had to sit with me for about 10 minutes afterwards while I ate a banana and drank water because I couldn't feel my face and was still dizzy.
21	1996	I have had a few hot flushes and been feeling really dizzy.
21	1997	I felt a little dizzy after, but was able to get up and drive home.
21	1998	I got dizzy and clammy and almost passed out.
21	1999	I quickly broke into a cold sweat, got very pale, so dizzy, and had terrible nause, my blood pressure also dropped extremely low.
21	2000	I could not move and felt dizzy and sick when this was happening.
21	2001	I've been light headed and dizzy.
21	2002	I felt dizzy for the 1st 20 minutes.
21	2003	Once it was done, I felt a little shakey and a little dizzy.
21	2004	It makes you have a very dizzy feeling right after but I drank some water and was fine.
21	2005	I was on the Nuvaring before and it made me dizzy.
21	2006	I do notice I have been a tad dizzy and sleeping a little less, i.e.
21	2007	Broke a cold sweat, got really dizzy, and really, really had to make a run for a bowel movement while still sweating and dizzy.
21	2008	I had to lay down for about 20 minutes on the table afterwords because I was dizzy.
21	2009	Cramping at first and slight dizziness afterwards.
21	2010	I had shortness of breath, dizziness, and would get light headed.
21	2011	I have not experienced dizziness or pain I could not handle, other that the day I got it.
21	2012	Previously I had Paragard Copper IUD and it was so horrendously irritating with uncomfortable acidic brown copper smelling discharge for the three months I had it in, and brought on severe panic attacks, anxiety, depression, and mood swings.
21	2013	Honestly have had enough, mood swings are awful, feeling faint and oily skin ever since!
21	2014	Terrible mood swings.
21	2015	Your mood swings are in your head.
21	2016	First 2 were great, no pain to get done, bled on/off for a couple of months then no bleeding for 5 years, no mood swings, perfect.
21	2017	I do have pretty extreme mood swings but they are getting better as I think the hormones are working themselves out!
21	2018	I have become increasingly aware that I have extreme mood swings more frequently.
21	2019	I just thought that I was depressed by life events but lately it has been more of a roller coaster of manic mood swings.
21	2020	I went online and read reviews and almost did not go through with it because even though there were some great reviews, the bad ones terrified me, especially because I had a lot of problems on multiple birth control pills before (depression, mood swings, sore breasts, etc).
21	2021	But I'm having it removed as soon as my husband gets a vasectomy because I am carrying around 15 extra pounds and my mood swings have been bad for all these years.
21	2022	I had mirena placed as an option to help my severe bipolar mood swings but I think this may not have been the right option for me.
21	2023	No mood swings, no anxiety, no depression.
21	2024	I love everything except the mood swings and anxiety.
21	2025	So my body tried to have a period, I experienced intense angry mood swings.
21	2026	Mood swings passed after first couple of days, now I am back to normal.
21	2027	My mood swings are so much better and I just decided to even exercise harder.
21	2028	I don't have anything bad to really say about Mirena, I don't have periods I don't have mood swings or any type of side effects when it was first put in I only lightly cramped that day and that was it.
21	2029	Mood swings, hot flashes, panic attacks, left arm swollen, insomnia, and too many more to count.
21	2030	I do notice slight mood swings and sleep heavier.
21	2031	I have noticed hair loss, increase in appetite, and mood swings.
21	2032	I thought I have been having some mood swings but I have a 7 month old so its hard to tell whats stressing me out.
21	2033	I started to gain weight almost immediately and my mood swings from anxiety to depression.
21	2034	Acne, horrible breast tenderness, tired, and mood swings.
21	2035	The mood swings were a surprise, I had been chalking it up to feel overwhelmed and frustrated all the time.
21	2036	From there on after had unpredictable bleeding and bad mood swings bloating all the time even still today.
21	2037	Husband now still feels the strings, depression, mood swings, get really tired all the time, bloated and feel as if I am pregnant all the time, getting it taken out.
21	2038	I did notice mild mood swings in the beginning but they went away and I have also lost weight.
21	2039	I have been having a lot of problems with my back, my mood swings and depression has taken a turn for the worst.
21	2040	My PMS has been horrific, mood swings, depression.
21	2041	I don't have mood swings, my mood is stuck on grumpy.
21	2042	I still suffer from side effects I have uncontrollable mood swings.
21	2043	I have mild mood swings nothing major.
21	2044	I no longer have the crazy mood swings that I had with the birth control pills.
21	2045	I have lost 14 pounds no mood swings.
21	2046	But, over a year I started to realize my major mood swings.
21	2047	Mood swings.
21	2048	I used to experience only mild mood swings.
21	2049	My periods are less frequent and less heavy, and I have fewer hormonal mood swings.
21	2050	I feel horrible and the mood swings are really bad.
21	2051	My mood swings are out of this world (my poor husband doesn't know if he should talk to me half the time).
21	2052	All they ever did was cause depression and mood swings.
21	2053	I have all sorts of mood swings and my husband says that I haven't really been the same since it was inserted.
21	2054	I have noticed that for about 2-3 weeks prior to my period, I go through major mood swings.
21	2055	I have had no weight or mood changes, period completely stopped after the three month bleeding and ever since I've nearly forgot about it.
21	2056	They also mentioned panic attacks, severe depression, and lack of energy... "mood changes" don't take if u already have anxiety issues!
21	2057	I haven’t noticed any mood changes.
21	2058	I was so nervous about my upcoming IUD insertion and after reading so many HORROR stories, including here on this site.
21	2059	After reading everything online I was very nervous about the insertion and I almost backed out last minute.
21	2060	I was nervous to get Mirena after reading reviews, but my doc strongly encouraged for medical reasons.
21	2061	I was nervous and so scared because of all the bad reviews I read about it before I went to have it put in.
21	2062	I was nervous about an IUD at first, but 8 months later and I absolutely love it.
21	2063	I was very nervous for the insertion but it ended up going really well.
21	2064	Pills are easy to forget and I would still get nervous about pregnancy while taking them.
21	2065	Really did not know what to expect and was very nervous about insertion.
21	2066	I was super nervous for my Mirena insertion and for no reason!
21	2067	I was very nervous to use the IDU, I have been on the pill for three years and never had a problem.
21	2068	I was very nervous because what I have read.
21	2069	I was nervous & scared from all the negative reviews I had read.
21	2070	After reading reviews I was beyond nervous having this done as everyone seems to think this is painful.
21	2071	I was nervous after reading reviews but decided I'd give it a shot anyway.
21	2072	I got the Mirena today, literally an hour ago, and let me just tell you exactly how nervous I was.
21	2073	Before I got it inserted, I took 2 advil and I was super nervous.
21	2074	I must admit that I was pretty horrified by some of the cringe-worthy reviews had seen, and I was very nervous going in today.
21	2075	After hearing all these crazy stories I am getting a little nervous about this.
21	2076	First i was nervous because of the reviews i reqd but mine was pretty quick, less than 5 minutes.
21	2077	I was nervous after reading all of the reviews.
21	2078	I got nervous and since I am a wuss I thought I was going to chicken out.
21	2079	I was pretty nervous going into it, and I'm not going to lie, insertion was pretty painful.
21	2080	Well I was nervous about the procedure, which was pretty painful but all I said was woah!
21	2081	I read the reviews and warnings and was nervous but agreed.
21	2082	I was really nervous about getting the Mirena because I've never had any children before and heard that the pain was awful.
21	2083	I am 20 years old, have a very small physique, and have never been pregnant so I was very nervous about insertion pain.
21	2084	After the first 6 months I didn't have my period at all, at first that made me nervous and I thought I was pregnant (I wasn't) but after I got used to it, not having a period was amazing.
21	2085	I was really nervous but it went fine.
21	2086	After giving birth I was looking for a birth control that would let me breast feed without any problems, my OB suggested Mirena which made me a bit nervous because of the mix reviews I read.
21	2087	I was so nervous to have it removed because with the first one it was pretty uncomfortable and I cramped up a little.
21	2088	I was a little nervous but I knew this was the right birth control for me.
21	2089	I was nervous about getting it put in since I've never had kids.
21	2090	I was so nervous to get it done but their is no way I can have another baby now.
21	2091	I was so nervous that morning because I had heard that it was so painful.
21	2092	I was very scared and nervous for the insertion, from having read many people saying it was extremely painful and/or uncomfortable.
21	2093	Pretty nervous now and hoping no side effects like used to be before having my kids.
21	2094	I'm 33 and married and I like many of you was very nervous about the Mirena.
21	2095	At first I was nervous because of the pain and it was pretty painful (not going to lie) but I had not taken any medication prior to getting inserted so that may have been a factor.
21	2096	I went in to get Mirena yesterday, and was very nervous after reading so many negative reviews about it hurting so bad for people that have never had children.
21	2097	I've read so many comments and really feel a bit nervous about the decision I made.
21	2098	Before I got my Mirena I did a lot of research and was so nervous... actually afraid to get it.
21	2099	When I first got it inserted I was a bit nervous because I was told that it was a little painful.
21	2100	We were very nervous, I was using the Mirena because of severe possibility of birth defects with medications I was taking.
21	2101	I have to say that I was pretty nervous after reading so many bad comments.
21	2102	Just had to put the comment in here that the reviews posted had me extremely nervous about the insertion and while I cannot express my opinion about this device long term the insertion did not hurt AT ALL.
21	2103	I was nervous but felt nothing.
21	2104	Anyways all was fine for the first week then exactly 1 week later ( and nothing else in my life changed) I started to get manic, anxious and felt like I was running away from danger all the time.
21	2105	I was super anxious all the time, had sleepless nights, bleed the whole time, and had no appetite.
21	2106	I'd been scared and anxious for days!
21	2107	I was feeling anxious about having sex with my boyfriend because I was worried it may hurt but surprisingly there was no pain!
21	2108	I am really anxious to see how my Mirena works!
21	2109	I eventually worked out that my anxiety was linked to it!
21	2110	I had zero history of anxiety or depression.
21	2111	Developed GAD and anxiety disorders half a year in and started crying for no reason at everything and had to see a therapist twice.
21	2112	Had a cyst rupture the other day and anxiety is getting pretty bad again but I tolerate it.
21	2113	My anxiety definitely made the insertion process worse, so try to relax.
21	2114	I also experienced moodiness, hair thinning, and my anxiety increased.
21	2115	Then the depression, anxiety, and panic attacks hit.
21	2116	My husband and I recently moved across country so I thought for sure my hair loss and anxiety of a new place was due to the stress of moving.
21	2117	I have a history of anxiety, but it was under control.
21	2118	However, around 4 months after insertion I began to have severe anxiety.
21	2119	All my symptoms were in line anxiety and depression disorders (which I don't have).
21	2120	I was given a diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder & prescribed medication for depression however I feel it is all side effects of the coil.
21	2121	I had an anxiety attack going in, I was so scared to get it.
21	2122	I was legitimately having anxiety because of all of the horror stories of insertion.
21	2123	I suffer from depression but ever since I got the Mirena it has gotten worse and my anxiety attacks keep coming and coming.
21	2124	I passed out after the insertion, probably due to my anxiety over the needle, and was in a lot of pain for the rest of the day and threw up twice.
21	2125	The only downside was at about a year in I started to get very depressed and have anxiety attacks.
21	2126	However, about 6 months after insertion, I began experiencing major anxiety issues, panic attacks, etc.
21	2127	I've never had anxiety issues before so I was confused.
21	2128	Until recently, I hadn't put my anxiety and Mirena together, but after reading so many reviews about anxiety problems with Mirena, I'm some-what forced to consider the removal of Mirena.
21	2129	There are no other logical explanations other than the hormone release that is causing my anxiety, which has become extremely difficult to deal with on a daily basis.
21	2130	I get depressed easy and my anxiety has got worse.
21	2131	I have anxiety attacks over pretty much anything.
21	2132	I began having extreme anxiety which is strange for me because I am have never been the type.
21	2133	It has now been three weeks since removal and my anxiety has reduced greatly.
21	2134	Trust me the anxiety of getting it is the worst part.
21	2135	Lately, I have had anxiety, which I never used to have and begun having panic attacks.
21	2136	I have been experiencing anxiety the last 6 months and I have no idea why and seems to be getting worse, I have seen my ob and family doctor and they said I should have no side affect like this (anxiety).
21	2137	After 2 months of bleeding it FINALLY went away but I then began having major anxiety.
21	2138	Also I have experienced anxiety and loss of energy.
21	2139	I'm depressed I now have anxiety attacks.
21	2140	The only thing I am worried about is anxiety.
21	2141	I've been dealing with anxiety since what seems like when I had it put in.
21	2142	Every once and a while I will get the breast tenderness, but it's not much worse then when I was breastfeeding and often goes away in minutes.
21	2143	The 14 day periods, tender breasts and stabbing pains, I could have coped with until it settled; but the anger out of nowhere, falling out with family and my partner, irrational crying, feeling totally emotionally unbalanced and actually hating who I'd become were horrific.
21	2144	Acne during period and some tender breasts.
21	2145	My feet and hands are swollen with achy joints, tender breasts and lower back pain.
21	2146	Breasts hurt like anything but so far definitely worth it!
21	2147	Breasts hurt.
21	2148	This is my 3rd yeast infection in a month, maybe 5th or 6th since May.
21	2149	One thing though, the antibiotics they put you on day of insertion did give me a Yeast Infection.
21	2150	I now have my period 2 times a month, and if I'm not on my period, I have a yeast infection.
21	2151	I did get an yeast infection from the strings but Monistat took care of that.
21	2152	I was told it was yeast infection.
21	2153	Yeast infections too.
21	2154	I got my first BV infections, and the worst yeast infections.
21	2155	Then I started getting very mild yeast infections.
21	2156	I have only had yeast infections in the past while on antibiotics and they would go away without treatment.
21	2157	I've been getting yeast infections and I never had one before this
21	2158	I had 12 yeast infections, 1 E coli infection.
21	2159	About a year and a month in I started having yeast infections 2-3 times a month every month.
21	2160	Yeast infections.
21	2161	As told, the bleeding and pain eventually stopped but yeast infections, feminine odor, discharge and dryness became regular.
21	2162	I also suffered from constant yeast infections, my doctor said it was worth a go otherwise I would have to rely just on condoms.
21	2163	I feel like I am always moist and have suffered from yeast infections.
22	1	I had irregular periods since I started having my period, I also had terrible acne and nasty cramps.
22	2	After taking MonoNessa, my acne went away, with the exception of the occasional blackheads, I have absolutely no cramps while on my period, and I get my period every month for 3-4 days.
22	3	Doesn't really help my acne either.
22	4	I switched to this BC based on the recommendation from my Dr; I was looking for a contraceptive that would help with my acne.
22	5	Considering I got this for my acne, I've only noticed a slight difference, but that may also be due to other changes I have made.
22	6	I started to get acne all over my face.
22	7	I've been on this pill for about 4 months now and at first it was great, it cleared up my acne and everything went fine, then I accidentally missed a pill and since then my face has been all full of acne.
22	8	I did make my acne fade and I didn't gain any weight the only sort of bad thing is that my bra size increased by a cup.
22	9	It got rid of all of my acne and made my periods regular.
22	10	I'm not one to breakout and suddenly I have acne.
22	11	Only con is that I do break out a lot when it's time to take the 7 inactive pills but once I start the active pills my acne clears & it's also cleared all my back acne!
22	12	Have had a lot less energy, an out break of acne on my back, which is strange because hormonal bc is supposed to help with that.
22	13	[Pros] I had bad acne and it has helped clear it up, periods are less painful .
22	14	I'll also mentioned that I suffered from incredibly bad acne a few years ago, and I was nervous that starting birth control would ruin my skin again.
22	15	Since starting the pill, I haven't noticed any improvement in my skin nor have I noticed any worsening of my acne.
22	16	I recently was put on a body acne medication that lowered the effectiveness of this brand so because of that reason I am switching to Zovia I hope it's as good.
22	17	I went on this pill an entire year ago to help control my facial acne.
22	18	(the acne would be worse, then get better) Well, I can say that I've given it a full year trial... and my acne has gotten lighter, but I still break out terribly.
22	19	I never had severe acne just mild.
22	20	Lingering acne on my face has also vanished.
22	21	I also got very hungry at night, just figured I'd push through and all the symptoms went away after a month except the acne.
22	22	Like a psychotic to my husband, and my acne was horrible.
22	23	Some other pills I tried (can't remember names because there were probably 3 different kinds) worsened my acne or made me have crazy mood swings.
22	24	One of the main reasons I am on birth control is for acne this pill has cleared up my face.
22	25	My acne has been clearing up.
22	26	It cleared my acne after my first months dose
22	27	My skin has cleared up with no acne.
22	28	My acne actually got better, but only slightly and that could be due to other factors.
22	29	I told have as much acne.
22	30	Cleared up my acne.
22	31	However, on a positive note, it has cleared up my acne and I am loving that.
22	32	My acne before and after my period is horrendous.
22	33	I have acne, but I had acne as a teenager, and then it went away and came back years later, so I don't think the birth control is the culprit.
22	34	I wanted birth control to regulate things and clear my hormonal acne.
22	35	My acne is cleared just left over marks healing.
22	36	Been taking it for just 1 month, I had to change my other birth control because of mood swings and acne.
22	37	My acne got better and my mood swings are better but I'm always hungry now and weirdly enough I smell differently and I sweat more than usual.
22	38	Only reason I give it a 9 instead of 10  is I feel like my acne is a little worse around my chin area :/
22	39	Mononessa has cleared up my moderate to severe acne in just one month!
22	40	It is truly a miracle as I have tried literally EVERYTHING to get rid of acne.
22	41	I have pretty bad acne, it hasn't really helped.
22	42	Within few days of taking the pill my acne cleared up.
22	43	Is a shame that side effects are so undesirable since it does work for my acne.
22	44	I'm a healthy 28 year old who doesn't smoke or drink and it caused me to constantly feel nauseous that's the main reason I decided to switch to something else and even when I would take it at 10pm I was still nauseous all day, I started breaking out a lot but my skin would clear up completely once I would take the inactive pills, I was also extremely hungry all the time and once I would start the inactive pills I would have my usual apetite back again.
22	45	I'm breaking out in places I never have before and wake up every morning with new white heads and black heads.
22	46	These random pimples are on my back too!
22	47	I was a little worried about taking it because of the bad reviews on here but the only side effects I've noticed are a little bit of dizziness in the first week or so that I start a new pack nothing sitting breathing deeply and drinking water can't fix... (also occurs mostly when I'm hungry) my sense of smell is heightened, I would mention some weight gain butttt I've had some changes in my life while beginning birth control that can contribute to that one being a worse diet annnnd the weight gain is not big my pants fit a tighter that's all..everything else is normal pimples here and there light-med.
22	48	I had a little bit of breakouts on my chin, and it has gone away already, but that could also be attributed to just the fact that pimples go away with time.
22	49	It has worked incredibly well for me, and I rarely ever get pimples.
22	50	I started it because I have endometriosis and the cramps are unbearable.
22	51	My periods came twice a month, & sometimes not at all for 3 to 6 months, & they always lasted 8-10 days with severe cramps, large blood clots, severe mood swings, rendering me bedridden.
22	52	4-5 days, hardly any cramps, better moods, I haven't got pregnant & i don't use condoms I'm in a monogamous relationship.
22	53	The following weeks went by and my headache got worse by the time my period came I experienced cramps very bad cramps making me cry (30 year old crying worst period ever) I called my doctor and told her my symptoms she told me that it was normal that eventually my body would get use to the medication.
22	54	Some months I would experience cramps, or breast tenderness that I never had before being on it.
22	55	I have always had cramps & Mononessa did not help with those either.
22	56	No  bad side effects for me , helps clear my skin, and less leg cramps too, glad I found the right pill for me
22	57	Then months 4-6 I had spotting, break through bleeding, and cramps, sometimes crazy discharge sometimes I was super dry, terrible mood swings, etc.)
22	58	My period does last 5 days but my cramps aren't as bad nor is my period nearly as heavy as when I wasn't on birth control.
22	59	I had cramps during it all and my doc told me to the 800mg of  ibuprofen 3x a day to stop the bleeding.
22	60	I was prescribed it when I was 18 and had been having awful cramps and nausea during my period, as well as it being irregular.
22	61	Breast tenderness, cramps, headaches, dizziness, and even a two-week long period for the first two weeks.
22	62	I used to have extremely painful cramps on the first two days of my period, but that pain has dramatically decreased since taking this pill.
22	63	While I was on the pill: PROS: no break-outs, mild cramps, no heavy periods just spotting, bloating disappeared
22	64	Started this pill in Apr 2016 it was okay at first, periods became lighter, the cramps were unbearable.
22	65	I rarely have skin breakouts, my cramps used to be awful but now hardly have them if any at all.
22	66	When I started Mononessa a year ago, the first month I had headaches and cramps, but they went away after 1 cycle.
22	67	On the plus side, however, my period cramps are now nonexistent.
22	68	I have no pain or cramps (I didn't have major cramps when I wasn't using BC however).
22	69	Period's are pretty normal, cramps are kept to a minimum.
22	70	Got rid of my bad cramps.
22	71	On the upside, my period went from being so painful I couldn't function to pretty light and barely any cramps.
22	72	Off of the pill, my periods were 9-11 days, came every 1-3 months, extremely heavy and with terrible cramps, to the point that I would miss class/work due to vomiting from the pain.
22	73	It has definitely decreased my cramps and pain as that was the original reason I was put on birth control.
22	74	I have experienced no nausea, and no cramps.
22	75	My periods used to be absolutely horrible (dreadful cramps and heavy bleeding) now they're not bad at all!
22	76	I only had minor cramps on the first day.
22	77	After years of having awful period cramps to the point of the first 3 days of it starting I always had to call out of work because I could not do a thing but lay down.
22	78	Very light bleeding and almost hard to tell cramps.
22	79	I used to have extremely painful cramps, I would have to miss work and school because I was in so much pain, and  Mononessa has definitely helped.
22	80	At first it didn't seem to help with the cramps so I went back to my doctor and she uped my dosage.
22	81	1mg of mononess and three days of taking it made me cramp daily and painfully.
22	82	I had extremely heavy and irregular periods with unbearable cramping for years.
22	83	I've been taking Mononessa for about 3 years now, have never gotten pregnant, and have little to barely any cramping, along with regular, once-a-month, periods.
22	84	Unbearable stomach/pelvic cramping to the point where I couldn't even sit up straight, headaches, complete loss of energy, crazy mood swings, loss of appetite/being disgusted by foods I normally love, and terrible nausea at all hours of the day, and very painful breast tenderness starting at the beginning of the 2nd week.
22	85	Since I started this birth control I have only had minimal cramping and have never been sick from my period again.
22	86	Ever since I started taking this birth control I have periods that last about 3 weeks with cramping and headaches...
22	87	A month into it and on my period I had to take days off work because the cramping was distracting and unbearable.
22	88	Now, my periods last 3-4 days, I only use light tampons, I have very little cramping, have not gained a pound, and I've never had a pregnancy scare since starting it.
22	89	Light flow and little cramping first day.
22	90	This pill was fine for the first three months that I was on it, then I started constantly spotting.
22	91	I only had 3-4 days a month that I was not spotting while on this med.
22	92	I was switched to Lo Loesterin and the spotting has stopped.
22	93	Only positive I can say is that I had no spotting in between periods, my periods were the exact same light and fast, no weight gain.
22	94	It dipped in and out of heavy bleeding, but was always heavier than typical spotting.
22	95	CONS: Occasional light spotting with a small breakout a week or so before period.
22	96	It's not even spotting, it's just a full-on period for five months.
22	97	I've even missed a pill here and there, and I have experienced no spotting or anything abnormal.
22	98	After that though it went away, the first time I got my period with it was a few days after the placebo pills and so far its basically just spotting...hope this is normal because i am sexually active.
22	99	However it gave me terrible mood swings, spotting, and the final straw was my once thick hair became extremely thin.
22	100	I did spot occasionally but not too often.
22	101	I did spot more than normal in the first month or two, however I am now 18 months in and like it very much.
22	102	I tried Yaz before this one and I spotted for a whole month.
22	103	I’ve been taking mononessa for a month and a half, since day one I noticed a slight headache I didn’t pay much attention to it since I thought it was just balancing my hormones.
22	104	Once again I’m on month two second week I’ve been experiencing terrible heart burn, diarrhea, vomiting & extreme headache so I threw them away.
22	105	The day after I switched pills I had a dull headache and slight nausea.
22	106	Every time I took the pill, regardless of the fact that I'd taken it on a full stomach, I would get a debilitating headache and nausea.
22	107	Yesterday and today I have had a constant headache, which I'm assuming is coming from the pills becsude I don't get frequent headaches.
22	108	Sometimes I get these very weird headaches , its almost as if I'm dehydrated .
22	109	A few days after I started taking the pills I got very nauseous and had horrible headaches daily
22	110	Terrible cravings, bloating, headaches, etc.
22	111	Very moody, tired,headaches, dry skin, and now four months in my period was late.
22	112	Constant nausea, stomach pains, hot flashes, headaches, insomnia, weight gain, bloated, the only positive it gave me was a lighter period but it wasn't worth it with all the side affects.
22	113	I was on this pill for three days and thought I would die.Severe nausea, nightmares, mood swings, insomnia,headaches and chest pain.
22	114	I experienced little nausea/ headaches and no swelling.
22	115	Nausea, headaches, aches, and depression.
22	116	Never felt sick and no headaches at all and no weight gain.
22	117	With this product I experience breast tenderness, drowsiness, headaches, and for the first month I was constantly nauseous.
22	118	No nausea, or headaches.
22	119	I have been taking it to prevent pregnancy since I had my baby and so far it's been really good...hardly any side effects at all...only thing  I don't like is I'm a little more moody and get headaches sometimes but for having a period every other month now I'm right on time every month..I recommend it
22	120	After 2 years my periods are still irregular, I experience recurring  headaches, and I'm constantly bloated and have gained 10 pounds.
22	121	I had what felt like non-stop migraines, my anxiety was on a different level (I kept thinking I was suffering from DVT and was having mini panic attacks) I had weird palpitations when working out and I had a lot of trouble staying asleep.
22	122	Starting on the first month, on day 3 of taking the pill I started having INTENSE migraines & also vomiting a lot every single day for about 2 weeks.
22	123	Month 2 of the pack came & again from day 3 for about 2 weeks I was so weak I couldn't leave my bed, my migraines got worse making my vision blurry and intense vomiting.
22	124	The first month or so, I remember having some nausea, but  I noticed for the first year, a significant drop in my sex drive and depression issues.
22	125	After the 4th year of taking it, my body got used to Yaz and now I am experiencing a lot of mood swings and my sex drive decreasing!
22	126	I did gain about 25 pounds and had a much lower sex drive though.
22	127	My sex drive went up incredibly.
22	128	This pill actually made my sex drive increase, and it does its job well.
22	129	Dropped my sex drive significantly, but the hardest thing to manage is obsession with food; the amount I'm eating, binge eating, and craving high fats, carbs and sugars.
22	130	My appetite has gone up, my sex drive has gone down just a bit but not to the point where I was worried about it.
22	131	[cons] I have gained a few pounds and am constantly craving food, my sex drive is substantial lower.
22	132	I have noticed my sex drive go down, but not so far down that I have no desire.
22	133	The only thing is, I think it negatively effects my mood and sex drive.
22	134	Since taking Monessa the only problem I have had was an increase in appetite and not having a sex drive PERIOD.
22	135	I feel like crying every minute and not to mention that but my sex drive is completely gone.
22	136	Moody(which Im not at all), gained 15lbs, always bloated, foods I should want and love made me sick,no sex drive, horrible periods, lethargic etc etc.
22	137	My sex drive isn't horrible but it has decreased for sure.
22	138	Also my sex drive never went down so that's awesome.
22	139	But after like a couple weeks use I lost sex drive and was getting really bad UTI's almost everyday.
22	140	Right away I noticed the biggest change in my lifestyle: my sex drive plummeted and I became extremely emotional.
22	141	I've noticed there's more vaginal discharge but my sex drive is pretty low.
22	142	The first few months taking it, my sex drive plummeted.
22	143	The only side effects I have had are being extremely tired, high sex drive, vaginal dryness, and a slight decrease in appetite.
22	144	Not to mention moodiness, feeling foggy, and decreased libido.
22	145	I was experiencing serious weight gain from sprintec and finally made the switch to mononessa.
22	146	No mood swings, no vomiting, no nausea, no weight gain (I do workout most days of the week), no fatigue, no cravings,  like I said I'm one of the lucky ones.
22	147	No weight gain, feelings of depression, or pregnancy.
22	148	I can't say the weight gain is completely from the birth control, but I think it has mostly come from me switching.
22	149	And I have noticed I am darker skin tone since I've been on this pill (tan with out tanning, this is a plus and this is a listed side effect) no weight gain.
22	150	Craved unhealthy foods which I did not partake in, so no weight gain.
22	151	I haven't experienced any weight gain or cravings (I've always eaten a lot though so it's hard to tell!).
22	152	No weight gain, no hormonal changes, no unexpected pregnancies!
22	153	Cons.. (Well, my only MAJOR con) is WEIGHT GAIN!!!!
22	154	Contraceptive side of Mononessa is good but the weight gain is NO GO!!
22	155	Great pill, no mood swings, no weight gain.
22	156	I have noticed weight gain and I am constantly bloated!
22	157	I haven't experienced weight gain, but a weight loss of 3 pants sizes.
22	158	Weight gain within days of starting with this birth control and bloated.
22	159	I have been bleeding for 2 weeks, gained 4 pounds and I'm only on my second pack.
22	160	I have gained about 5 pounds in the past year.
22	161	Breasts were sore everyday, gained 20 pounds, cried over everything, nothing good happened except I didn't get pregnant.
22	162	I started to take Mononessa on the first day of my period and I bleed for 3 weeks, got really nauseous for a week and gained 3 pounds in 3 weeks.
22	163	I have gained a few extra pounds, but I've managed most of it with diet and exercise.
22	164	I used to get the Depo-Shot and I gained almost 30 lbs from that (I know).
22	165	I also gained a lot of weight since starting Mononessa, and always feel tired and foggy.
22	166	I haven't gained any weight from it.
22	167	Haven't gained weight.
22	168	I have been taking it for 2 years and have gained 15 pounds and constantly look bloated.
22	169	I also haven't gained any weight.
22	170	I have gained 20 pounds over the time I have taken it.
22	171	It made me sick all the time I gained 15lbs if not more and stay bloated.
22	172	Every time I step on the scale I've gained another 2-3lbs.
22	173	I don't even eat a lot & have never gained weight this rapidly in my life.
22	174	So far I've gained 13lbs since starting this pill..
22	175	At first I didn't really notice anything, but recently I have realized that I have gained a couple pounds, even though I work out 5 times a week and eat relatively healthy.
22	176	On the other hand I have gained 4 pounds out of nowhere.
22	177	Been on this birth control over a year now and I gained so much weight.
22	178	This month I couldn't even get out of bed I experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, back pain, dizziness, weakness.
22	179	Caused a heavy increase in appetite around 5 days after I started taking it along with very bad nausea, super painful breast tenderness, extreme bloating and made me feel  depressed.
22	180	I had a little nausea when I first began taking them, but it went away after a month or so.
22	181	It seems like I'm finally experiencing the nausea side effect that almost everyone mentioned, but I somewhat expected it and it's not a huge deal.
22	182	All I can say is terrible nausea!
22	183	The first two to three months my body was adjusting to the change which caused nausea and mood swings but afterwards I was back to normal.
22	184	I've been taking it for a good while now, the first three months I was dizzy, nausea, and moody.
22	185	I've had many side effects such as the nausea or throwing up.
22	186	I didn't really experience any negative side effects- a few weird waves of nausea early on, but other than that, I felt really good on this pill.
22	187	I have only mild symptoms from time to time such as nausea but nothing horrible.
22	188	I have had no mood swings, weight loss/gain, nausea, etc.
22	189	Aside from the horrible nausea I have gotten, this pill is very effective and the time window is 2 hours but I have taken it 5 hours later a few times and had no problem I also have unprotected sex regularly.
22	190	Severe nausea and multiple near-puke experiences.
22	191	I liked this one,  it sucks that the doctor switched my birth control pills to something else right when I had stopped getting the overbearing, chronic nausea.
22	192	Maybe try an anti nausea medication with it until the first month is over.
22	193	First 2 months I had nausea for a while.
22	194	Later that night, I experienced the nausea again and it quickly progressed to violent vomiting.
22	195	I knew there was going to be a little nausea at first, and yes, t was bad.
22	196	Cons: severe nausea & vomiting, couldn't eat right for months, my normally short periods became long.
22	197	If you are still dealing with nausea well into the second month, consider changing medications.
22	198	At first I was experiencing nausea for 5 days then it went away.
22	199	However, the nausea was so bad.
22	200	When I first began taking it I did experience some nausea that went away after a week.
22	201	The first week of taking this pill I experienced nausea EVERY SINGLE DAY directly after taking the pill, it got a little worse while I was driving, which didn't help since I already had car sickness problems.
22	202	The very first 3 days of taking Mononessa I always feel very nauseated.
22	203	I woke up at 4 am the second day throwing up but ever since then I haven't been nauseated.
22	204	Feel bloated, nauseated.
22	205	I am very irritable and extremely nauseated.
22	206	In the beginning this contraceptive made me nauseated every single day, which was irritating.
22	207	I thought I was pregnant, I was nauseous, throwing up, extremely exhausted, dizzy, and hot flashes.
22	208	I started taking these pills and within three days I started getting nauseous and I couldn't stop vomiting.
22	209	When I first started taking the pill, I was very hormonal and nauseous but once a month or so kicked in, everything was fine.
22	210	I was nauseous for the first few months only after starting a new pack but now I never am.
22	211	The entire first month I was slightly nauseous all day and extremely tired, sore throat, and head ache.
22	212	I literally felt nauseous when I took the second pack I had i fever , my body felt weak and constantly threw up ..
22	213	If you feel nauseous,  wait it out.
22	214	IT CAN make you nauseous...but the trick is to eat a lot with it.
22	215	Within just a period of a couple days, I was nauseous, dizzy, it gave me diarrhea, and it made me irritable and tired.
22	216	MonoNessa isn’t totally horrible, some moments I’m fine and others I'm super dizzy.
22	217	I couldn't control myself and was shaking and extremely dizzy and it felt as if the world was going to end.
22	218	I've been taking this pill for months now & I always feel dizzy and lightheaded in the mornings.
22	219	My anxiety spiked, dizziness, and I feel at times I'm going to faint.
22	220	No crazy mood swings or bad side effects.
22	221	This birth control seemed fine at first, but 10 days into it I started feeling not like myself--bad mood swings, feeling breathless or winded even when sitting, my blood pressure would spike for no reason, and I felt extremely sluggish.
22	222	2 weeks after I began my mood swings increased a lot, it was really unpredictable what my mood will be like.
22	223	My face is normally clear, weight is normal, mood swings low, periods normal to light.
22	224	Also I don't have mood swings or cry a lot like other people say they do.
22	225	This birth control works and does its job, it's just the mood swings that have been terrible for me.
22	226	I just feel like the mood swings outweigh the benefits and I just want to feel better.
22	227	Mood swings aren't that bad.
22	228	I don't have cravings from it but sometimes I have depressive mood swings.
22	229	My mood swings were out of control and I'm a pretty chill person.
22	230	I would rate it a 9/10 because of the mood swings!
22	231	I don't have nearly as many crazy mood swings on this pill as I have on others and it seems to be a very effective contraceptive (even if I forget to take it and have to play catch-up every once in a while).
22	232	I was pretty nervous with all the mixed reviews I read before taking it, especially because I experienced no side effects with Zarah.
22	233	I was nervous to get on this pill because of the reviews but I started anyways.
22	234	I feel happier and less anxious.
22	235	On the fourth month of use,  I experienced extreme anxiety and depression.
22	236	My previous bc made me hormonal and emotional, as in all of my emotions were on the extremes and I also experienced heightened anxiety and depression.
22	237	After switching to this brand I saw an evening out of my emotions and anxiety gradually as my body got used to the switch.
22	238	It also made me gain weight and increased my anxiety and depression.
22	239	Depression and anxiety gets really bad for 1-2 days and I started vomiting.
22	240	I was most concerned about mood changes/depression when beginning this pill, as the last BC I was on built upon my already-existing anxiety and depression.
22	241	I have moderate anxiety disorder, and after a week of being on this pill, I had severe panic attacks.
22	242	I always get sick after anxiety attacks but that one was the worst.
22	243	My mood is crazy but at the same time i have anxiety problems which I take a low dose of medication for and I went through middle school-currently college on this stuff so I think overall it's not the medication, it's me haha.
22	244	At times I will get tender breasts.
22	245	My doctor had to prescribe me a prescription strength bacteria pill to take for 10 days and a prescription strength yeast infection pill for 8 days.
22	246	It’s was amazing the first time I took it but after I was dying with constant yeast infection do not take
22	247	It was effective for that purpose but I kept having repeat yeast infections & bacterial vaginitis.
22	248	However, since I've been on it I have experienced yeast infections and urinary tract infections much more often than usual but I'm unsure if that is the Pill or change in sexual habits.
23	1	I was on the pill before getting the implant which completely cleared up my acne, but after getting the implant (which is progestin only) my acne came back.
23	2	If you are concerned about acne, consider a birth control method that has estrogen.
23	3	Nexplanon caused me to get acne on my chest and back and spots on my face which the pill always helped control.
23	4	I also get very bad acne, that I never use to have.
23	5	The only issue I had was the weight gain, acne , and mood swings.
23	6	From acne, to weight gain, to the length of each period, I can’t take it anymore.
23	7	I lost about 10lbs on the almost 3 months I was on it and never had an issue with acne.
23	8	I would say my weight and acne haven't been affected.
23	9	The negatives: Around the time I'm assuming is suppose to be my period, the implant becomes tender, acne (its minimal but frequent) and because I don't get a period I do fear pregnancy but amazon has bulk stripe test so I'm good there.
23	10	I don't get acne or any of the other side effects that some people experience.
23	11	I got mine inserted a little over a year ago, and I was prepared to deal with acne, weight-gain, irregular bleeding and hormones.
23	12	As far as my weight I gained some (actually very little) but I don’t think it was the birth control itself and I didn’t have any abnormal acne.
23	13	I have had TERRIBLE mood swings and TERRIBLE acne !
23	14	I didn't get acne or weight loss/gain.
23	15	My acne had been bad from previous birth control options and nexplanon wasn't in effect for helping to clear it up, as it got worse.
23	16	I have been having very abnormal periods as well as terrible acne.
23	17	At first, I thought my acne was due to my diet.
23	18	I tried different acne skincare lines,  changing my sheets every few days, keeping my hands away from my face, and cleaning my makeup brushes religiously.
23	19	Nothing changed after I made these changes, my acne seemed to be getting much worse.
23	20	In a year I went from 120 pounds to 180lb, my face was always covered in acne, and I had ridiculous mood swings.
23	21	Experienced lots of hair loss (now have weird bangs from hair growing back), constantly on my period/spotting, although sometimes I get a month or 2 break (not worth 2 month long periods), and bad acne (never had acne before).
23	22	I also got acne on my face during the first 3 months which became embarrassing but it went away and I have not had problems that involve nexplanon since (when I do break out, it’s usually stress).
23	23	I got bad acne when I never experienced this, my face has always been clear and acne free.
23	24	So basically this birth control is good for not getting pregnant but mean while you will gain weight, get acne, bleed a lot in the beginning and lose A LOT of hair.
23	25	Other physical effects that have been harsher are a ridiculous appetite, acne, sweating (overall being hotter), skin darkening, and migraines.
23	26	While on this birth control I had terrible acne all over my back, face and neck.
23	27	On top of the acne I looked really bloated and had gained close to 10 pounds.
23	28	I got the worst acne of my life honestly so bad and had literally zero sex drive so there was no point for this thing.
23	29	My skin is the worst it’s ever been, I’ve suffered from acne since I was young and it was finally clearing up with the right skin care routine!
23	30	I experienced bad mood swings with this birth control as well as changes in appetite, weight gain, acne, and random bleeding.
23	31	First had the implant when I was 24, it was great, lost weight, periods lighter and less painful, bit of acne but I've always had that.
23	32	Right off the bat I felt it was great up until I started noticing the gain weight, terrible acne, fatigue.
23	33	Into the third year I have uncontrollably weight gain despite exercise and diet, deep facial acne, migraines that I never had before the neiplanon, I feel full and bloated all the time, acid reflux daily, and stomach pains.
23	34	No cramps, spotting or acne.
23	35	No weight gain, acne, or mood swings.
23	36	I have had period , after period, after period and they last about 2 weeks.. no sex drive, headaches, acne, mood swings like no other.
23	37	And the acne.
23	38	Yes I'm getting acne, mood swings, appetite changes, libido changes...sore throat and flu like symptoms.
23	39	Then the flood gates let loose and I started having 2 week periods with hormone fluxes, hot flashes, weight gain and acne.
23	40	Also experienced the same nasty side effects as so many others... weight gain, hormones, acne, migraines, fatigue, and complete loss of libido.
23	41	I have lost weight but kept it in the good spots ;) I have no problems with headaches, moodiness, dryness, increased acne etc.
23	42	I have horrible acne, migraines, mood swings, weight gain and NO sex drive This thing is ruining my marriage!
23	43	Then it all got much worst my face is full of acne that I've never ever had this bad, I'm more depressed then ever with almost constant mood swings, I have no drive, constantly fatigued I can't wait to get this thing out & get a non hormonal BC!
23	44	The good: improved the severity of my cramps, lessened the frequency of my periods, didn't get any mood swings or acne side effects, very convenient, don't have to remember to take a pill, didn't hurt putting it in, lasts 3 years
23	45	I have bad acne which isn't really new, but still inconvenient.
23	46	But the 2nd time I got extreme acne and acne scaring.
23	47	I have severe acne now and didn't before and I am up almost 60 lbs from my post birth weight with my daughter (80 lbs from my pre pregnancy weight).
23	48	I notice an increase in back acne but face acne there are no differences.
23	49	I didn't get my period which was great because I always got really bad migraines on my period and those stopped, didn't really experience acne and I actually lost 20 pounds which was fantastic.
23	50	It is now August and I am starting to gain weight, am left with acne and acne scars and have been experience bleeding for a few weeks now which is a huge pain.
23	51	I had been on the microgestin pill for about 5 years prior to trying this - microgestin had worked really well and helped clear my body and face acne significantly.
23	52	I tried it for a year and in that time I gained 20 pounds, was left with acne scars, continuously had acne on my face and back, periods would last up to three weeks, I would go months without a period, major mood swings; including crying for no reason, being mad for no reason, feeling depressed etc.
23	53	A little increase in acne, and 5 day periods turned into light bleeding for 2 weeks per month which is a price I'd willingly pay for peace of mind.
23	54	The first couple of months  was good, but  after that I have increased acne and heavy spotting.
23	55	The WORST birth control ever I've had it for almost a year and is scheduled on Monday 07/17/17 to have it taken out it was okay first, but now I have HORRIBLE headaches and sometimes bad chest pains, bad depression, weight gain, and the WORST anxiety , and terrible acne, I wouldn't recommend this birth control to anybody
23	56	It caused acne and horrible migraines.
23	57	After about a week I started breaking out with acne.
23	58	I have chronic acne but my acne has minimized since being on nexplanon, so that my upside at this time~
23	59	The negatives are lower sex drive, acne on the arm by the injection site, hair growing in places it had not before ( my chin).
23	60	I've put on weight but the acne is non stop.
23	61	No acne, no weight gain (well, there is weight gain but it is from diet!
23	62	I got really bad acne during my pregnancy .
23	63	After I had my son my acne was clearing up, but this birth control made me break out.
23	64	I feel so bad for my husband but dang he is a trooper lol I've  always kind of had acne but it's been worse since I've been on it.
23	65	Pros: Didn't getting pregnant, no periods, no acne Cons: major weight gain.
23	66	I never had acne in my life and now I get major breakouts and my back now has bacne!!
23	67	I was depressed all of the time, sore boobs, feeling fluttering pregnancy movements in my belly, acne all of the time and I had a very heavy 8 wk long period before I had enough.
23	68	I started to experience extreme mood swings, fatigue, depression, acne and those are just a few things.
23	69	My only complaint is I had some hormonal acne flare ups when I first got the implant, but they didn't last long.
23	70	I have only been on it a few months but I have had no symptoms (besides some headaches and increase in acne the first few weeks).
23	71	I have no acne or appetite issues.
23	72	I did have a bit of acne the first few weeks after getting it but it cleared up.
23	73	No weight gain, no increase in acne.
23	74	I went from perfect skin to oily, acne infested skin in a month!
23	75	I lost a lot of confidence because of my acne prone skin.
23	76	I wanted off depo because I had no sex drive, thinning hair, and bad bad acne.
23	77	Since switching my hair is getting thicker, my sex drive has gone through the roof, and my acne has settled down.
23	78	I haven't had bad acne as others have stated.
23	79	The nexplanon is plain awful I'm on my third year a month from getting it taken out (I've been begging my doc to take it out for a year now and just got OK'ed) the first year of it my period was nuts either no period or month long period slight weight gain but nothing terrible second year mood swings like crazy weight gain and acne.
23	80	Third year has been the worst I have no acne constant mood swing severe depression despite my life going well can't stop gaining weight (130lb before 185lb now) bloating cramps are so bad I've had to miss work I have acne on my back and face and weird hair growth.
23	81	I also suffered from depression & slight acne.
23	82	4-6 months in, I started getting horrible acne, and I am now on two different prescriptions to (hopefully) get rid of it.
23	83	The acne won't go away and my dermatologist said it won't until I get the implant taken out.
23	84	My acne is completely gone as well (it wasn't severe, but my face is spotless now and nothing changed aside from removal).
23	85	I had cramps, sore breasts, and my acne was awful when I have naturally clear skin.
23	86	I consulted with my doctor she said you're fine you have no periods or acne so keep it in a while longer.
23	87	My acne is terrible, not just on my face, but chest, back, everything.
23	88	No weight or gain or acne either.
23	89	Before I had the birth control I had clear and an even skin tone and was 125 lbs and after a little over a year I had gained 20 lbs and had horrible acne that would not go away no matter what I did.
23	90	I've been on nexplanon for 6 years and had originally to go another three years but I'm getting tired of constantly bleeding, acne, weight gain and mood swings.
23	91	That my acne would come back (my birth control pills greatly controlled my acne) 2.
23	92	I get slight mood swings but no acne or weight gain.
23	93	But since my weight gain and my acne, I will be getting it removed this week.
23	94	I've never had back acne and now it's terrible!!
23	95	I bled pretty consistently for two months and broke out with horrible acne on my chest and back.
23	96	I've also been struggling with terrible acne on my face, neck and back.
23	97	My acne got horrible, I bought face washes, scrubs, toner and I still break out like crazy, I'm always in depression.
23	98	I had brown discharge when I wasn't bleeding and I got acne really bad!
23	99	I started to have acne.
23	100	Other than the nonstop bleeding which is light to moderate I haven't had any of the other side effects, weight gain, acne, depression, mood swings, etc.
23	101	I did have a problem with some acne around the one year mark, but other than that it has never given me any problems.
23	102	Other than that, Nexplanon increased my already mild acne to moderate, hormonal acne.
23	103	It sparked adult acne.
23	104	I have gone from 120lbs to 160lbs, get terrible acne, and deal with even more debilitating depression and anxiety.
23	105	I have acne all over my face, my shoulders, my back, and it's even started on my stomach area.
23	106	While it is great BC for keeping you Unpregnant, I have not one ounce of motivation to get out of bed and do anything, I am always so tired, the acne is insane and I have spots all over my shoulders, chest, face that looks like a rash and is extremely noticeably (especially fresh out of the shower or when hot) & the weight gain is crazy.
23	107	My acne has gone away and I've had no major weight changes.
23	108	I experienced no weight gain and no acne troubles either.
23	109	I have horrible cystic acne on my face, neck, back and shoulders that I've never had and it hurts like hell.
23	110	I get headaches all the time and my anxiety and depression have sky rocketed due to this terrible acne and the 30 pounds I've gained
23	111	I've had severe breakouts of acne which I've never had before, my anxiety has been way worse then ever before, I've gained 20lbs, and has lowered my sex drive a whole lot.
23	112	Then I started getting cystic acne, deep painful acne under the skin that wouldn't go away.
23	113	I tried everything to get rid of the acne but nothing helped, my OBGYN said it was hormonal due to the implant.
23	114	Fast forward to February 2017, my acne is down to 2 bumps at a time but the periods start and stop without notice.
23	115	I've never had acne in my life until I got the implant.
23	116	If the results aren't the same as before I'm calling it quits but the positive is my breasts are fuller and perkier but the acne is horrible!
23	117	Since the initial 4-6 month period, I've had terrible acne which I've never suffered from before, and I've had discharge and regular spotting.
23	118	At least it has been effective, since the weight gain, low sex drive and acne has pretty much made me never want to have sex again, but I cannot wait to get it taken out of my arm.. although I hear that's the worst bit!
23	119	I'm 19 and nexplanon is my very first hormonal birth control, like most ladies have said everyone reacts different with birth control, when I first got nexplanon I was supposed to have my period the following week so the doctor warned me about abnormal periods with birth control but the following I didn't get my period instead I spotted for two full weeks and after that never had a period aside from spotting a few days after sex but doctor said that's completely normal plus pregnancy symptoms almost every month but nexplanon makes you're body think you're pregnant so pregnancy symptoms are completely normal, other than that no weight gain I've noticed a little bit of acne but nothing that skin care won't fix, so far nexplanon is great
23	120	My acne has become a real problem and I haven't even been on it for a whole year.
23	121	The weight gain with acne & not knowing when I'd get my period.
23	122	I've also had horrible acne all over my face, chest and upper arms.
23	123	My acne has never been this bad.
23	124	I'm 19 and I've had the nexplanon for 9 months and although it worked perfectly for preventing pregnancy I have had acne on my chest and shoulders and face sporadically and I haven't had acne since middle school.
23	125	From 2 month long periods, to having the worst acne of my life at 23, I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.
23	126	Since the moment I've gotten nexplanon, I've been broken out so bad with painful, cystic acne that no miracle of skin care or diet seems to touch.
23	127	Before this, I've always taken the pill, and would occasionally get a pimple or two, but I've never had an ongoing problem with acne until now, at 23 years old...
23	128	I had my period for 6 months, started having breast pain and discharge, I was always tired, and oh my gosh acne!!
23	129	Downsides are the depression, mood swings, and my acne (I haven't had since high school) came back.
23	130	I have had the implant for 5 months now and have not had any bleeding, acne or weight gain once.
23	131	My periods went away which is amazing but the depression has gotten worse and I now have cystic acne all along my chin, cheeks forehead, and all over my hairline.
23	132	I've dealt with acne all my life and I finally had it under control so this implant causing my skin to break out in painful cysts is a deal breaker.
23	133	I've just started spotting but not really bleeding about a week and a half before my period  so we will see how that goes, gained but then lost some weight in just 3 weeks no acne influx, but every body is different
23	134	I'm used to a little weight gain, acne, painful periods or none at all.
23	135	It also gave me a low sex drive, weight gain and mild acne.
23	136	I did not gain weight, no acne issues nor mood swings.
23	137	Hormones did not affect my mood or weight but may have worsened my acne.
23	138	For the first month I didn't have any side effects but by the second month my face started breaking out so bad and I haven't had acne since I was about 13.
23	139	I have horrible acne now .
23	140	Me and my partner use protection , so I feel like this birth control with all the weight gain and acne is not worth it .
23	141	I have actually lost weight since I have been on the nexplanon and haven't had any issues with acne.
23	142	I got the birth control in May of 2015 my acne has been more horrible than ever before, and my mood swings have gotten worst than ever, I would be perfectly fine than I turn to being angry and sad.
23	143	2 weeks after the insertion instead of a period I spotted for 2 weeks and had mild cramps but nothing too bad, after the spotting was over it has been a bless, I worry less about pregnancy and so far no period, no weight gain ,no acne.
23	144	I've been eating like a pig and my teenage acne days are upon me again.
23	145	Nobody wants to have sex with a moody miserable sad person covered in cystic acne!
23	146	I been on nexplanon going on 3 years in July I can  honesty say this is the worst  birth control ever please don't make the same mistake I made I suffer mood swings depression long period that last for 2 week maybe more my sex drive was so low,  I had anxiety attacks, bad acne,  yeast infection and weight gain.
23	147	My acne has been worse than before I started this BC, I've had horrible headaches and cramps along with everything else!
23	148	My only negative experience is that it's given me non-stop acne and no skin care routine seems to be working.
23	149	I've had my 'Period' three times a month most times and they all last 5-7 days, I've broken out with acne on my face and chest, my libido is at a ZERO, mood swings like crazy, and I'm always tired.
23	150	Originally went in for a referral to see an endocrinologist for my chin acne, now i'm suffering physically and mentally.
23	151	I had spurts of acne, but having the correct soap for your face makes all the difference.
23	152	My acne was back constantly and my dermatologist pretty much said she was out of options for me.
23	153	I got awful acne and got absolutely nothing from this birth control but wasted money on pads for periods lasting 3-4 weeks.
23	154	In the last year I have started to get acne which I have never suffered with before, I am starting to become depressed which comes and goes but I never had it before I had the implant inserted.
23	155	No acne problems, little weight gain (5-10 pounds)
23	156	I'm not really prone to acne.
23	157	I haven't had any bv since and my acne is clearing!
23	158	Third, the acne.
23	159	Absolutely no side effects that can't be attributed to something else, virtually NO cramps, acceptable amounts of acne (less than most of my life), and often NO periods at all for months at a time!
23	160	It really sucks because it made me feel insecure and my parent's never asked to see the other side effects it was the bloating and acne that i knew of.
23	161	An my acne is horrible an I've gain like 10 pounds
23	162	My acne is much worse, but that's my biggest complaint.
23	163	I have tried the pill and the patch, neither of which did ANYTHING for my heavy bleeding, cramps, or acne and both made me extremely emotional.
23	164	It caused major depression, terrible acne, crazy mood swings, and low sex drive.
23	165	Then I developed horrible cystic acne and didn't put 2 and 2 together right away.
23	166	Even as a teen, I had no acne; now my skin is disgusting.
23	167	I'VE gained a little bit of weight and my acne has been pretty bad, but it was the same as other birth controls.
23	168	My acne has returned.
23	169	My acne was ridiculous, it was worse than when I was in middle school and going through puberty.
23	170	I had acne on my face all the time and eventually it developed all over my chest and back.
23	171	I did not get acne.
23	172	So far I've had the nexplanon implant for 2mnths with no complaints.No side effects of weight gain ,acne or pregnancy.Just minimal spotting during my regular menstruation time.This birth control is amazing.Installing it was a breeze and very comfortable because the NP answered all my questions and was very gentle and reasurring
23	173	My sex drive is normal, no acne issues, and I've managed to lose weight on it too.
23	174	I've actually lost 15 pounds and my acne has cleared up decently.
23	175	The 1st wk was no problem, the next 3 wks I had some acne & sever breast pain, massive breast swelling & also mood swings.
23	176	I got acne when my second pd was supposed to happen, but no bleeding.
23	177	Ok for the first 2 mos and I have no other side effects except terrible acne.
23	178	While I've never had perfectly clear skin, I've also never had acne like this.
23	179	Doctor said hormonal acne unlikely to go away but could see dermatologist if I desire.
23	180	The first year was absolutely amazing: no periods, light acne, no mood swings.
23	181	I have been on my period for 2 weeks now, my mood swings are out of control (I feel like a teenager they way I react), my acne is awful, I've become quite depressed really over nothing, and I don't know if it's just mental but I feel as if I've gained some weight.
23	182	my skin has probably got better as well and I use to have terrible acne.
23	183	Ive gained about 20lb and my acne has flared up.
23	184	I do have acne on my back and this year, my cycle stayed on for 4 months, but it was light.
23	185	I can honestly say its done a great job with keeping me a mom of one child but my side effects includes deep mood swings,some acne here and there but not to much&I just start having these weird migraines that stays in one spot for a few seconds and they happen different parts of my head!
23	186	No side effects no acne no weight gain nothing.
23	187	Not only have I been having attitude issues but my acne is out of control right now.
23	188	I've been on my period for 4 weeks now and my acne continues to get worse.
23	189	Prior to this birth control, I was one of the lucky ones; I used a generic BC and my periods were 3 days, very light, no cramps, acne, or mood swings.
23	190	I had terrible mood swings,  spotting almost daily and acne.
23	191	It began causing issues in my relationship because my boyfriend couldn't understand why I was questioning everything, freaking out over his driving and little unimportant things that I never worry about, I was overly worried about my college assignments to the point of obsessiveness, I formed acne as well.
23	192	Now the only issues I'm having is my acne is extremely bad and it's never been bad at all for me until I got the implant also I get lots of vaginal discharge now.
23	193	Big mistake I did of getting it, when I had gotten it, it freaking hurt  like my arm had hurt for like a while, then time passed I got bad acne and I really don't break out much but man it was bad, on top of that my hair was falling out like crazy my hair was getting thin a lot,on top of that I gained weight now, also the bleeding was annoying it wouldn't go away and before I got my period my pH balance was horrible I couldn't even have sex at all cause of the implant.
23	194	Also had worse acne than when I was a teen.
23	195	I haven't had the majority of the side effects, but I've had 2 that bother me the most: extreme breast tenderness and an increase in my acne.
23	196	I have had it for about 8 months and for me, the only side effects have been slight breast tenderness and a little bit of acne.
23	197	Nexplanon helped me clear up my acne and controlled my weight and I had barely any periods throughout the 3 years I was on it.
23	198	I have also noticed more acne.
23	199	I used to have completely clear skin prior,I would very seldom get a pimple and if I did it would clear quickly,  now its a nonstop battle between acne and menstruation.
23	200	I was worried because of all the bad reviews I saw and the horror stories of weight gain, mood swings, and acne.
23	201	I have had my implant in for a month now, and have had no bad side effects other than my light acne returning.
23	202	I never break out with acne but have just started.
23	203	I didnt get acne but never have suffered with  it.
23	204	No acne, no bleeding, no weight gain, no mood swings, no pregnancy scares..PERFECT!
23	205	I have the worst mood swings, acne, tiredness and lack of sex drive.
23	206	I developed horrible acne but I got it under control and I got crazy of-the-wall mood swings that I didn't realize I developed.
23	207	I also gained 15 pounds and have severe acne which to me is the worst side effect..
23	208	I have never gotten acne before this.
23	209	haven't had a period since , my acne has gone down , no bloating , no cramps , no EXTRA headaches , it's been really good to me so far and I would recommend it to anyone.
23	210	No acne breakouts, mood swings, best of all no PERIODS!!
23	211	No acne or weight gain.
23	212	I suffered from increased acne, I gained over 50 pounds in the past two years, completely lost all interest in being intimate with my fiance, and haven't stopped bleeding/spotting since inserted.. HORRIBLE~
23	213	On the plus side, I haven't noticed any weight gain, and my acne has cleared up.
23	214	I have not gained weight, had mood swings, headaches, or acne which I am prone to normally.
23	215	I haven't noticed any change in my moods or acne.
23	216	But after that no period for 8 months, I have gained 10 pounds and get more acne than usual, horrible mood swings at first, but I'm doing better now.
23	217	I haven't dealt with any increased acne or weight gain, but it's now impossible for me to lose weight, where I had lost about sixty pounds in the year prior to starting this bc.
23	218	I noticed a change in my mood (always up and down), weight (gained), and an HUGE increase of acne.
23	219	However my experience was great with it, I didn't get any heavy bleeding or periods almost immediately after insertion, some spotting not heavy and lasted for about 2 days, I didn't gain weight I lost about 30lbs with it, and my face is tremendously clear it didn't give me acne.
23	220	It also has made my acne worse.
23	221	I now struggle with cystic acne, even on my chest and back, especially around my period.
23	222	I will more than likely call my dermatologist or OBGYN to get a prescription for my acne.
23	223	I would take not having an unwanted pregnancy over acne any day.
23	224	Also had acne, mood swings, irritability, no energy, and extremely tired.
23	225	On top of that I got acne like a 15 year old...
23	226	I'm 22 and I had HORRIBLE acne.
23	227	I have lost 15 pounds and no mood swings, depression or increase in acne.
23	228	However, I have a history of cystic acne and went on accutane several years ago.
23	229	I would not recommend this to anyone who has struggled with acne in the past or is currently struggling with it.
23	230	On top of this I have also started to break out and experience mild acne.
23	231	Also nexplanon has cleared up all of my acne with in the first 6 months of having it.
23	232	I like the fact that I don't have to remember to take a pill daily,  I haven't have my period since october 2014 I still feel cramps but I am not bleeding; I gain a lot weight and I can not make it go down;I am to  tired all the time, kind of depresses,my husband say that I am irritated all the time; sometime I have some acne;and zero libido.
23	233	It worked great for the first 2 years, but after that I started bleeding regularly, gaining weight, and got hormonal cystic acne on my chin.
23	234	Initially, it was great because I never got my period, but now I'm considering switching to a progestin pill to avoid the weight gain, acne and constant bleeding.
23	235	I am still sexually active, no depression, no acne, just what I mentioned above tired 90% of the time, sleepy 80%, spotting every day95%, weight gain >_< sucks.
23	236	It feels while on this implant I have gained weight, gotten facial acne, my sex drive is low and suffering from episodes of depression.
23	237	I been on nexplanon for 2 years I don't Recommend this birth control if u an a  relationship u will be on your period for so long  I suffered with shortness of breath  anxiety  bad acne an long periods
23	238	I still spot here and there but the acne is embarrassing.
23	239	I've had mine for over a year and noticed the weight gain, mood swings, but no acne.
23	240	I've also gained weight and my acne has gotten worse.
23	241	I've also started getting really bad acne ( normally I don't have any)  it's done it's job but I don't recommend it.
23	242	Almost no periods (I only have light spotting occasionally) No weight gain, mood swings, or increase in acne.
23	243	I experienced severe mood swings, acne,  weight gain and unpredictable periods.
23	244	Other than that I don't have weight gain, no mood swings or acne changes, and I'm less moody with nexplanon than any other birth control I've tried.
23	245	I've had migraine headaches, dizziness, acne, and period have came on 1 week and stopped for 2 days and come back on...
23	246	I was also getting random headaches and a lot of acne on my face specially around my chin.
23	247	Horrible mood swings, terrible/huge/painful acne at all times, 0 sex drive.
23	248	I also think the Nexplanon caused more cystic acne on my face.
23	249	I also gained 15 lbs in one month while on a diet, started getting extreme acne and have 0 sex drive.
23	250	I'm gaining weight my acne is at its worst point and I have zero sex drive.
23	251	I've not experienced any weight gain, acne, or anything.
23	252	I did not gain weight, I did not get acne, my hair didn't get more oily, and I didn't cramp.
23	253	The only other side effect I have is acne!
23	254	I've gained probably 10-20 lbs and my acne wasnt bad before I got this and now its been terrible ever since I got it in.
23	255	Aside from all the side effects that I had which included (but not limited to) night sweats, acne, and weight gain/inability to lose weight-worked out often, ate well, baby weight would not come off,I would suggest it as it is effective at preventing pregnancy
23	256	I've been on nexoplanon for 10 months now no side effects I had spotting the first 3-4 months like the doctor told me and I haven't gotten my period since which is awesome cramping here and there and no acne or weight gain.
23	257	Gained 13 pounds, and have acne.
23	258	I got my insert in November of 2013 since then I have gained over 50 pounds but that was the only downside for me, I have no acne whatsoever and have only had a little bit of spotting but that usually happens when you are close to the end when you need to have it removed.
23	259	Weight gain, bloating, severe acne, stretch marks everywhere, mood swings, heavy periods with really bad period symptoms, a lot of spotting, depression.
23	260	I've never had acne in my life, now I break out all the time.
23	261	My acne hasn't change.
23	262	And my acne cleared up.
23	263	Also my acne came back worse than I've ever had it... Just in time for prom:/ my boobs grew 2 sizes but I haven't gained noticeable weight anywhere else.
23	264	I have gained about 10-20 lbs on it in the past 4-5 years, occasionally have acne if super stressed, but it has been a blessing for me overall not having anxiety or heavy periods.
23	265	I didn't have any bruising and the rod is still able to be felt in my arm.I first experienced a little acne and a little weight gain but nothing major.
23	266	The insertion was easy breezy, and my side effects are really limited to a little bit of acne, but it should be noted that I had a pretty good period of acne as an adolescent and took Accutane for it.
23	267	I'd deal with the spotting and some acne if I didn't have to deal with thinning hair.
23	268	Also, I had never had any acne during my adolescence years, but ever since I got on nexplanon, my entire face is covered in pimples.
23	269	Like said before, the acne wasn't as bad in the first few months, but got increasingly worse.
23	270	I had constant mood swings, feelings of depression, brain fog, constant fatigue, super bad acne, and I spotted ALL the time.
23	271	I never had acne like this before now.
23	272	Since this has been inserted August 2015 I now have constant severe acne, I have put on 40 lbs that I can not lose no matter how hard I try, and it has effected me mentally and emotionally.
23	273	My acne takes me back to when I hit puberty and worse... it's on my back which I've never had before, I've gained 15 pounds, no sex drive.
23	274	No hair loss, acne, etc.
23	275	It has also given me moderate to severe acne.
23	276	I take very good care of my skin, but the acne will not go away.
23	277	The reviews of endless spotting, weight gain, and acne have not been true for me at all.
23	278	No acne.
23	279	My face and back have broken out in acne, something I never really had.
23	280	I'll get the occasional pimple once every few months, but that's usually how it goes for me, I don't get acne anyways.
23	281	I also have slight hormonal acne but Primrose Oil supplements are helping with that.
23	282	Has caused-painful breast lumps (still awaiting my ultrasound results from my breast doc), thyroiditis (an inflammed thyroid), thyroid nodules, severe migraines, AWFUL periods (almost all the time, heavy, far more uncomfortable than usual), terrible back pain, fatigue, weight gain, acne.
23	283	No weight gain yet... And i have acne that keeps popping up but I'm not sure if that's due to the implant or not.
23	284	My cramps have gotten continually worse the past few months, as well as my acne.
23	285	The first month I did not have my period eveyrthing was going so well until the second month, I start spotting then bleeding then spotting again, it felt like I had a period since then, I start having acne like I never before.
23	286	It has helped my cystic acne and I only had my period the first month.
23	287	I had acne especially  back acne before but since has really cleared up.
23	288	I have had some unusual acne, but nothing crazy just an extra pimple here or there - it's probably more odd because I can't tie it to a cycle since I have no period.
23	289	Mood swings, severe headaches, hair loss and acne.
23	290	!Next the acne came but this was awful, cystic acne on my jaw and back and face, now I'm experiencing extreme depression and anxiety.
23	291	I'm on it now and I haven't gained any weight or had any acne problems honestly it just depends on the person it reacts different for everyone and I only get a period for 2 weeks every 3to 4 months so not bad at all
23	292	I gained over 50 pounds, acne on my face, bloating all the time, and mood swings.
23	293	This birth control gave me horrible acne on my jaw, my back, and my chest.
23	294	I have never struggled with back acne, but after being on this birth control I now have scars on my back from the acne being so bad.
23	295	My jaw acne is horrible.
23	296	Side effects included: prolonged/heavy periods (lasting 3-4 weeks), anemia (due to periods), recurrent yeast infections (due to periods), painful vaginal fissures (due to yeast infections), lack of sex drive, constant bloating, rapid weight gain, increased appetite, acne, irritability, extreme mood swings, anxiety and depression (honestly, who wouldn't be depressed).
23	297	That was nice, but the hormonal acne is NOT WORTH it at all.
23	298	I started breaking out little by little until I started getting cystic acne that would last for weeks.
23	299	The major downside: I got terrible acne, on my face, chest, and back with Nexplanon.
23	300	Where do I start, I got the nexplanon 68mg implant put in on 13 January 2014 6 months after having my daughter, at first it was ok although I did bleed for the first few months, then my period stopped, I started to have mood swings and when I say mood swings I was evil, would probably say physchotic, I attacked my partner something I am not proud of I hate violence, then the acne, the daily headaches and I mean daily I have yet to remember when I didn't wake up with a migraine, my teenage son says I am so moody and all I do is shout, also the weight gain, as I said at first it was fine then the weight started piling on I have gained over 3 stone on this and I have not changed my lifestyle or eating habits all it is horrible avoid!
23	301	Also,  I've gotten back acne a bit.
23	302	(Ex: oily face / back  which lead to acne one month, random cramps no blood the next month, constant  headaches and moodiness the next,  and so on).
23	303	However, if you already have high levels of progesterone this might make you irritable, give you acne, cause weight gain, etc.
23	304	I haven't had a migraine since starting this, my adult acne has cleared up, my depression has lessened, and I haven't had any spotting or periods!
23	305	Well I hate the Nexplanon... ever since I got it put in my arm I have been gaining weight and haven't been able to lose it no matter what I do, my acne has never been worse, my anxiety has never been higher and the mood swings are terrible.
23	306	My face started to have bad acne all over again.
23	307	I also have NEVER had acne, like maybe five pimples a year since entering high school.
23	308	One major downside: I get acne frequently now.
23	309	I've had it for less than a week and my acne is AWFUL!
23	310	A week after insertion I developed terrible acne, then about two months in experienced depression.
23	311	I had it removed and my symptoms ceased and have not had a reoccurrence of depression or the acne since having it removed.
23	312	My hair is so greasy and I have had SEVERE acne for a month now.
23	313	I haven't had acne since high school, but now I break out all over my face/chest/back.
23	314	First couple months spotted every couple of days and spotty acne started.
23	315	Period was normal for Sept, but then was non-stop for all four weeks of Oct. Serious acne formed into rough patches all over my face.
23	316	steadily loosing weight and not gaining, no acne, no mood swings or depression.
23	317	This is why I decided to post to make sure if you are planning of getting the implant be aware that after the year was when Nexplanon and I broke up I started constantly bleeding, horrible hormonal acne  that took days to cure and at that time more would keep coming out, lower sex drive (, and most of all the MOOD SWINGS, I was so angry and unhappy (sadly not for me)
23	318	My acne didn't get any worse but I did randomly get depressed, especially for about the first 3 months mood swings like crazy.
23	319	Next I started to lose more hair than normal and getting acne worse than I usually do.
23	320	Plus, acne !
23	321	I've been on accutane when I was younger and now I have acne all over again because of this implant.
23	322	However now I'm constantly spotting constantly it never stops, my acne is going insane, my depression medication doesn't work, and I've gained over 20 pounds.
23	323	I have awful headaches, acne, weight gain, mood swings that are INSANE, I'm rarely happy, always in a bad mood- so angry, NO sex drive- like don't touch or kiss me.
23	324	Now reading the other reviews and the side effects, I now know why I've been gaining a little weight, got some acne, and have been yelling at people for now reason.
23	325	Sex drive down, depression & stress at an all time high, acne has magically appeared, pores are enlarged, I have black blotches on my face, it's hard to focus, my period used to last 3 days now it last 3-6 weeks, if I'm not on my period then I'm spotting, pain with intercourse, I've never had cramps before but I get extreme ones now whether I'm on or off my cycle, hair is falling out, and I am LOSING weight (I'm already teeny weeny) I tried to wait a year, but I want this removed immediately.
23	326	I've gained no weight, had no acne break outs, and have not gotten pregnant.
23	327	We will start first with acne I have had acne since forever but since going on this it has become way worse i wanna cry!
23	328	My acne had gotten worse but I've always had that issue.
23	329	I was put on medication for this but more recently, I have started having issues such as constant bleeding with no breaks, acne, I have been placed on a stronger dose of medication for depression and anxiety for the second time as this has just gotten worse, migranes and muscle aches and pains!
23	330	Severe acne!
23	331	my acne has stayed the same (I'm 19 with regular hormonal acne).
23	332	I got terrible acne on my back, which I hadn't had since my late teens (I'm 27), and I was constantly bloated.
23	333	I had some acne before the implant but now it's become worse.
23	334	I guess you have to give and take so depends on if you can handle some weight and acne for no periods.
23	335	Really talk to your doc about your acne history and take notes from your body early if it's just not going well.
23	336	Had it removed and started the pill again, acne has subsided and I'm much more cheerful
23	337	A week after, my acne is cleared up, I have more energy, I am less moody, I am less bloated.
23	338	Looking through some other reviews I think my problems over the past year with acne, weight gain, and mood swings may be partially attributable to Nexplanon.
23	339	I LOVED the nexplanon, but sadly i had to get it removed :( i got it over 10 months ago (they say it takes about 9 to be in full effect) i had no weight gain, no emotional instability, no acne, no blotting, still had a sex drive.
23	340	I've had more acne than I've ever had.
23	341	During those two weeks, I developed some acne on my chest and back and my sex drive was through the roof.
23	342	I got my nexplanon implanted in November 2015 and it was fine no bleeding a little increased acne and I actually lost weight.
23	343	And no matter what I do it won't come off I've been exercising for 2 months now and eating clean and not even a 1 lb off, I get moody, I have face and neck acne which I have never had not even as a teen, I'm always sluggish with no motivation for anything, I don't feel my self 50% of the time, I get nausea at night, and dizzy like crazy.
23	344	I've had horrible depression, constant hunger, extreme fatigue and acne.
23	345	My acne has gotten worse in the past year ranging from face acne to moderately severe back, chest, and shoulder acne.
23	346	I have a ridiculously large appetite, and my acne has become painful and very obvious.
23	347	Severe acne started and headaches that caused her to miss school.
23	348	My daughter never has had acne before.
23	349	I've gained 45 lbs since I've started, I've gotten worse acne than when I was a teenager, and the depression and anxiety has practically crippled me (and has definitely not helped the first two issues).
23	350	Unfortunately it made my acne worse than it had been in years and I was put on new medication ( there goes me not taking any pills).
23	351	Once on the acne meds, I had my period every week for five weeks!
23	352	I have gained about 10lbs, minor acne outbreaks around my upper back.
23	353	Since she had Nex inserted she has gained about 25 pounds, suffered from depression and anxiety, became anemic, broke out with body acne (she's never had acne, other than an occasional pimple in her teens), been to the ER and Doctor several times for ovarian cysts (never had them before) and bleeds three to four weeks straight every three months.
23	354	Bad acne.
23	355	I have really bad hormonal acne and it's everywhere all over my face.
23	356	I have finally found a face wash that is helping with it, but I will continue to struggle with acne (I never have before until now) for the longest time.
23	357	So I guess I just have to deal with the acne.
23	358	I've had mood swings like crazy, I'm getting acne but for overall effectiveness it's wonderful.
23	359	My acne though has gone down a ton, amazing on that part.
23	360	A got awful acne.
23	361	I also get bad acne once a month, which I never had before!
23	362	Major weight gain, unpredictable bleeding, acne, worsening depression and zero sex drive.
23	363	I had mood swings, dry hair/skin, moderate acne.
23	364	I also developed horrible acne after never having acne in my life.
23	365	I also started getting frequent acne breakouts which was the only annoying thing about this.
23	366	Non stop heavy bleeding,  I was hormonal,  angry,  in pain,  acne,  ten pound weight gain...it was terrible.
23	367	I had problems with acne in the beginning, but for my first time ever using a hormonal birth control, and having really acne prone skin that was expected.
23	368	It may have helped clear acne...
23	369	Mood is levelled out, the light acne I'd get on my face has been absent.
23	370	The first thing I noticed was the acne.
23	371	I've never had perfect skin, but my acne has never been out of control before.
23	372	And I've never had acne on my chest or shoulders before, either.
23	373	Bad acne, dry mouth and pelvic pains also becomes apparent.
23	374	My anxiety heightened, my depression worsened, I got terrible acne, I got awful migraines and I bled nonstop for two months.
23	375	No mood swings, no drastic weight gain, acne etc.
23	376	Irritability, mood swings, depression, anxiety, uncontrollable anger, weight gain, acne, oily hair, and hair loss.
23	377	If you've ever had issues with depression, anxiety, or acne, DO NOT get Nexplanon!
23	378	During my time on it I didn't experience any unusual weight gain or loss, my acne remained the same, I wasn't emotionally crazy.
23	379	No mood swings, no acne, no low sex drive and no periods!
23	380	My acne has also become wayyyyyyyyyyyy worse.
23	381	If I can get my acne to go away by using a dermatologist I'd say it's worth it.
23	382	No weight gain, no acne.
23	383	I experienced a little acne in the beginning but this is normal when you change the hormones in your body.
23	384	After time, the acne cleared up.
23	385	I had acne prior to going on the pill which cleared it up however when I went off it it came back.
23	386	No change in acne and my weight seems to stay the same.
23	387	I've had sore breasts, bad acne, extremely weight gain, severe headaches, no sex drive, blurred vision, and constantly hungry.
23	388	I am having my Nexplanon removed Jan. Also, I have severe acne due to this drug.
23	389	So to wrap up all symptoms I have since I got this drug, nausea weight gain acne depression anxiety followed by severe panic attacks.
23	390	I have noticed more acne than usual for me, but nothing extreme.
23	391	I've had terrible acne before but this made it out of control.
23	392	Only downside is acne.
23	393	I got HORRIBLE acne, slight weight gain, and CONSTANT bleeding.
23	394	I also have experienced slight mood swings and acne, but the weight gain is by far the worst and most noticeable.
23	395	The cons for me: headaches, cystic acne, and weight gain.
23	396	Not to mention constant acne, mood swings, and I gained almost 20lbs!
23	397	Also, acne; ive had my whole life so i cant say its causes my random break outs.
23	398	I now get acne that I didn't get before and my breast are always tender (they've grown but they HURT) I feel the rod release the hormone too, which is painful but other than all that it is effective and unlike depo, I'm not as weak and tired anymore & my headaches aren't as strong and my bones don't ache nor does my joints anymore.
23	399	I'm 28 years old now and my weight is the same no acne but my mood swings are so crazy.
23	400	No weight gain, no acne, not pregnant which is so nice not to worry about.
23	401	If that's not enough, I randomly have the worst acne and I don't mean a pimple here and there full on acne all the time scars, etc, etc.
23	402	It effects everyone different I've never gotten a lot of acne and still dont.
23	403	Headaches,acne,nausea and weight gain ,sometimes lost of appetite.
23	404	I tired constantly even with 8 hours of sleep I never had acne before and now I get cystic acne which is painful.
23	405	I have never had bad acne, but it seems that the implant has helped with that, and I'm not pregnant, but who could be after bleeding for nearly 11 months straight.
23	406	I've had no mood swings, no weight gain, no acne.
23	407	No weight gain, acne or irregular bleeding.
23	408	But my super bitchy mood swings, low sex drive, acne, back aches and weight gain made this birth control NOT worth it.
23	409	Weight gain (more than when I was pregnant), irritability (I don't want to be bothered by anyone or anything), acne, decreased sex drive.. it's the only birth control that I haven't gotten pregnant on, but it's not worth it because of the person I've become.
23	410	Now Oct 2015 I have had 2 cycles this month, Throwing up, Headaches, BAD acne, Sore breast!
23	411	Also before this medication, I have never had troubling acne ever.
23	412	The acne is horrible, along with feeling as if I am going to pass out many times a day, headaches, and nausea.
23	413	Let me not forget the acne.
23	414	It also has given me the worst acne EVER my face will clear up and then a day or two later come back!
23	415	I did have acne and weight gain not sure if it's connected with the implant.
23	416	I'm 20 years old I've had pimples every now and then but never acne.
23	417	My periods since the insertion have been fine, no increased acne, and my boobs got bigger.
23	418	I hate this thing I been bleeding for months now I have never had acne and now its terrible!
23	419	25 pound weight gain, continuous acne and uncontrollable cravings..It was horrible.
23	420	I never had acne and now my face is covered in acne scars.
23	421	I have acne all over my chest and back.
23	422	The only side affects that I have noticed are acne and mood swings.
23	423	I'm due to have it removed in December of 2015, however I'm probably going to get it removed sooner, due to the acne.
23	424	The first 2 weeks I loved it I lost 10 pounds and my acne started to clear up.
23	425	I've also been experiencing some pretty bad acne, which I never had a problem with previously.
23	426	These last 4 months however, I have developed AWFUL acne on my neck and chin and face.
23	427	It hasn't helped with my acne or hormones.
23	428	Mood swings around the time I'm supposed to be on my period and minimal acne around that time as well.
23	429	... and I developed severe acne- I've never had acne before the implant.
23	430	I got mine in April 2014, since then I have had constant periods, head aches, acne, and my arm where the implant us very very sensitive.
23	431	Still a good decision... no periods since June 2012 spotted only twice no cramps no real mood swings.. but a little more acne and a lower sex drive are the faults.. but hey I'll take that deal if it means no stress about getting pregnant
23	432	I also have not gained any weight, and have had no issues with acne.
23	433	As for side effects, I've just had a little bit of acne but nothing major and I'm not even sure it's a side effect from the implant.
23	434	I experienced no weight change but went from having perfectly clear skin to extremely bad acne.
23	435	I've considered getting it taken out because of the acne issues but am enjoying not having a period.
23	436	My acne is so bad!
23	437	The only other strange symptom has been two cystic acne like pimples at my hair line that wouldn't go away but I just checked and those have disappeared so I am VERY HAPPY with my decision to get the nexplanon!
23	438	I was extremely nervous to get nexplanon because all I could find were scary reviews telling horror stories of hair loss, acne, and never ending bleeding, but my doctor assured me all of her patients had loved it.
23	439	I would rarely get periods, no weight gain, acne or any side effects really.
23	440	Since getting the implant three months ago I've had constant bleeding, weight gain, acne, major mood swings, unbearable cramps everyday, no energy and I've constantly been feeling down.
23	441	it helped my acne but that's all.
23	442	I have not gained weight, but I did start getting acne.
23	443	I feel bloated, stomach feels weird, back cramps, cystic acne.
23	444	Also, my acne has gotten worst!
23	445	I have gotten acne scars and stretch marks, bad stretch marks from gaining the weight and the acne.
23	446	Additionally, my acne got worse and did not improve.
23	447	Chin acne out of control.
23	448	I am going on Ortho Tri Cylclen for my acne now..if you suffer from acne, go on OTC... it suppresses testosterone
23	449	I have had terrible acne come up on my back, as well as weight gain.
23	450	My symptoms didn't show up until recently: violent mood swings, headaches, nausea, dizziness, backache, acne on face & body.
23	451	I don't feel like myself anymore and my acne is cystic and doesn't go away with any kind of face wash -even with prescribed face wash.
23	452	I have increased acne but it is minimal.
23	453	I haven't noticed any weight gain yet, but have noticed minor acne.
23	454	Ive gained no weight,  and only a little acne, but I am a teenager.
23	455	I have had issues with other forms of birth control in the past (weight gain, insomnia, acne, etc.
23	456	On the pill I was depressed, moody, had terrible acne breakouts and was an emotional wreck.
23	457	Good thing I'm not pregnant but haven't gained a pound, and my periods have became normal but stays on a little longer before, I have gotten acne and a little mood swings that's about it ...I will recommend it  but like I said as far as becoming pregnant it works but all the other side effects you may get them and you may not
23	458	I've also had really bad acne.
23	459	It's even helped cleared up some acne!
23	460	I wanted it removed after the first 3 due to acne and major hair loss but my doctor kept convincing me to 'wait it out'.
23	461	Throughout the months I've had terrible mood swings, depression, devastating hair loss, acne and now prolonged spotting/bleeding all of which are why I am getting my implant out this week.
23	462	Easiest way to not have babies... light bleeding for a month, headaches, mood swings, acne and weight gain... after 4 months all clear up except for the waight gain it was only 13 pounds but for my height it was alot no periods for almost 1 year and half after that i had normal to light periods every other month.
23	463	Only clean fresh food, and still my face was/is an acne mess!
23	464	Besides the acne I felt depression, mood swings, massive hair loss and no desire for sex at all.
23	465	After using multiple remedies and medications to help with the acne, I noticed that it wasn't improving, just moving from one side to the other.
23	466	Some would say I didn't give it chance to improve, however, the acne was already leaving scars and progressively getting worse.
23	467	My best advice is if acne is something that would bother you, don't bother with this method.
23	468	No PMS other than some acne flare-ups every few weeks.
23	469	Major acne?
23	470	(it is now June 2015) I've never really had an issue with acne, I'm now breaking out constantly.
23	471	I've had this implant for 7 months now, I've had no problems except for real bad acne breakouts.
23	472	I've alway suffered from acne here and there but it's gotten bad after the implant.
23	473	At first I thought it was something I ate but I did some research and found out that this implant contains progesterone which can cause acne.
23	474	No acne, I've lost weight, I've always gotten  headaches.
23	475	Some small pimples on my face but not severe acne.
23	476	The only side effects I've noticed are acne, slight decrease in sex drive, and weight gain.
23	477	I haven't gained any weight, no acne, no cravings, no mood swings, nothing at all.
23	478	It didn't clear up my acne the way bc pills did.
23	479	Other effects (acne,mood swings, depression, laziness )
23	480	Every since I got on this birth control my face was been clean of acne.
23	481	I I had it in since November 2015 other than acne increase I have no complaints.
23	482	Massive acne out breaks but the worst was the mood swings.
23	483	Got some acne .
23	484	What I really don't like about it is the awful body acne its given me, and for this reason I am considering having it taken out, but I do really like how convenient and effective it is.
23	485	My body aches, muscles hurt everywhere, acne is a little more than before, cravings are crazy, but I have no weight gain or weight loss thank the lord!
23	486	The only thing I will say maybe true is that it gives you acne.
23	487	I'm currently on medication given by my dermatologist  for acne and have been taking it weeks before I even got Nexplanon, but about a week after having it, I beganed to notice more acne breakouts!
23	488	Still to this day, One side of my face has an unusual area of acne, that I treat with tretinoin cream on every other night!
23	489	After reading these reviews, I became afraid to get it since weight gain, acne, mood swings, etc.
23	490	I have a mild increase in acne, not super moody, don't see much change.
23	491	I had no serious effects except acne really bad the first few weeks.
23	492	So far I have no period, acne, weight gain, mood, or sex drive issues.
23	493	No major issues with acne.
23	494	Severe acne and mood swings.
23	495	I immediately had terrible acne breakouts (face, chest, back), emotional changes, intense hunger, and reduced sex drive.
23	496	After a year, my acne isn't quite as bad, but I've gained 15 pounds and my sex drive is still low.
23	497	I don't want people staring at my acne and excess weight!
23	498	I had pretty moderate acne (I've suffered from acne since I was 10) when I started Nexplanon.
23	499	I was initially worried that it would make my acne even worse since that is what most people had been saying.
23	500	My moods are better, my acne comes and goes.
23	501	My moods were all over the place, I had acne, I gained 7 pounds, and my sex drive was destroyed.
23	502	The nexplanon was only good for three things, helping my acne, protecting against pregnancy, and not having to take a pill every night.
23	503	I was extremely sensitive, and now I'm having terrible terrible acne.
23	504	Also, I didn't get any acne but for the first month, I would get nauseous easily after doing cardio or even after having 1 alcoholic beverage.
23	505	i've also gotten more acne since starting it.
23	506	I've had Nexplanon since 11/5/14 and the whole first week I had extreme nausea, then bled for 3 weeks, was okay for about a month and now I'm back to nonstop bleeding, extreme nausea, very anxious, crying all the time, acne, and I'm just overall very unhappy and no longer myself.
23	507	At first it did really screw with my periods and acne and emotions and I almost had it removed but my doctor said I should keep it for at least a year so my body would have enough time to adjust.
23	508	The only thing that hasn't gone away is my acne, it's actually gotten a little bit worse.
23	509	Overall, I'm not pregnant, and it hasn't effected my mood, craving, acne, anything.
23	510	Little to no acne.
23	511	I bled constantly the first 9 months along with acne and horrible cramps.
23	512	I've had major weight gain, about 30 pounds, no acne.
23	513	Stress and anxiety increased and so did acne.
23	514	Have occasional acne but nothing severe or long lasting.
23	515	No change in my libido nor my hair is falling, nor have acne.
23	516	And have a problem with acne which I've never have more then one pimple at a time.
23	517	I have no bleeding but I do get acne and cramping.
23	518	I've also started getting more acne, my face is more oily, my hair becomes greasy quicker, and my scalp, cheeks, forehead, and nose are always dry.
23	519	I have no side effects, except that my acne got a little worse but that could just be because I'm 20 and still young.
23	520	I guess everyone responds differently but I haven't experienced any acne breakouts, moodiness, prolonged periods...
23	521	No period, no mood changes, no bleeding, no nothing but a little bit more acne but could be from stress right now because I've been dealing with a lot.
23	522	I get headaches everyday, I'm on medium to light periods the WHOLE month (always bloated), and I'm losing a lot of hair not the average amount of hair loss after a pregnancy...also regular acne breakouts which I didn't have.
23	523	The only downfall is now would be the time of my second period and I have horrible acne!
23	524	Other than the acne no other side effects, I can deal with the acne if it's only once a month.
23	525	I lost a lb, no acne, no headaches and I haven't bled or spotted.
23	526	I have always had great skin and on this medication it exploded with both random dryness and severe acne.
23	527	No increase in acne.
23	528	I have acne here and there but I don't know if that's from the Nexplanon or not.
23	529	The only side effect I have really noticed is I get more acne, but I'd rather have acne than a baby!
23	530	I do have a little more acne than before but nothing that doesn't disappear within a few days.
23	531	My only problem has been acne.
23	532	I have had acne since I was 13 and have struggled to keep it under control.
23	533	I'm considering having it removed, but really don't want to just for acne because it works great.
23	534	After I first had it implanted I had a lot of cystic acne on my jaw and cheeks but that cleared up after about 2 months and hasn't returned.
23	535	I haven't had issues with acne.
23	536	I had no unpleasant side effects on this medication, bar the cystic acne it caused!
23	537	I did experience bruising at the insertion site I have all the acne and abundance of cravings.
23	538	I do get a bit of acne, and I do get migraines at times but besides that everything was fine.
23	539	No acne, no weight gain.
23	540	I started losing my hair, got terrible acne and gained about 10 pounds.
23	541	The only side effect I'm getting is acne.
23	542	so much acne!
23	543	I have never had acne ever and now I'm breaking out like crazy.
23	544	With the weight gain, constant spotting/period, and acne, its safe to say I'm super moody, self conscious, and going nuts because of it.
23	545	I have gained 20 pounds since then and I also have acne now.
23	546	My face is horribly broke out my chest and back have little bit of acne, I get moody, tired, achy and cramps bad.
23	547	The first 2 months were AWFUL with acne, depression, crying, and mood swings, which stabilized once I recognized the cause.
23	548	May 2014 I got it put back into see if I reacted the same  2 weeks in a had I super light two week period and haven't had anything since weight loss but no gain, a tiny bit of acne.
23	549	My sex drive is blah but never really had one, I would say I'd consider going back to the patches because of this crazy acne.
23	550	I've never had acne and as soon as I switched I don't know what to do with all this acne and I don't wear makeup, nothing changed in my life but the birth control.
23	551	I have a little more acne than usual but I can deal with it.
23	552	No acne and no weight gain.
23	553	I went from the pill, right to Nexplanon, I've had it for over a month, I have felt literally no difference, no weight gain or crazy cravings, I feel like it's actually helped my acne, it was painless, only thing was it made my piercings hurt because of the hormones but that went away in about a week.
23	554	Can't say anything about acne because I've always had it and weight gain?
23	555	The first six weeks were great with no side effects, but since then I've had constant bleeding, developed bad acne on my back and chest (no history of acne problems), am tired and forgetful, and my sex drive has decreased.
23	556	Since then, I have had horrendous breakouts on my cheeks, chest and my back; I haven't had problems with acne ever.
23	557	I have not gained weight in fact I am losing weight, and no problems with acne.
23	558	I developed acne, which I never had before!
23	559	I have acne breakouts on my lower chin every now and then.
23	560	Unfortunately I have never had acne until I had it inserted and its horrible.
23	561	I started getting acne and my sex drive was down to the ground!
23	562	I realized I started breaking out and my face got more oily for maybe 4 days at the most after getting it and I haven't had acne since.
23	563	The first few weeks made me gain weight and I started getting big under the surface acne that hurt.
23	564	No moodiness, a little bit of weight gain but I think that's because I stopped breastfeeding, no headaches, and no acne.
23	565	My acne has flared up during this period but I've never had great skin and it's not worse than normal.
23	566	Also, I have not gained any weight and my acne is no worse than it was before.
23	567	Symptoms I have noticed is acne I've never had such oily hair and skin before, and also some weight gain.
23	568	I get the occasional acne here and there but again nothing too bad.
23	569	The acne is horrible I get it in my face, back and chest.
23	570	I have always had very little acne and Nexplanon did not cause my acne to increase.
23	571	I'm 25 years old and I've never had acne.
23	572	I have experienced a lot more acne problems than before, I had completely clear skin, and now I get painful, large pimples.
23	573	Before that I was on the Depo-Provera shot, which made me break out all over my chest and back, and the jawline - hormonal areas for acne.
23	574	I haven't had any other side effects (headaches, acne, etc.)
23	575	During that year I struggled a lot with acne, it just seemed to keep getting worse.
23	576	Since I've started using Nexplanon my acne had cleared and I have had hardly any breakouts.
23	577	I did have a little bruising around the insertion spot at first and my acne has gotten a little worse, but nothing extreme.
23	578	I also experienced a minor acne breakout.
23	579	I haven't had any problem with acne, weight gain (I've lost weight, actually) or hair loss, but the bleeding, oh dear God, the bleeding...
23	580	But, I've gained about 15 pounds (no appetite change, that's the weird part) and had to start using acne face washes (not bad, I just wash my face with it in the shower and then use an oil free moisturizer).
23	581	I have been on it for 8 months now and its working for the birth control part, but I have had my period every other week for at least 6 days and have gotten quite a bit of acne on my face.
23	582	I experience no side effects; no weight gain, no acne, no mood swings, etc.
23	583	I have also experienced most of the negative side effects such as acne, heavy bleeding, weight gain, moodiness, hair loss, and increase in appetite to the point of nausea.
23	584	The occasional mood swing and a little acne on my arms but besides that its great.
23	585	The worst part is I get very bad acne i have never had this issue and now one side of my face looks very ugly!!!!!!
23	586	They may want to chnge the hormone effects with this considering acne problems.
23	587	It has also started acne on my back as well!!!
23	588	I didn't bleed but my side effects were terrible acne and minimal mood swings (both can be managed.)
23	589	The only cons are that it hurt when I got it in, and the amount of acne I got, but I think it's worth the effectiveness.
23	590	I don't have acne, but I can't help but think a weight gain of 40 lbs in a year is related to it.
23	591	I had acne, hair loss, & weight gain.
23	592	He was right, after 8 months, the acne calmed down, I stopped losing hair and I haven't had a period since!
23	593	I've had no mood swings, no acne, I've gained about 7 pounds but it's in the areas I want it so I'm not complaining.
23	594	The only bad thing to report is a slight acne increase.
23	595	No emotional changes, no weight gain, no acne, ect.
23	596	But right around the 5 month mark I slowly started developing really awful acne.
23	597	acne?
23	598	I got the nexplanon on 9/30/13 after having the mirena for 5yrs that worked great it was time to get a new form of birth control.. so i said yeah 3yrs nexplanon sounded great.. so i got it.. well i have not had any period, no acne, and now this past sunday 10/20/13 it came out of my arm as i was cleaning.. i called the doctor mant times the previous weeks & told them it was not healing, and freaking out that it would come out of my arm.. WEll for sure it is out.. NOW i sit here with the concern that over less than a few weeks was it even working if it could just come out like that.
23	599	I suffer with PMD so its helped a great deal &  I feel like I just get normal pmt now not that out of control feeling I used to get, no acne, bloating or greasy hair, result!
23	600	I have not had any oily skin or acne breakouts, mood swings, hair loss, or weight gain.
23	601	My entire life I've had perfect skin and now I have acne all over my forehead.
23	602	For Nexplanon, it really depends on what's more important to you: not getting pregnant or not getting acne.
23	603	It also gave me mood swings but by far the worst part was the acne.
23	604	I was freaking out reading the comments thinking I'm going to bleed for months on end and have acne all over my face, but my experience has been the exact opposite.
23	605	I haven't had any other side effects, no acne, no weight gain, the only thing that I want to point out is it really hurts.
23	606	What wasn't as noticeable was my acne spreading all across my back and down my buttocks.
23	607	Because of the acne and the weight gain, I'm having it removed in a few weeks.
23	608	I also didn't have any acne problems.
23	609	I think Nexplanon had to do with it because my problem acne areas haven't had any breakouts and I love it.
23	610	I have had a slight increase in acne, and I asked my doctor about that before I had the implant inserted.
23	611	No further problems except a slight breakout of acne but I have bad skin anyway.
23	612	The only problem that I have now is acne.
23	613	During that time I also got bad acne on my face which I never had a problem with before.
23	614	No mood swings, no cramps, no period, acne cleared up.
23	615	I have had no period, no problems with acne, or bloating, or cramping.
23	616	I did have a little body acne too but I think that was because I totally stopped birth control for a few months, before this my body wasn't used to it.
23	617	I did have some acne problems in the beginning but that cleared up quickly.
23	618	I'm not Moody, no crampy, no weight gain, no acne, basically nothing other than spotting now (very dark, and I keep a liner on everyday).
23	619	My acne is terrible, I have bad hair loss, I've been so sleepy lately I'm assuming my iron is low from all the blood loss.
23	620	I'm breaking out worse than I did as a teenager because the Nexplanon is suppressing my body's ability to produce estrogen.
23	621	I stopped eating sugars and dairy products for two months, my skin stayed breaking out.
23	622	I've also been breaking out more than usual but nothing too bad.
23	623	It has also caused me to have the worst cramps I have ever had, also I'm breaking out worse than I ever have before I had this thing.
23	624	I also started breaking out badly and gaining weight fast.
23	625	Then I started breaking out and it continued to get worse.
23	626	Also, my face is breaking out like it did when I was in middle school.
23	627	I've been breaking out lately on my face.
23	628	Also I've been breaking out on my face and spotting, I haven't bled a lot which is good and its the only reason I still have it in.
23	629	I started breaking out EVERYWHERE!
23	630	Around the second month of being on nexplanon, I was breaking out on my shoulders and neck (which are areas that I haven't broken out in for years).
23	631	Then I had my period for about a month so they gave me estrogen to stop it and I just ended up breaking out in hives for a month.
23	632	Been breaking out on my face a lot more.
23	633	As well as I'm gaining weight and my face is breaking out.
23	634	I started breaking out a lot along my cheeks and chin which does mean it's hormonal and also on my back which is something I've never experienced before.
23	635	I'm on Nexplanon for about a week or so and already breaking out bad also have lower stomach pain which is one of the signs to call a doctor to remove it going tomorrow also coughed out a little blood never again the side effects scare me read them all on the nexplanon website along with others don't recommend rather be on something that has less severe side effects
23	636	I had no libido at first I am breaking out like I just started puberty and my anger is 10x what it should be.
23	637	My skin is also constantly breaking out with hormonal spots, which is even worse when I'm taking norethisterone.
23	638	My face has been breaking out really bad.
23	639	I have been breaking out, my face is constantly oily, and I have gained weight...
23	640	It's hideous I'm constantly breaking out, never had back ache ever, my skin has become rough.
23	641	I broke out twice as much as I did before, and I'm still breaking out everyday.
23	642	I've also been breaking out a lot more often than I used to.
23	643	Now I am breaking out with ache more than I ever have.
23	644	But then almost immediately I started breaking out big time in my face.
23	645	A couple weeks after I had it, I  started breaking out pretty bad.
23	646	The side effects however suck, I was and still am always nauseous, very light random spotting, still feel myself ovulating resulting in cramps, some minor breaking out (I'm 24 so it's not puberty lol) nothing too horrible though, and major mood swings ( thanks hubs for understanding).
23	647	I waited to see if it would subside but then I started breaking out and I just kept gaining weight even with dietary changes over the last few months.
23	648	I'm very satisfied except for the fact that my face has been breaking out so much and gained so much weight.
23	649	About 7 months went by and I started breaking out really bad around my mouth, chin, and jawline.
23	650	My skin is oily now and I'm breaking out on my forehead.
23	651	I also have been breaking out on my chin and having some consitpation/stomach problems.
23	652	So far so good with the Nexplanon, the only thing I don't like is that I'm breaking out really bad.
23	653	It scars and I'm constantly breaking out.
23	654	I was worried about gaining weight or breaking out but I've experienced neither.
23	655	Painful pimples appeared every time I had bleedings.
23	656	While I've maybe had 10 zits my entire 30 years before Nexplanon, I probably had at least 2 pimples at all times since I got the implant.
23	657	Deep, painful pimples with obvious whiteheads.
23	658	I had never had any pimples on my chest or back and very few on my face and now I get them all the time.
23	659	This is not just a couple of pimples, im talking about black/white heads covering the entire surface of my face.
23	660	I still get a couple pimples here and there.
23	661	I haven't gained any weight yet, in fact, I have been losing weight just like I was before I got the implant (I was working on losing weight for my upcoming summer vacation), I have noticed some more pimples in my chin area, but they aren't severe and it's very few.
23	662	I will say I have increased pimples (but not on my face, hooray!)
23	663	It has also caused my skin to be really oily and causes me to get pimples often.
23	664	My face has never broken out like this before (it's aweful) pimples in places I've never had.
23	665	I got several very deep cystic pimples on my back (Never, ever had pimples on my back).
23	666	All my side effects have disappeared now since I took it out 3 days ago, but I am still waiting for my pimples to go away.
23	667	I get more pimples and am ALWAYS tired.
23	668	Before getting Nexplanon, I never broke out and rarely had greasy skin/hair, but after getting it inserted, I get occasional pimples and my skin and hair get extremely greasy throughout the day.
23	669	No weight gain and more pimples than usual on my chest and back.
23	670	I hardly notice it, my period symptoms have also lightened up a bit (less pimples, less cramps, less attitude).
23	671	My skin got a little more oily so I have a few more pimples here and there but I think it's worth it for the freeness of having a birth control that you don't have to remember to take regularly.
23	672	After that I haven't had any issues other than a couple days of light spotting and a few zits here and there, but lets be honest, you are always going to have some type of reaction to birth control so I'll take this!!!
23	673	Overall, it's been good, I'll take a few zits over an unwanted pregnancy!
23	674	My Acne has increased a bit about 2x as bad as it was (which was like 3-5 zits and very few blackheads per period).
23	675	I experience a lot of bad headaches, 1-2 cramps a week that aren't bad,  recently I've been getting mood swings and I become very irritable easily.
23	676	I have noticed my breasts stay sorer for longer and I have light menstrual cramps off and on when I’m not bleeding as well.
23	677	Also the cramps are INTENSE and super painful, enough to make me not eat.
23	678	I will tell you, during my years of growing up with having a menstrual cycle, I've not once experienced any form of cramps, but I did experience bloating and my cycle lasted about 7 days (the norm).
23	679	I experience all my period symptoms such as fatigue and cramps.
23	680	I actually haven't had my period once since I got the implant, nor have I experienced any spotting or cramps.
23	681	Just had it removed last week, emotionally I feel like myself again, however horrible cramps & morning sickness have been present.
23	682	I wanted to commit to the birth control, and I hoped that my cycle would become regular; instead, the rare week that I am not bleeding I have incredibly painful cramps.
23	683	I'd love for it to go away completely but it's made my time of the month way more tolerable - especially considering that I used to be nearly paralyzed by cramps alone.
23	684	Mid November I had a week where I had heavy breathing and flu symtoms light headache light cramps minor stomach pains nausea dizziness (its gone now except sinus congestion but it's clearing/ and some lightheadedness but bearable).
23	685	Cramps were out of this world, never got cramps before the birth control.
23	686	I have not had mood swings, cramps, or regular periods while I have had the implant the last 3 yrs.
23	687	I had mood swings again, cramps, semi-heavy period (much heavier than it was on bc), and I just feel yucky.
23	688	No cramps, some bleeding, mood swings, low sex drive (of course).
23	689	Constant diarrhea, skin rashes, break out, cramps, head aches, back pain, dizziness, nausea, fatigue.
23	690	The 2nd / 3rd week was hell, I felt nausea, aches, cramps, and going to classes was a chore.
23	691	I've had this in for around five months now , when I first got it in I bled so bad for the first two weeks I became anemic , the bleeding stopped eventually but my period were very irregular and random  I didn't bleed for around three months but I just got my period and I have the WORST cramps nonstop I feel nauseous and its never been like this before  it also made me gain a lot of weight, other than that its very easy insertion and you don't have to worry about it unlike the pill or other birth control methods  but I don't know how I'm feeling about it now
23	692	Irregular bleeding and spotting, cramps all the time, lower back ache, greasy skin and hair, anxiety (which I already had but this has made it worse).
23	693	The first year I thought it was a miracle birth control options, no period, no cramps, no real side effects.
23	694	From there I was fine, no cramps, no bleeding for 3 months.
23	695	And they felt like the worst cramps ever.
23	696	I literally just stayed in bed for the first 7 days and as 3 weeks before bleeding,  I experienced period cramps.
23	697	I  get cramps but not the normal period cramping.. it's down lower and hurts like hell :(.
23	698	Also does anyone else get severe cramps after an orgasm since you've had this implant?
23	699	3 months after getting the Nexplanon I stopped all periods, but still had all the cramps and side effects of a period.
23	700	Normally, my periods cramps are unbearable so I wanted to get Nexplanon to see if it would help.
23	701	When I recieved my period this month it was still as heavy and lasted for a day longer but I didn't have any cramps.
23	702	Little would I know the next 15 months would consist of ridiculous bleeding, headaches, cramps, heat flashes, and COUNTLESS embarrassing moments.
23	703	The second time it took away my period for the year no cramps or anything.
23	704	I had no mood swings, no pains, period regulated to 3-5 days light with no cramps; minor breast pain, but that's how I knew my menstrual was coming in a weeks time.
23	705	I would have a period for a couple of weeks every few months, but it was very light spotting with absolutely no cramps.
23	706	Period, and ovulation cramps are gone yay!
23	707	My cramps were painful like never before.
23	708	Extreme cramps, sick all the time.
23	709	I get nauseous, dizzy, head aches, cramps, and breast size fluctuations often.
23	710	Never really have cramps.
23	711	Then on Jan 2017 I was bleeding like the whole month then one week it stops and when I would start having sex it started again the bleeding and its has been like this ever since and now I have cramps almost everyday .My mood swings are so bad I can be happy and then angry for no reason.I have been to my obgyn she put on some pills estradol I believe it's called ,but did not help with the bleeding I'm going to have it removed I just have to make my appt.
23	712	Exactly 2 weeks after the insertion, I started what I thought was a period cause I had all my common PMS symptoms I usually deal with (heartburn, loss of appetite, light cramps), red and heavy blood flow for about 4 days.
23	713	My periods are horrible: cramps, random cycle lengths, never 28 days apart and random spotting.
23	714	Headaches and stomach cramps.
23	715	So far my period has been pretty much regular, I  have a lighter flow which is great and I get fewer cramps.
23	716	I've had no weight gain and my excruciating cramps and heavy menstruation are gone.
23	717	I also spotted lightly for five weeks straight but I stuck through it because having no cramps is worth it for me.
23	718	Have been really nauseous, have horrible cramps, lack of appetite.
23	719	The only real plus side is that I'm free of the dreadful cramps that used to make me cry before receiving the Nexplanon.
23	720	I see alot of people complain about bad period pains, cramps, etc.
23	721	I had two full periods back to back last month and the cramps were really intense.
23	722	I just got done bleeding for almost a week 3 days ago, went to the bathroom because of cramps and of course there was blood.
23	723	I tried this for about 4 months and at first it seemed to work fine, but then I started spotting almost all the time and my periods began to become irregular and lasted a for days longer with more intense cramps than I used to have.
23	724	I decided to have the rod removed because I don't like being so irregular and dealing with cramps that are more intense than the intense cramps I usually experienced without birth control.
23	725	No period cramps or spotting and I'm able to have sex without worry.
23	726	Mood swings are bad some times I get really bad cramps where I can't feel from my uterus down & headache are unbearable
23	727	cramps and extreme bloating but I never actually bled up until a little after 2 years.
23	728	Irregular light periods with very light cramps are a relief from heavy Endo symptoms which is a plus.
23	729	I had cramps during that time, but it was nothing unbearable.
23	730	No periods, no cramps, no mood swings, no weight gain, and lastly no babies!
23	731	My cramps are awful, my breasts are always sore, and I've had to up my medicine for depression and anxiety.
23	732	I got it more for the reason of hopefully stopping my normal period which was usually about 8-12 days every month, very heavy, with cramps so bad I'd usually have to sit in a hot bath for an hour to help.
23	733	I do however get the odd cramps but it just passes after 20 minutes.
23	734	Now I'm starting to have the brown discharge/spotting everyday, cramps, tender breasts, etc.
23	735	I've had some of the worst cramps of my life.
23	736	My period is not consistent, but I don't usually get cramps and it is typically light.
23	737	My anxiety got 10 times worse and I always had my period - literally for 22 days and then didn't for 5 days  and then got it again for 18 days and this would happen every month ... My boobs always hurt and I was always very tired.. My cramps got worse.
23	738	Over the years I have had very little bleeding, although I do get the symptoms of a period (mild cramps, tender breasts and over emotional at times) I'm due for a new implant in a couple of weeks but I'm considering not taking anything to see how my body reacts and regulates itself.
23	739	I have my period for about 3 weeks every month and it's not just spotting, it is extremely heavy, and I have cramps constantly.
23	740	It's Friday night now I am itching like mad and having horrible cramps!!
23	741	Even though period cramps suck and I have to suck it up now, it's better than bleeding 24/7 and your body acting crazy because of the hormones
23	742	My super painful period cramps stopped because I haven't had a period since I've had nexplanon.
23	743	I had a period 2 wks after I got it put in and it was the heaviest bleeding I've had and to top it I had awful cramps.
23	744	I never cramped during my regular menstrual cramps so this was weird.
23	745	Some days it'll be so bad that I even get cramps.
23	746	I get a period every month, usually lasting for 2 weeks and the cramps are bad.
23	747	Maybe every 6 months I spot a couple days and the plus no terrible cramps.
23	748	I've never been pregnant so I guess it does its job however when my body does send the message to me that I'm not pregnant  (my period) I'm bleeding for 2 weeks sometimes more, I use to have 4 day periods and would never experience cramps now I feel like my uterus is being pulled out of my vagina day in and day out and that's before the bleeding.
23	749	With nexplanon it stopped the cramps.
23	750	The first two months I spotted and had some cramps.
23	751	Now I have no period, no cramps, no spotting, and my mood changes are gone.
23	752	For the last 6 months I've been having heavy periods with spotting all the time and horrible cramps.
23	753	Irregular bleedings, pain, cramps and mood swings.
23	754	But what I can tell you is I've had some of the worst cramps of my life on this.
23	755	Sometimes it's regular cramps and sometimes it's so severe I throw up.
23	756	Headaches, constant bleeding, no sex drive, hair loss, weight gain, cramps, mood swings, depression.
23	757	I bleed really heavy for three weeks at a time of had it for six months and going to get it took out my  loosing  hair like crazy and cramps all the time.
23	758	I got the nexplanon late November before thanksgiving and I haven't gotten my period the next month only side affects I've been having is cramps just on and off and sometimes I feel this sharp pain in my back here and there or a headache which I don't get anymore.
23	759	I still get cramps and my back hurts a lot and I have gain a bunch of weight.
23	760	I've had terrible mood swings, terrible cramps , periods that arrive early, late or not at all.
23	761	Here's the thing iv always had painful very painful cramps.
23	762	And omg I was so happy when I got it my cramps went away I had no pain i felt like the luckiest girl in the world.
23	763	This help my cramps but bleeding for 3 years straight.
23	764	it controlled my severe cramps.
23	765	I've gained more than 40 pounds, I am severely depressed most of the time, I get these awful cramps but never a period, I'm nauseous a lot.
23	766	The first like year and 6 months I had no actual periods, but I would get emotional and have a few cramps but nothing too bad.
23	767	I've had this in for a little over a year and it took away the cramps but I still get back aches.
23	768	No cramps.
23	769	Sometimes I will still get cramps but NOTHING like they were before.
23	770	I used to get horrible period cramps, back pain, and headaches ever menstrual cycle and this birth control has taken it all away.
23	771	I have only gotten my period once throughout this whole year and it was very very light with no cramps.
23	772	I had constant bleeding for 7 months, cramps and headaches.
23	773	I get really bad cramps and im always nauseous and ive been throwing up more than usual.. my anxiety is through the roof.. i was 120 pounds when i got the implant and now im 105.. im trying to gain weight but still losing weight, it does prevent pregnancy really well but the side effects are to much for my body to handle, every woman is different.
23	774	I have never had pain period cramps except for the rare ones that would come once a year but this is every time I'm on my period and now my period can last for two to three weeks of this pain.
23	775	I have cramps very rarely but still do.
23	776	The cramps I get are unbearable, so if anyone wanted nexplanon.... don't even bother thinking about it.
23	777	My period stayed on for 9 days , I was depressed  all the time and my cramps were the worse .
23	778	After that I had my period every 2 weeks if not every other, cramps, headaches, and mood swings.
23	779	Bleeding has stopped, but severe cramps persist.
23	780	About 1 month later, I had the worst cramps EVER.
23	781	I get no cramps or mood swings and my cycles are very light and last 2-4 days at most.
23	782	I've hardly had any periods and the ones I've had were light with no cramps or mood swings.
23	783	So far light bleeding for two weeks then no bleeding but cramps
23	784	I have irregular periods but that's always been me so nothing new, I have no cramps what so ever and my periods is extremely light.
23	785	Light periods no cramps (normal for me) but more frequent.
23	786	Periods lasting 12-14 days cramps and all, and spotting the rest of the month almost completely non stop for over 18 months.
23	787	(Before being on bc i hardley ever experienced cramps & they were minor.
23	788	I have never experienced cramps like this, even when I messed up my cycle bad on the pill.
23	789	It was a constant bleeding, with minor cramps.
23	790	My cramps are just awful and they're newly accompanied by back pain.
23	791	before nexplanon My periods were as planned and with little to no cramps .
23	792	However with nexplanon I hAve had months with 2 periods and the worst cramps I have ever had along with back pain.
23	793	It's been almost 3 months now and I still do not bleed or get cramps.
23	794	The first month I got nexpanon on in my arm I had some bad side effects like back pain cramps and nausea  but after that first month I didn't have any other side effects I did have a longer period I usually had literally a 3 day period in the first month of using nexplanon on I had it for two weeks but then I would miss periods or they would be short and now I don't get them at all I think it takes up too atheist 3 months for it to settle in your body which is why I was having some bad side affects but now I love it and it really at depends on  your body as we are all so different  ...So before you decide to get rid of it wait at least 3 months and if you don't like it after that remove it try something else.
23	795	A month after I started bleeding very heavy and clots, lots of bad cramps and nausea.
23	796	I didn't have any bleeding or cramps for about the first 2/3 months.
23	797	I'm also getting bad cramps and horrible back pain.
23	798	Now I have no periods, no cramps, I feel completely normal, no weight gain, and it's great to know I'm protected without remembering the daily pill.
23	799	3 days ago I started bleeding, its been getting heavier and the cramps in my abdomen and lower back are terrible, much worse than my usual period.
23	800	First time was in 2012-2015; first time experience was great, no period, no cramps, weight gain or weird pains, I couldn't even feel it.
23	801	It definitely did it's job so I give it 5 stars & I also barely ever bleed & no cramps or weigh gain, but between the lowered sex drive & the depression & constant moodiness, it's time for it to go.
23	802	The cramps are unbearable,  it feels like a knife to my stomach.
23	803	During extremely stressful times, I get nonstop heavy bleeding accompanied by cramps.
23	804	I have no horrible cramps, no headaches, and no nausea.
23	805	And I'm not talking spotting I'm talking period like bleeding with cramps.
23	806	I cannot stop sweating and had bad cramps during my period.
23	807	I've had what I like to call ghost periods where I don't bleed but I have crippling cramps, pms, headaches and fatigue.
23	808	It honestly didn't bother me because I didn't get the terrible cramps I was accustomed to and the spotting lasted maybe a month and a half and now I'm clear again.
23	809	My period was wicked heavy, lots of painful cramps to the point where I couldn't go to school.
23	810	Slight slight cramps.
23	811	And now, six months into the b/c, I have spotting and cramps nearly everyday.
23	812	but here's the thing that has me really worried, in the beggining of this month I started to work out and lift weights!, after a week of working out super hard, I started getting sore nipples, bloating , and cramps for A WHOLE MONTH (No blood tho) until 2 days ago the blood has came out and it's thick and painful like a regular period!
23	813	I have been bleeding for 3 weeks straight with horrifying cramps that make me nauseous.
23	814	Other than that, I have no cramps so this thing is an ok for me.
23	815	Cons: weight gain/excessive appetite, nonstop mood swings, anger, depression, lack of motivation, random severe cramps.
23	816	Then nonstop bleeding and cramps.
23	817	I have had cramps off and on for a month I have a period for over a week stop for 3 days and starts again for another week and horrible mood swings.
23	818	After that I didn't have much issue; I do get occasional brown spotting spells with heavy cramps, and random sore breasts for a few days.
23	819	I had 1 day of bad cramps, bled for literally 5 minutes then just cramped all day.
23	820	Before the implants my periods would last 8 days cause me to have severe cramps, migraine, painful breast, and low appetite.
23	821	My periods have been great (coming from someone who had heavy period and cramps that would make me sick to my stomach).
23	822	My cramps are so bad that I'm crying on my bed all day.
23	823	I had it taken out weeks ago bc I bled 3 wks out of the month for a few months with horrible breast tenderness and cramps like never before.
23	824	Before implanon I would skip 2 or 3 months of my cycle then it would just hit me like a train bleed for a month straight, excruciating cramps, and never regular!
23	825	My periods happen about every 6 months and it wasn't until January that my period lasted for almost 3 months with horrible cramps.
23	826	It was really light and only lasted about 5 days, but the first few days I had really bad cramps.
23	827	a month later the continuous bleeding got heavier and I have cramps and have to take midol 24/7.
23	828	I haven't gotten a period, but I often get cramps.
23	829	My bleeding won't stop been two weeks and my cramps have become worse and lasted a whole week.
23	830	During my periods I had intense cramps and heavy bleeding.That's why I chose the convenience of this birth control.I got my inplant put in July 31st 2015.
23	831	I got it because my cramps would so bad I would have to leave school, and my periods were really heavy.
23	832	I originally got it because my period cramps were so bad that I would faint from the pain, and I had been on the pill but didn't like having to take it everyday.
23	833	After my period stops for a few days I have very bad cramps when it comes back.
23	834	On the plus side I have had no cramps!
23	835	It started off great, light spotting, not pregnant, less cramps.
23	836	I didn't have any cramps, my mood was back to normal, I didn't feel tired anymore!
23	837	My cramps have been the worst they've ever been since my bleeding began.
23	838	I do get very mild cramps and weird cravings around the time I usually get my period.
23	839	The first thing that happened was painful cramps and prolonged bleeding, my libido completely ceased to exist and I was uninterested in sex, I noticed the weight gain, gained about 10-15lb already!
23	840	I feel bloated often but not too bad with cramps but I didn't suffer very bad cramps before insertion.
23	841	Yes starting out I got cramps and I have had a light period for two weeks.
23	842	I have struggled with cramps constantly, and finally got a HORRIBLE period that lasted for two weeks after the first year.
23	843	I had it inserted July 2014, removed April 2015, and I'm still dealing with the side effects today - I'm now being treated for painful cysts and debilitating cramps, and I'm convinced this drug caused them.
23	844	I just started my period today and I must say the cramps I got made me feel like I was in labor.
23	845	If you have severe period cramps like I did, I would definitely reccommend.
23	846	Sharp breast pains, terrible cramps, my hair is disgustingly oily now.
23	847	Please read: The first couple months were so great, no periods, no cramps, no nothing.
23	848	I tried implanon in 2010 because I was on the pill prior and that whole ordeal made me feel disgusting with stomach upset, weight gain, painful cramps.
23	849	I never experience cramps while on implanon.
23	850	I went on it because I had very 7-8 day heavy bleeding, hormonal breakouts, bloating, and light cramps.
23	851	Gaining weight, depression, back pain and cramps!
23	852	Sex what's that this makes me sick to think about being touched.but I did get it removed today I will say I'm having serious leg cramps just like I did when I first got it..at that time I blamed it on work but I'm now shown it was from the BC ..Don't get it!
23	853	Awful cramps too!
23	854	It was very heavy (never had cramps in my life) stopped after 2 weeks, then started again the end of November and stopped after 2 weeks.
23	855	I constantly have cramps and headaches and sometimes heat flashes.
23	856	I get angry over the smallest things and I constantly have cramps and headaches.
23	857	I do get random cramps from time to time, but that's because I also have ovary cysts.
23	858	No weight gain, no period, barely any cramps.
23	859	Then I started getting worst cramps then I had before, which were bad already.
23	860	Spotting is putting it mildly I have had normal discharge to brown discharge stomach pains cramps much worse than usual period pains which have always been bad Blood clots!
23	861	I randomly get cramps but no period.
23	862	The worst menstrual pains ever to where the first 3 days is just cramps to where I can barely move and my doctor told me that since I was on the shot for so long that since it stopped my periods that if I do the implant I wouldn't orally ever get it well that b.s.
23	863	I became insanely bloated and had terrible cramps.
23	864	The hormone change has been better for me - after a decade on the pill in varying forms, my mood swings are improved, though my cramps are still hellish.
23	865	However, since I started Nexplanon, my body has reacted as such: 1) my periods last for about 23 days or more when on my former birth control, they lasted only 3 days 2) My face breaks out during my cycle, which didn't happen on my former BC 3) I never got cramps during my natural menstrual cycle or on my former birth control, but I get cramps on Nexplanon; during certain times I would cramp after orgasming oh, and it lowered my sex drive.
23	866	All the symptoms of a pregnancy without being pregnant, the WORST migraines and periods that can last 2 days/2 months and even in a lucky streak with no period that month I still experience all the pains and cramps of a period without the blood.
23	867	I will still get the weird sweet/salty craving that I had normally, but no cramps or blood.
23	868	I got this implanted because I was put on accutane and I've had no bad side effects at all, the only thing was a couple days after I got it implanted I got my period which lasted for 21 days and haven't gotten it since which is always good for me considering I always get really bad cramps when I'm on it.
23	869	Iv gained weight, I have really bad mood swings, I have bad cramps in my stomach, I have cravings, my breast enlarged big time, and it makes my arm hurt.
23	870	I get my periods about every 2-3 months but the cramps are horribly painful.
23	871	I was beyond happy no longer having a period and not having cramps or mood swings.
23	872	I used to have terrible cramps monthly and now I have none.
23	873	At first I had no complaints but the 3rd month I noticed frequent periods having them about twice a month with horrible cramps.
23	874	I've had cramps, headaches & been more tired than usual.
23	875	Called Obgyn & she recommended take 800mg ibuprofen to ease cramps & decrease flow (since it is heavier than normal period).
23	876	I got this birth control March 24th 2015, and shortly after I got heavy bleeding, cramps and mood swings, my anxiety worsened severely.
23	877	It's almost been a year since I've had this birth control and my periods are finally starting to regulate, I have no cramps at all anymore, and I have no anxiety at all anymore.
23	878	The 5th month and up until  today, my cycle starts with cramps, fatigue, and nausea like it would normally if I weren't on birth control and the bleeding is light and lasts about a week.
23	879	I haven't had any other noticeable side effects and it did help with my cramps, which used to be awful...but the cost of tampons and always having to carry them around with me isn't worth it.
23	880	No cramps no weight gain and no pregnancy so far.
23	881	BUT when I did have my period, I had no cramps or back pain, it was astonishing.
23	882	I did experience very mild cramps at the very end 1-2 out of 10 pain wise.
23	883	I haven't gotten my period since then, I don't bloat, no headaches and no cramps.
23	884	The only thing is I experienced cramps, but I get them anyway so that wasn't a bother for me.
23	885	Violent cramps, and so so so so moody.
23	886	Haven't really had any symptoms of course besides weight gain, cramps and when I switched to the nexplanon I was on my period 2 months straight but other than that great birth control.
23	887	I've bled 3 weeks out of every month since I got it, constantly have a headache, nausea, weight gain, always bleeding, period cramps are worse than I had before I got the implant, all around terrible.
23	888	I bleed for up to two weeks at a time, although no cramps.
23	889	I felt I was getting depressed and extreme cramps.
23	890	It has made me so weak & the cramps have been nauseating.
23	891	I had minor stomach cramps (coming from a person who never had menstrual cramps) .
23	892	I used to have very painful cramps and heavy bleeding but since getting the implant my periods have been a lot lighter.
23	893	The flow was heavy, the cramps were harsher then normal, and would last an entire week.
23	894	Intense PMS symptoms like I never experienced before, cramps that would render me useless, and just general fatigue and moodiness for an entire week, every other week.
23	895	Its very heavy with very heavy clotting and serious cramps.
23	896	Non stop bleeding and cramps for the last 4 months.
23	897	It obviously does its job preventing pregnancy, but it really helped my terrible PMS cramps.
23	898	I haven't gotten any cramps or any pains.
23	899	And I feel tired all the the time also have real bad stomach cramps
23	900	Horrible cramps and headaches.
23	901	When my period comes my back hurts really bad and I get really bad cramps.
23	902	I still go through cramps and PMS and the constant headaches are a pain.
23	903	I had regular periods; they were light, lasted 4 days, and no cramps!
23	904	After the first couple of months my periods started to be irregular, severe cramps started.
23	905	No cramps though.
23	906	& now it's back with a vengeance, the worst cramps & heaviest bleeding I've ever experienced.
23	907	I also no longer have debilitating cramps since I don't menstruate
23	908	I don't get cramps but my periods are heavier than before.
23	909	Last week I started passing clots and bleeding extra heavy, the cramps were out of this world.
23	910	this is ridiculous I've been on my period for almost 2 weeks I'm super emotional and I get really bad cramps and I've been SUPER heavy.
23	911	Anyways, it stopped my migraines and headaches I didn't have cramps much anymore, I use to wear night pads during the day because of how heavy my flow was and now I get my period maybe every 3 months and its only for a couple of days.
23	912	I like not having cycles and painful cramps.
23	913	I never had a heavy period or bad cramps but I do now.
23	914	I am so getting it again and I don't have cramps or any bloating when I get my period also not heavy.
23	915	Doubled over with cramps I can't even get out of bed.
23	916	Instead, I had the worst freaking cramps ever!
23	917	I have the worst mood swings and cramps ever.
23	918	The first few months were fine, period was lighter and not as often, but now almost a year later I have gained a bunch of weight, I have started to have horrible breakouts on my face, neck, and back, my cramps are horrible and i have probably had two weeks off of bleeding since the start of July (it's now September) I'm going to talk to my doctor but my man and I are over this implant.
23	919	At first, I had irregular spotting, no cramps or mood swings.
23	920	I have had nexplanon since February of 2015, it was great at first when I got it, no periods, no cramps, nothing.
23	921	Awful cramps and mood swings came with this period and it lasted longer than any period I had ever had before.
23	922	Then my period started coming twice a month with horrific cramps.
23	923	I was on 3 weeks, with super bad cramps, off ONE WEEK and its been 2 weeks on again and the cramps are horrifying.
23	924	I have had nexplanon since December 2013, and I've put on 90 pounds, I have had terrible mood swings, more severe anxiety, depression, sleep problems, migraines, super sweaty, abdominal swelling and far worse cramps than without, and my breasts actually grew even bigger which is actually not good... And to top it off, I'm almost constantly on my period.
23	925	With the IUD I had terrible cramps and my first period went on for about a month.
23	926	I get cramps occasionally but not even annoying enough to take ibuprofen.
23	927	No period no cramps.
23	928	I got it put in early July and after a week i started spotting then bleeding and stop then spot ik its been over a month since i had it but i hate it i spot it all the time i am ready to already get it out i don't recommended it i haven't gained weight yet i did have minor cramps when inserting it they do numb u so u cant feel it
23	929	I have had only one full on period accompanied with Mood swings, headaches, bad cramps, and heavy flow.
23	930	No period or cramps or weight gain.
23	931	I do still get the mild cramps, aches and pains....but I really can't Complain.
23	932	Which is awesome for me since I had very bad cramps during that time.
23	933	I've had for over a year now, and at first I had no bleeding, no weight gain, now I'm gaining weight like crazy, and have been on period for around 2 months, and unlike most people it's a full blown period, with cramps!
23	934	The worst cramps of my life.
23	935	I got the implant put in on the last day of my period and I haven't gotten it since nor have I gotten any cramps.
23	936	It is almost six months in and I'm still having stomach cramps and bleeding and mood swings and everything else...I'm sick of it now!
23	937	I have had the Nexplanon in for about 2 1/2 years and I could go months without my period which I loved but when I get it it will last for weeks and I will have bad cramps and PMS.
23	938	I've been spotting/had my period for the last 3 months and i don't think its stopping anytime soon, and I've recently started to get back and stomach cramps everyday also.
23	939	who wants to bleed for months straight and have bad cramps?!?!
23	940	in 2012 when I was 22 and I think its brilliant like that could never remember to take the pill and could never find a method of contraception that suited me the pill made me gain a lot of weight I was very moody and got very bad cramps...with the implant I spotted for the first week and haven't had a period since never gained weight my bust got bigger which is a good thing!
23	941	It cause unbelievable headaches & cramps!
23	942	I don't get cramps or bloating anymore, but I went up a cup size in the first month on it!
23	943	The cramps have not really been painful and my bleeding has been lighter than normal,  but still!
23	944	Before I got that period I had the worst cramps I've ever had.
23	945	No cramps, no bleeding, no worrying about it.
23	946	Before, I would always have a pretty heavy flow and horrible cramps, but since I got the implant, I've had little to no cramping, and fairly light periods.
23	947	I have now had this for 22 days and I just started experiencing cramps and a heavier reddish flow.
23	948	Since it's been spotting and light cramps, until recently now I also have ruthless cramps and periods.
23	949	I've had nausea, painful cramps, tender breast,  Weight gain and fatigue.
23	950	I also have stomach cramps a couple of days out of the week.
23	951	I have either been spotting with cramps 90% of the time.
23	952	I'm having mild cramps at this very moment but nothing too painful.
23	953	I'm 19 and currently undergoing A2 exams and this has meant that I don't have to worry about cramps or periods throughout the exam time.
23	954	I had miserable cramps and psycho mood swings for about two months.
23	955	By the time of my third period I had no spotting or bleeding at all and the cramps mood swings were subsiding.
23	956	Didn't have a period the first month, next month bleed for two weeks no cramps or anything.
23	957	I don't get bad cramps or anything.
23	958	I never had a period, no cramps, no headaches,  no mood swings.
23	959	I still get cramps and I gained 20 lbs.
23	960	And I've always had bad cramps during menstrual cycle but now it's all the time and twice as bad sometimes.
23	961	I occasionally get cramps but that's it.
23	962	I am having extreme migranes, nausea, cramps, mood swings and dizziness.
23	963	I have this birth control I got it on my six week check up back in 2013 at first it was wonderful it didn't completely stop my cycle but it was every other month BUT when I did get it it would last for 7-10 days heavy an cramps then I would come off an a few days later come right back on for like 5 days but then won't get a cycle for two months now I'm getting pain in my arm mood swings depressed an eat a lot of snacks haven't picked up any weight though.
23	964	Now my period just doesn't come at all yet I still get the horrible cramps often.
23	965	I always have cramps and feel bloated, I have gained 25lbs!
23	966	I have experienced 20lb weight gain since, severe cramps, depression, nonexistent libido and nauseousness.
23	967	Then no spotting or periods, no cramps or any other of my usual symptoms.
23	968	One is worse than the other, heavy, cramps and overall fatigue.
23	969	I haven't had any cramps.
23	970	But I have actually lost weight, no cramps, no heavy flow.
23	971	I won't have a period for months but when I do its heavy and the cramps are terrible.
23	972	It's not heavy at all and I don't have any cramps at all, it's just annoying to have to wear a panty liner and tampon every day because I'm not sure if it's going to be heavier than usual.
23	973	I haven't had a single period and my cramps are gone.
23	974	I got Nexplanon for birth control as well as to control my cramps.
23	975	I do have mood swings though not nearly as bad and my cramps have vanished and believe me, mine were awful.
23	976	I am always spotting and if I'm not spotting its because I am having a 10 day period with the worst cramps known to man.
23	977	Now it's starting to get annoying because I keep spotting for a long time this month and my cramps really do take a lot out me.
23	978	And my cramps are awful this time.
23	979	Didn't bleed or spot till when my period was supposed to come and it was not a regular period it was much lighter but I did get bad cramps.
23	980	Along with that came the cramps.
23	981	I feel fine though, no cramps or anything, but for some reason I keep losing weight but that might not be the implant.
23	982	It's not heavy, and I don't experience any cramps.
23	983	I had the worst cramps before.
23	984	I was dealing with very long extremely heavy and severe cramps.
23	985	I have had NO PERIODS since day of implant, no arm pain, cramps, weight loss/gain, or mood swings!
23	986	I just started my period and my cramps are pretty terrible.
23	987	Don't get much of a period but I get bloated and heavy cramps when I'm supposed to be on it.
23	988	My periods have stopped and all I have is a few cramps around the time I would have had one.
23	989	I started being nausea, headache and had terrible cramps.
23	990	Also, my cramps are horrible now and my lower backs been in pain for about 2 weeks now.
23	991	Got my cycle in December it was light and minor cramps.
23	992	I got the Nexplanon due to having bad cramps, I feel nothing which is amazing.
23	993	As for cramps, that's the main reason I was interested in this because I'm one of the ones that has horrible cramps and this took it all away.
23	994	The flow itself was light, and I didn't experience cramps, nausea, nor migraines.
23	995	Other then that period was normal the first year, second year the period was lasting 8+ days, spotting, towards middle of second year my arm has been going numb, it seems to be on a nerve, it will cause cramp like pain starting at the birth control site all the way down to my fingers, extreme lower abd pain and lots of migraines and headaches.
23	996	Sometimes I would even cramp like a on a regular period.
23	997	I don't cramp, haven't gotten my regular period [yet] its not due yet, but dealing without my regular ovulation pain is amazing.
23	998	I don't usually cramp so I can't say much about that.
23	999	I had one big cramp a week after I started but that was it.
23	1000	Yes I do not have a period nor do I cramp at all but I hate this birth control.
23	1001	I do cramp even if i get no cycle but doesn't bother me.
23	1002	Maybe until May of 2015 I would cramp and my breasts would get tender like I was going to start my period; however, I never did.
23	1003	I cramp now and I never used to.
23	1004	Before this, I was relatively cramp free and my periods were very light.
23	1005	I cramp horribly now, and I never did before.
23	1006	I had a single cramp the night before I got it, like a warning sign, and then had my period for 10 days.
23	1007	I switched to this birth control from being on the depo,because I was doing fine till it was like my 3rd shot and I started to bleed and cramp so heavy then usual and nothing was stopping it so I switched to this birth control and so far everything was good till it hid the 3rd month mark and that's when I'm started to spot and later on bleed.
23	1008	Here it is 6 weeks later this Friday and i'm still spotting and now slightly starting to cramp.
23	1009	I bloat, cry, bleed, cramp, and can't sleep everyday.
23	1010	I constantly feel bloated and sharp cramp even when I'm not on my period.
23	1011	I guess you should consider my period regular, but it sucks bc I'm in pain for so long (the implant has not reduced my cramp severity).
23	1012	I don't get my cycle any more but I cramp bad as he'll and that's the only reason I got it.
23	1013	It was light and I didn't cramp.
23	1014	I randomly bleed as well as cramp horribly before I start.
23	1015	I get very light bleeding every six months for 1-2 days but I will say the cramping is insane.
23	1016	No noticeable weight gain, minimal cramping, and only spotting instead of a full-on period.
23	1017	But things have changed this week... For the first time since getting the implant I am having a period that is lasting several days, the cramping isn't terrible but I have lost all control of my emotions.
23	1018	I start with spotting on Monday, Tuesday-Thursday is an extremely heavy period with very bad cramping, and Friday/Saturday it usually winds down.
23	1019	My period was super super light and I had almost no cramping which is an absolute miracle for me.
23	1020	I started having periods every two weeks and cramping.
23	1021	So far I've had it for about 2 months and only had spotting and slight cramping.
23	1022	I've had no bleeding or cramping at all.
23	1023	I get very light cramping every now and then, but not to the point to make me uncomfortable.
23	1024	Although I didn’t gain weight or break out, I was constantly cramping and PMSing.
23	1025	Imagine being on a heavy flowing cramping ovarian cyst period for 3 years.
23	1026	I had less cramping.
23	1027	Then after the 6 month period passed, I started gradually gaining weight, having my periods more often (sometimes 2 times in a month), have major cramping, headaches, mood swings from hell.
23	1028	I had horrible cramping, headaches and bled for 3 entire months, nonstop.
23	1029	My period completely stopped until January of 2017 when I experienced cramping and spotting.
23	1030	The first side effect was the constant cramping.
23	1031	I got nexplanon after my surprise son and had no periods for a year however I had no sex drive, it was painful even, and cramping but no period.
23	1032	I haven't gained any weight, no cramping, and no worries about taking a pill at the same time everyday!
23	1033	I have no sex drive anymore and seriously I bleed heavily, with heavy clots and severe cramping for weeks at a time so even if I did I couldn't have sex.
23	1034	I first had Nexplanon implanted in April 2015 because of my heavy and painful cramping.
23	1035	I have been on Nexplanon for only 2 weeks, the first week I was fine and the only side effects I was getting was hair loss and cramping.
23	1036	I always had a heavy period and this totally helped with cramping and my period, I didn't have one for 2 years then the final 3rd year it was light periods monthly.
23	1037	Before I got the implant I did have very bad cramping, I experienced very light to zero cramping.
23	1038	No bleeding or anything yet, but some slight and constant cramping.
23	1039	All in all I love it my period only lasted 3 days I had mostly cramping and no bleeding I can really deal with this bc for 3 years....
23	1040	I have had a period going on 4 months now with extremely painful cramping.
23	1041	We have had no side effects, cramping, or depression which we experienced while on the pill.
23	1042	No crazy bleeding patterns, helped monumentally with my moodiness and cramping.
23	1043	This cycle was different than my typical cycle, for I no longer had cramping or migraines.
23	1044	No cramping, nothing crazy.
23	1045	I'm forever cramping as if I'm on my period.
23	1046	I'm not cramping or bloated like a period my bleeding went from medium light to heavy real quick.
23	1047	The first 4 months were good, I still got my period on time, it wasn't as heavy, no cramping.
23	1048	Within the last month my cramping is horrible, I feel like I have cysts on my ovaries again.
23	1049	Also slight cramping that never really goes away.
23	1050	It's effectively eliminated my bloating, cramping, mood swings, and I have far less blood sugar drops.
23	1051	I had a slight gain in inches specially in breast size but I am free of periods now and no cramping.
23	1052	When I first got it, I had my period (in August), then I had no period in September, and October through now I have been on my period non-stop with cramping occasionally.
23	1053	I began to have heavy bleeding with lots of menstrual cramping.
23	1054	It's actually gotten heavier like a normal period and I'm having a lot of cramping.
23	1055	To solve my cramping, pain, & bleeding my OBGYN switched brands of bc until we found the best one for me.
23	1056	So from Dec 8 to Dec 14 I had my cycle so for 3 days no bleeding or spotting of any kind then all of a sudden on Dec 19 I started spotting brown/old blood and that is still continuing and now I'm starting to get cramping with it and the blood is starting to turn a brighter red.
23	1057	Traditionally, and for most of my life, I've had horrendous cramping and long heavy cycles- it was the norm for me to not be able to get out of bed for at least one day a month if I didn't end up in the ER (useless).
23	1058	I didn't notice any difference in my period (same cramping, back aches, etc.)
23	1059	I know paragard causes longer and heavier periods with worse cramping, but that actually doesn't sound so bad after my nexplanon experience.
23	1060	More recently, I've experienced severe cramping for multiple days in a row.
23	1061	About a month ago to two months I started to get very bad cramping to the point where no medicine would work I had to sit in the pain for the 10-60 second pain that was going on.
23	1062	I switched over from the IUD (crazy spotting, some cramping, I could feel it in my uterus which made me nervous, and my partner got really irritated by the strings during sex) and the immediate changes were great.
23	1063	Very little after I had the Implant Nexplanon put in, I started bleeding black blood with cramping for now 10 weeks plus.
23	1064	I started with the implanon version for about three years; it was great with an occasional bad cramping.
23	1065	The cramping is horrendous at times, lasting two weeks or off and on regularly.
23	1066	Light cramping and no period or spotting.
23	1067	The only thing is that I HAVE had a little random cramping, but nothing ibuprofen can't fix.
23	1068	My last period I did experience some cramping.
23	1069	I still haven't gotten a period but I did experience minor cramping.
23	1070	For the first 6 months i experienced no bleeding with some cramping.
23	1071	My period before was heavy with light to medium cramping.
23	1072	I was excited when I stopped bleeding with no cramping from April until now, August 2016.
23	1073	I've been experiencing some spotting, cramping and a little moody lately.Hopefully that will stop soon.
23	1074	I only had a little bit of nausea and cramping the day after insertion.
23	1075	I have had the nexplanon since June 12,2015... before nexplanon I was on depo.. since having nexplanon I only had mild cramping...
23	1076	I switched from depo to nexplanon because it just seemed easier than going to dr every 3 months for the depo shot... the mild cramping only last a few months and have had no other problems since...
23	1077	I did have a lot of headaches and I kind of felt pregnant sometimes (sore breasts, cramping, fatigue, nausea).
23	1078	Yeah I experienced some cramping and bad headaches but I was fine.
23	1079	I have horrible mood swings and cramping.
23	1080	The first few weeks were great, I got this so Id stop having such heavy, cramping and painful periods.
23	1081	In the beginning the bleeding was minimal, and I had no cramping or pain!
23	1082	I am hoping that my body is just getting use to it and the cramping will stop.
23	1083	I get a very light period for 5-7 days about every 2-3 months or so and I do get cramping my first day but nothing a few aleve doesn't fix.
23	1084	I did have bad cramping starting two days after it was inserted, but it only lasted two days and I am assuming it was my body adjusting to the new medication that was being released in my body.
23	1085	I haven't had any cramping or spotting since the first week and I recommend it to all my friends.
23	1086	At first I did not get a period for 3 months and I did have some cramping and mood swings, but after 3 months my body adjusted to the new birth control, and I started getting a normal short period each month.
23	1087	My periods are progressively LIGHT, MINIMAL cramping, but  just last 9 days >:( but i get one every 45-60 days.
23	1088	My cramping has worsened to a point where I can't move.
23	1089	And I have bad cramping with it.
23	1090	The worst part was the severe cramping the 2 weeks before I had a period.
23	1091	The whole 40 days I had continuous bleading and spontaneous cramping.
23	1092	I also had headaches and cramping the first two months but that has also diminish.
23	1093	I haven't had a period since March of 2013, no spotting, no cramping.
23	1094	My nexplanon expires in December of 2016, and beginning in late January I started severly spotting, and incredibly severe cramping.
23	1095	The only plus side is minimal cramping.
23	1096	Now the problem with nexplanon: I have horrible cramping and pain that lasts up to a week sometimes.
23	1097	I haven't had any weight gain and I was diagnosed with migraines when I was little so I get them anyways, I've had no mood swings or cramping whatsoever!
23	1098	So far no other negative side effects aside from the bleeding (moderate) and moderate cramping.
23	1099	I've had nexplanon for a month now and I absolutely hate it I have had terrible abdominal pain long periods bad cramping, extreme mood swings and it hurt like hell the day after I got it.
23	1100	Every now and then I get slight cramping like I am going to get my period but I never actually get it, just slight spotting every 6 months or so for about a day but that is it.
23	1101	Cons of the Implant (for me): Acne (mild, but several forms, including cystic to my cheeks, chin and around my mouth), fatigue, hair thinning (but stopped at the 3 month mark), constantly sore (but not swollen) breasts, light cramping (daily).
23	1102	I have horrible cramping though.
23	1103	I never once had a period nor spotting while on Nexplanon, I did however have headaches, migraines, horrific mood swings, no sex drive, no motivation, depression, cramping, and arm pain.
23	1104	Now 4 months after removal I still suffer from these same side effects only add on severe cramping without having a period, in and out of hospitals for chronic nausea, ovarian cysts, and stuff doctors haven't even been able to pin point.
23	1105	I have constant weeks of excruciating cramping with maybe 2 day breaks in between.
23	1106	It started VERY heavy, with terrible cramping and then went back and forth between light spotting and mild bleeding but still hasn't stopped completely.
23	1107	I've never had regular periods and they always been light or moderate with only minimal cramping.
23	1108	Headaches, mood swings, weight gain, extreme bleeding, horrible cramping.
23	1109	I still have normal mood swings, bloating and cramping , but nothing like what I've read in some of the reviews.
23	1110	Sometimes it's a full heavy period sometimes its spotting but it's always painful and heavy cramping.
23	1111	Then my libido started to come back along with my period for three weeks, with intense cramping, mood swings, night sweats and swelling lymph glands.
23	1112	About four months after the insertion, I'm getting a full duration period every two weeks, like clockwork, and my PMS symptoms (irritability, lack of appetite, cramping and diarrhea) are back with a vengeance each time.
23	1113	I originally got it for period pains and I have had no cramping since.
23	1114	I no longer experience nausea or cramping.
23	1115	I typically don't get bad cramping, though it's still there.
23	1116	Heavy cramping?
23	1117	So the only complaint is the cramping making me miserable, it's effectiveness and the type of birth control it is good enough reason for me to leave it be.
23	1118	It went just like my regular period lasting 4 days but I didn't have and cramping or major break outs during this time like usual, the only thing that was different was I spotted for 6 days after that.
23	1119	Every month I get a slightly feeling of cramping but no menstrual.
23	1120	I've had this implant for about 2 1/2 weeks now and have not had bleeding, cramping, or any other that other stuff, but what I do have a serious pain at the injection site.
23	1121	I never had any period symptoms or cramping, just the bleeding.
23	1122	These last two months I have had my period consistantly, cramping, weight gain, sharp pain at injection site, and increased amounts of ovarian cysts.
23	1123	I got mine in August of 2014 the first week I had terrible mood swings and cramping but after that I had my period once again then it was every other month but then I had for ALL of December and it started every other month again but now in April I had my period for one week but I have been non-stop spotting for 2!
23	1124	No cramping or spotting.
23	1125	It's not enough to be a full blown period but I have had painful cramping the first 5 days, more than with my normal period.
23	1126	I have occasional spotting and cramping but the usually only lasts a day.
23	1127	No cramping at all since getting it.
23	1128	Have had worse cramping than I used to have.
23	1129	Two weeks later it started again with heavy bleeding and cramping.
23	1130	Minor abdominal cramping, but that's it (:
23	1131	I am just now having some slight brown discharge and cramping, but it isn't too concerning and I assume it will stop in the next few days.
23	1132	I've had slight cramping but nothing out of the ordinary associated with that.
23	1133	I also don't get cramping at the level I used to get it.
23	1134	No more cramping, but I am getting some nausea around the time of the spotting, but nothing major.
23	1135	I do get the symptoms of being on my cycle, such as cramping and bloating, back aches, but no bleeding.
23	1136	A week from insertion I bled nonstop, the longest time not bleeding was about 5 days and my longest period was about 47 days of heavy crampy bleeding.
23	1137	My first period was a bit longer but way less crampy.
23	1138	I still get a little crampy each month, and migraines.
23	1139	When I get my period I'm never moody or crampy.
23	1140	I usually always feel crampy now.
23	1141	After getting it put in I had my regular period the following month with a few days of spotting but nothing major.
23	1142	So far it’s usually a two week long period with mostly spotting about every other month, sometimes shorter or longer in between.
23	1143	From giving birth in January and waiting 3 months I was about to call quits and get the nexplanon removed due to spotting.
23	1144	I didn't have any bleeding up until my regularly scheduled period but when the period ended I continued to have lingering spotting.
23	1145	Had it implanted in June and it is now mid December and I have been spotting since the day I got it.
23	1146	I was on it for six months and I only had maybe 3 weeks of that where I wasn’t spotting or full on bleeding.
23	1147	I was lightly spotting over the entire course of being on Nexplanon, & although it was very annoying at first I eventually got used to it.
23	1148	Couple more days went by, and I started spotting.
23	1149	The spotting was legit dark brown blood.
23	1150	The first 6 months with this I had a little spotting, not much.
23	1151	I got it inserted in July of 2017 and I spotted for a month when August came I had no period no spotting I thought things were going good!!!!
23	1152	I am now on day 9 since this period stated and I am still randomly spotting fresh blood... my theory is that the breastfeeding has been suppressing my period and now that has almost stopped they have returned.. although by the looks of things between that and the Nexplanon they are all over the place.
23	1153	I experience normal spotting for the first few weeks, nothing abnormal.
23	1154	I was nonstop spotting, had inflammation down there 3 different times, and the worst mood swings.
23	1155	Inserted 9/'17 after my period, the next month it's still in regular time frame just light spotting (still is).
23	1156	My period ended shortly as it has when I was on the pill and I haven't had any spotting at all so far.
23	1157	After my period stopped I continued spotting for over a month.
23	1158	The only thing I dislike right now is that I keep spotting, I'm hoping it'll go away soon.
23	1159	I haven’t gotten pregnant, I had some spotting during the first two months but never had my period again.
23	1160	I was bleeding heavily to the point where I was clotting and I couldn’t tell if I was spotting or if it was my period.
23	1161	The only thing is I get a lot of spotting but it doesn’t bother me because I just wear panty liners every day.
23	1162	Sometimes the spotting stops for months at a time and I get pregnancy symptoms like breast soreness and lower back pain, which can really freak me out but the spotting always comes back.
23	1163	I didn't have any spotting after my normal 3 day period, my mood has been wayy better, & I have actually lost weight.
23	1164	The main side effect that was bothersome was the daily spotting.
23	1165	The spotting ranged from a heavy period flow to a smaller lighter flow.
23	1166	My OBGYN recommended multiple options to stop the spotting, however nothing helped.
23	1167	Three days after it ended I started spotting brown stuff.
23	1168	After a month of that I went back to the doctor to see if they could do anything and they gave me the pill to cancel out the spotting.
23	1169	After two weeks of taking the pill I didn’t stop bleeding so the doctor said take two pills and it finally stopped spotting.
23	1170	She said two days after you stop spotting stop taking the pills so I did.
23	1171	First few months I spotted for 2 weeks, no spotting 1 week and the cycle continued.
23	1172	I don't have to worry about taking a pill every day or picking up prescription on time, insertion was quick and easy (Planned Parenthood) and I did have spotting a few months (for 10 days, then 12 days) but other than that my period has disappeared which is nice.
23	1173	Had it put in right after giving birth first five months while I was exclusively breastfeeding were ok I would get a period that was longer than usual with spotting between then the last 3 months when my baby started solids  and as my hormones changed it became awful I was heavy bleeding for nearly three months straight - blood clots and all.
23	1174	I was spotting most of the month following my period.
23	1175	It was horrible, would not stop bleeding, not spotting, downright blood gushing and blood clots, it's a side effect to seek medical help but doctor said "ride it out for 6 mos" Thats insane!!!!
23	1176	I get random spotting that lasts a day or 2 but its barely nothing and I am still able to have sex.
23	1177	I thought it was because I was wearing tampons for the spotting but I stopped and am still experiencing dryness.
23	1178	Then I started spotting very mild August 2nd, it is now August 19th and the bleeding is becoming heavier.
23	1179	My Sex drive didn't change at all but this spotting makes things a little more difficult.
23	1180	I have a period once every 2 months, it lasts 6-7 days but it's very light (spotting) not even enough to wear a tampon I just use a pantie liner and I'm good to go.
23	1181	So far, I have experienced some dizziness, lightheaded, very random nausea, random/light spotting, headaches, a little weight gain and heartburn (but both are because I have been eating crappy) Headaches are becoming more frequent now but Tylenol helps.
23	1182	Since then, just super light off and on spotting (not even enough for a panty liner though).
23	1183	It was never just spotting either; sometimes the bleeding would get so bad it would be like a period.
23	1184	I just started spotting yesterday, and it's been very light.
23	1185	I had my arm implant on May 07 20015 a month after given birth.The first year in a half it was all good no bleeding or spotting no periods ,but then in Nov of 2016 I started spotting  and it was on and off for weeks.
23	1186	I have been spotting constantly on and off again since last month.
23	1187	No spotting or anything.
23	1188	At one point I had light spotting everyday for a month.
23	1189	Just a little bit of spotting at the beginning.
23	1190	The nexplanon side effects caused constant spotting, made me so moody, and caused breakouts all over my face.
23	1191	I have had only spotting once or twice in three years.
23	1192	I don't have spotting in between periods, and my periods are pretty much the same as they always have been.
23	1193	But it was just light spotting.
23	1194	I've had spotting that lasted about 13 days but it beats taking a pill everyday!
23	1195	I got my Nexplanon implant sometime in early January and began spotting days later.
23	1196	I haven't had any spotting in between periods.
23	1197	I had it in for about a year and experienced heavy spotting in between periods as well as severe fatigue and body aches right before every cycle.
23	1198	I started light spotting and it stopped.
23	1199	I had practically no period except maybe a little spotting every other month or so that lasted like 24 hours.
23	1200	It's been a few weeks since I've had any spotting and I really hope I don't spot again for the next 3 years.
23	1201	I went maybe 3 months without a cycle but now I've been spotting for almost 2 weeks, can't handle that either.
23	1202	It ranges from the flow of my typical period to light spotting.
23	1203	I am spotting but not that bad.
23	1204	The second month I received slight spotting during my time of month, but this month there was nothing!
23	1205	But I'm now on month 5 and I started spotting again.
23	1206	So In March I got the implant and I am not even exaggerating I've been on my period ever since, all the time like legit all day everyday I'm spotting some days its super light other days its like Im having my period I'm giving this till the end of the month.
23	1207	First of I am four months in and I have not stopped spotting.
23	1208	My periods would come twice a month but it was light spotting and only lasted about 4 days.
23	1209	The first few months were a little annoying due to the spotting.
23	1210	The first year was the worst with light spotting almost every day of the year.
23	1211	This year the spotting has come back and is more than normal I've been bleeding for 3 weeks straight wondering when it'll stop.
23	1212	I never had a period on Depo, ever since the Depo has been out of my system I have been spotting almost 24/7!!
23	1213	It is super annoying, but it's not a huge nuisance since the spotting is so light and minimal.
23	1214	Constant spotting for 3 years.
23	1215	Hoping for no spotting or periods.
23	1216	The side effects were also horrible, I would NOT stop spotting, I bled everyday and it is just gross.
23	1217	For a month or two I continued to get my period but it was only light spotting.
23	1218	My period was nonexsistant, then it would last for up to 8 days, then it would be basically nothing, but I still had to wear a pad for some spotting.
23	1219	I had the implant inserted October 2016, but at age 45 I'm not fond of the 2 week cycle/spotting, 1 week of nothing and back on to spotting.
23	1220	Everyday I have spotting and it's gotten to the point where I have to wear a tampon every day .
23	1221	hi, I got the nexplanon April 2016, it was great, I bled about 3 weeks straight, then some spotting, then nothing for almost a whole year when I bled for a week.
23	1222	For most of the first year I had no periods but spotting for months.
23	1223	For the last 7bor so months I haven't had a period or spotting.
23	1224	That I wouldn't stop spotting.
23	1225	I do notice spotting  sometimes for a day but it honestly  usually coincides with when I'm stressed.
23	1226	I would have 3 day periods, then spotting, then back on heavy for a day then back off for a week then started all over again.
23	1227	By the time the bleeding & brown spotting stop it's time for another cycle.
23	1228	And after my 3 year mark I had my period for a full MONTH, with very few spotting days in between.
23	1229	I got it put in about 2 months ago and have had no spotting, weight gain, or loss of sex drive.
23	1230	Now I am constantly spotting.
23	1231	Then things settled down and I would just get my period as normal with spotting after intercourse, which was annoying but manageable.
23	1232	I do have spotting on it, but nothing that the pill doesn't fix.
23	1233	I've experienced spotting ever since having it fitted so was put on the mini pill as well to control it (worst idea ever, too many hormones!!!)
23	1234	I've been bleeding heavily for about a month straight and I've been spotting since the first week I got it !
23	1235	The only negative effect for me was spotting that lasted about a month but has lightened up now.
23	1236	I've talked to my doctor who had that spotting for the first six months, which was good to know.
23	1237	At the time, my cycle had just ended so I wasn't sure if I would experience spotting or not.
23	1238	It's been almost five days since my period ended and I've had very minimal spotting.
23	1239	I will only bleed every 3-6 months, but it's only spotting.
23	1240	And this spotting lasts for about a month straight.
23	1241	I do get bad headaches sometimes, but my period weirdly came on time but it was just really light spotting.
23	1242	I started out just spotting.
23	1243	The spotting has lightened up and I feel normal again.
23	1244	I got the implant in Jan 2017 my period came left for a few days and then I started spotting (I guess that's what u would call it) for a whole month.
23	1245	I got it removed in March 2017 and I still have not stopped  this spotting.
23	1246	And it's back spotting.
23	1247	It's now  been 2.5 weeks since I got it removed and the spotting has yet to stop.
23	1248	If I wasn't experiencing the anxiety I would give it a rating of 10 as my periods are only a bit of light spotting and I have no pain but the panic attacks are a no go for me!
23	1249	My periods are irregular I get a period every 2-3 months and it's always on the regular to lighter side but it always lasts 7 days or more like a constant spotting almost.
23	1250	Within 3 weeks I had some spotting that lasted for two weeks but nothing since.
23	1251	However, I believe that because I had already been skipping my placebo pills, Nexplanon didn't cause any spotting of any kind.
23	1252	I had a 9 day period a month after getting the implant in and had spotting for about 4 days a few months after that.
23	1253	Since then, I haven't had any type of period or spotting and it is very convenient.
23	1254	I have about one, rarely two, days of very light spotting approximately once every three to four months.
23	1255	First time irregular spotting or bleeding per say for a good month after that I never had a period again.
23	1256	Now it's been a few years off of it I'm back on it first month no period and now it's been a week of light spotting dark to light back n forth.
23	1257	My doctor put me on birth control pills for the first three months because my period would not stop and I was regularly spotting.
23	1258	It took close to a year before the spotting officially stopped, but it's never been super inconvenient and isn't frequent.
23	1259	Only positive thing what that I haven't had my period at all and no spotting either.
23	1260	I do very rarely get some light spotting, but I haven't bought pads or tampons in months.
23	1261	Then I'd go a month without any spotting, then a month of straight spotting.
23	1262	After I got it, I had a couple of months of really odd periods-- it started with random day (or even couple-of-hour) long spotting or really light flow in no sort of cycle, then became very heavy long-lasting periods every fortnight or so.
23	1263	At first my periods were irregular and had spotting in between, had lower back pain and mood swings/depression.
23	1264	I been on it for almost two years I haven't gotten a period since I've been on it but now I'm getting a lot spotting for the past few weeks.
23	1265	I've had Nexplanon about 6 months now and have had light spotting once and am glad to still not have a period.
23	1266	I didn't have another period until January, and it lasted longer than normal and I have had spotting since then but nothing bad and it is not accompanied by any normal PMS symptoms so it's pretty much wearing a liner everyday just in case.
23	1267	When I first got it placed I had little spotting here and there, I stopped getting a regular period.
23	1268	Had my first period in a few months a few weeks ago and some spotting recently.
23	1269	I haven't gotten any periods (which is awesome) although as of lately, I have been spotting a little bit.
23	1270	My period has completely stop , I only experience a little spotting sometimes.
23	1271	With nexplanon, I had light spotting for 3 days and haven't had a period since.
23	1272	I had to have my implant taken out I had it put in 2 years ago and since then I have gained 40LBs that I haven't been able to get rid of like I used to and have been agitated and moody no one tells you the first 6-8 months you can't even have sex because you're constantly bleeding and spotting.
23	1273	I have some spotting and noticeably lighter periods (also less often).
23	1274	I had a little bit a spotting from time to time for first few months and no I never have a period which I love.
23	1275	I had a bruise for about two weeks on the insertion site, but have only had 2-3 days of spotting since then, have lost weight from going off the pill, and haven't had any UTI's since insertion (I got them once every 2-3 months before the implant).
23	1276	Co worker of mine swore by it, the only thing she warned me about was slight spotting for the first month.
23	1277	Not harmless spotting either, some days a light tampon or pad, and other days it was much heavier.
23	1278	Not even kidding this birth control is the worst and this isn't just spotting it's heavy bleeding, I'm never happy anymore either I've had it for about five months and I'm getting it taken out to put and IUD in I can't even believe they market this as a valid birth control what woman would want such an irregular period
23	1279	Also when my period comes on it lastest about 2 weeks but mainly just spotting.
23	1280	I do observe brown colored spotting during my period time but nothing other that.
23	1281	But now I have had spotting for about 3 weeks and it is just annoying.
23	1282	I just want the spotting to stop!
23	1283	A friend told me she had experienced the same thing but her spotting only lasted two weeks - hoping it stops soon.
23	1284	The next week I'm spotting and before you know it I'm bleeding, spotting, bleeding, spotting.
23	1285	I had no periods only minor spotting.
23	1286	Then this month I started spotting (about 12 days ago) and it hasn't stopped yet.
23	1287	My period has been off, lots of spotting, but it's really nothing that isn't manageable.
23	1288	The first of December I started spotting old blood/brown blood for 7 days then my regular period came I was happy then it last for 7 days straight ok I can handle that.
23	1289	After 5 months I started noticing spotting more.
23	1290	I've had explanan for 3 months now at first I was scared to get it because I read all the bad reviews about it and especially of gaining weight which I already struggle with however I decided that I didn't want to risk getting pregnant so I got the nexplanon I had no side effects till I got my period which usually last 2-3 days however nexplanon changed it to 2 weeks and some spotting a few days after intercourse other than that no other horrible side effects I don't regret my decision and no more worrys of getting pregnant I love it !
23	1291	There are 1-3 days were there might not be any bleeding but then it is followed by weeks of constant spotting.
23	1292	Had Nexplanon twice over the last 5 year never had periods during that time only had blood spotting since I had my new one put in, but over the last 5 years felt really depressed and overly sensitive about thing which I feel is making me a bit paranoid.
23	1293	Then they slowly taper off, to leave me with spotting for 2 weeks.
23	1294	I rarely ever experienced spotting, maybe 2 or 3 times this whole time.
23	1295	I'm 35 and never felt more like a teenager because of horrible spotting, break outs and no sex.
23	1296	No spotting.
23	1297	I also had bleeding and spotting for 2 and a half months until my doctor gave a birth control pill to control the bleeding, so now I'm just getting a double dose of hormone.
23	1298	My vagina was a Sahara spotting every second day.
23	1299	I got the nexplanon inserted around the early part of July 2016 two weeks after the insertion I started spotting then came my period here it is almost December and I have been on my period since then I've gained ALOT of weight which I'm very unhappy about I really didn't have no side effects besides the weight gain and periods (and no sex
23	1300	Since then she has been sick several times, lost interest in a lot of things she once enjoyed, has continued to have light spotting since the implantation.
23	1301	She has had spotting the entire 3mths since implanted.
23	1302	Not spotting.
23	1303	I have headaches regularly and have pregnancy symptoms all the time, such as sore breasts, spotting, bloating, and nausea.
23	1304	Now it's November 4th, 2016 and my bleeding has become heavy after spotting for about 2 days.
23	1305	But I haven't had a 'real' period but Sept & Oct I have been spotting for at least 2 1/2 weeks.
23	1306	Or maybe I shouldn't complain and just get used to spotting every day for the rest of my life :|
23	1307	He is now eighteen months old and I have been having a "period" that is weird heavy or at least spotting for a month and a half now.
23	1308	First 6 I was either spotting or on my period.
23	1309	After I was done with the trail pack I immediately went back to spotting.
23	1310	Some days it is light spotting, other days it is super heavy, but there is always something.
23	1311	First few months were great, no periods, small spotting to nothing at all.
23	1312	Only occasional spotting and eventually no period at all.
23	1313	My periods were very irregular never heavy,  just spotting for a very long times (sometimes two weeks)  and would leave for a couple days and come right back.
23	1314	I've enjoyed not having a period or super light spotting.
23	1315	I had mild spotting a week after it was put in and no period since, however, I did get a real heavy period that was nothing but brown blood (old blood) but no big deal.
23	1316	I have had a pd (super light dark spotting) once and it lasted 3 weeks, but since had no other spotting.
23	1317	By month 3 I was spotting every few days, it started out light for a couple days for a few months but then it became heavy and lasted atleast 5 days.
23	1318	I went to my doctor to get a high dose of ibuprofen and that made me stop spotting for 2 weeks & then BLEEDING again.
23	1319	The doctor said that the spotting would go away by the 6th month & I tried to stick it out & that was a HUGE mistake.
23	1320	A little spotting in the beginning, but nothing major.
23	1321	I menstruate at least three times a month, full cycles not "spotting."
23	1322	I just had it removed because I've been spotting every day since it was placed in, in January 2016, it is now October 2016 and I began to form a constant period odor that was not pleasant for me or my boyfriend.
23	1323	During the first couple months my period was very light & short, however now I have my period about twice a month for about 8 days each cycle, sometimes with spotting in between (sometimes a full month of bleeding).
23	1324	After bleeding three weeks straight I was period free for a week then had more spotting for close to two weeks.
23	1325	Then I was free for about 6 days then here I am spotting again.
23	1326	At least on the nuva ring, it did what it said without even any spotting.
23	1327	The whole time I never really had a period, light spotting here and there.
23	1328	It stopped after a week and now I'm just lightly spotting.
23	1329	Haha :) yeah, I've had some spotting here and there but nothing that has really effected me.
23	1330	The first month I had it in I was supposed to start my period but I didn't start it til two weeks later it lasted about a week then spotting for a few days after that; since then I have not had a period.
23	1331	Sometimes I'm light or spotting and then randomly I'll get heavy.
23	1332	I have literally bled constantly (either on my period or heavy spotting) every single day for 8 months.
23	1333	When I was on it, I was moody, depressed, spotting for three months, not to mention gained the weight I lost while being off of it.
23	1334	Weeks 2-4 I I had some spotting that has gone completely.
23	1335	I have had no mood swings, weight gain, or bad spotting.
23	1336	I just noticed spotting for the first time after a year and 6 months.
23	1337	The spotting after a year startled me but I assume it's normal after doing some research.
23	1338	I've had this for about 2 months now and aside from spotting I love it, I'm actually losing weight, my mood swings and depression is actually becoming better.
23	1339	The only side effects that I'm experiancing is the spotting, and I'm always tired but I rather take that them worrying constantly about being pregnant or checking for strings or taking a pill everyday.
23	1340	I know the spotting with subside after my body becomes more accustomed to this
23	1341	As a birth control it does the job, no pregnancies/scares, however if you're an emotional person or get agitated with spotting I would not recommend it.
23	1342	Irregular bleedimg and spotting.
23	1343	Then no bleeding for about 8 weeks and 2 days after my gastric bypass surgery I started spotting and then it went from heavy to light flow different every day.
23	1344	Now I haven't stopped, constantly spotting.
23	1345	5 weeks into the implant I started my period again and this time it wasn't going away my period last 4 months and first 2 weeks were heavy bleeding and then the next few months were light bleeding and spotting.
23	1346	This affected my sex life as I didn't want to have sex on my period or even when I had spotting.
23	1347	Now about 1 year and 4 months into the implant I still get prolonged bleeding bleed for 2 months  & spotting 1 month.
23	1348	I've had spotting on and off since the third week of having it in, I usually have very heavy periods, but since I've had it in I feel they got rather light.
23	1349	Aside from the random spotting I don't mind it.
23	1350	I did have light spotting here and there.
23	1351	No spotting or any bad side effects.
23	1352	Then after about a month, I started spotting constantly.
23	1353	Bloating, but no spotting.
23	1354	I do get very light spotting from time to time.
23	1355	It wasn't even a period more like spotting on and off 'll day and today just brown discharge.
23	1356	I've had constant spotting, one of my periods lasted for just over 3 weeks.
23	1357	My period started on time the next month but I did not stop bleeding, it just dwindled down to a light spotting.
23	1358	I'd give this birth control a 10 on effectiveness because the amount of time I spend bleeding or spotting means there's no time to even attempt to be intimate, therefore no time to get pregnant.
23	1359	My periods have gone away completely I have no more spotting.
23	1360	I have been spotting this entire time, and I still get my very heavy monthly.
23	1361	I haven't gotten a period since it was implanted but occasionally have brown blood spotting but that is occurring less and less I've noticed.
23	1362	Not even spotting, full blown on my period.
23	1363	The first year/year and a half I would have a period which was mostly only spotting once every three months just for a couple of days which was really nice and then I just stopped getting a period at all I haven't had one in months which is amazing.
23	1364	I haven't had a period the since I've been on it, only occasional spotting after the first year.
23	1365	There's a day here a there where I don't bleed or it's light spotting, but otherwise I've had a very literal period for almost eight months.
23	1366	The only change I've noticed since the first week I had it include light spotting (happened 4 days ever out of 18 months).
23	1367	My insurance covered nearly all of the expense, and the spotting is quite a fair trade for no more painful PMS or ultra heavy periods, and no unwanted pregnancies.
23	1368	After that I would have a period every month, but that also involved a lot of spotting.
23	1369	I've had this for almost 4 years now and I love it does its job I had my period for a couple months the first time I got it and didn't have once for 6 months to a year had spotting very rarely so I'm not complaining except I was bleed Brown blood alot for weeks which really sucks and not to mention the mood swings I have but nothing I couldn't handle.Best birth control I ever had.
23	1370	Had nexplanon inserted may 31st had a period 7 days later after finishing my pill ever since then I've had no spotting or bleeding at all.
23	1371	I got the nexplanon inserted march 1st 2016 and i have made an appointment for it to be removed....the only good thing from it is only spotting for a few days a month and it does its job to prevent pregnancy but i can pretty much cry on command now...i get mad over the tiniest things that wouldn't have mattered before i got this...and also ive gained atleast 20 pounds without a single change in my diet..definitely wouldn't recommend!
23	1372	The last year of my BC came with very irregular spotting and occasional periods.
23	1373	The only positive thing about it was my periods were reduced to a few days of spotting.
23	1374	I got the nexplanon two weeks after I have my baby March 26th 2016 I had minor spotting bad next month but that was it I haven't had any periods are spotting since then but I did notice I get headaches more frequently sometimes I get a nauseated feeling dizzy I was getting dizzy a lot but besides that so far so good
23	1375	But I'm getting more than regular periods, and between those, constant spotting.
23	1376	And from their I've had light spotting a few days out of the month and now I have no period due to nexplanon.
23	1377	Sometimes it's just spotting, but the majority of the time I feel like it's a full on cycle.
23	1378	I had random spotting a couple times and then it stopped at the end of May.
23	1379	I did have stomach pain every single time I ate for 2 weeks around the time the bleeding and spotting stopped so I think that was just my body finally regulating itself.
23	1380	Now I have been spotting for 8 days with some clots which my not seem like a big deal but it super strange for me.
23	1381	The day I got it I had my period for two weeks straight and was spotting pretty frequently after that.
23	1382	I finally stopped spotting hopefully, but other than the mood swings I can't really complain.
23	1383	Around the end of February my period stopped completely with a little spotting here and there!
23	1384	After 2mths of regular periods I spotted until August 2015 (8mths) The spotting was very light.
23	1385	Since mid August 2015 (11mth)I have not had a period or spotting.
23	1386	If I even get a period I spot for a few days like I'm currently doing but sometimes it's heavier for a few days then some spotting.
23	1387	January-May it was light spotting (10-15 days).
23	1388	This entire month of June I have been spotting.
23	1389	I've only had a two week period without bleeding or spotting.
23	1390	To me the spotting is substantial enough where I'm uncomfortable to have sex with my fiancé and mind you our second baby is 4 months old so we can count how many times we have had sex.
23	1391	Going into my tenth month however I've noticed some spotting and have been experiencing breast pain mostly my nipples have felt sore and sensitive.
23	1392	I haven't had a period since just a lot of spotting at random.
23	1393	Acne, heavy periods (10-13 days), spotting.
23	1394	The bleeding was crazy for the last 6 months.I use to have a lot of spotting but that stop after the 5th or 4th month.Before using nexplanon my period was 3 days long but from 1st to the 6th months in it became 2 weeks long.Now that i'm 7th months in it has became a week long.I have high tolerance so I don't let most of these side effects bother me so that is probably why I haven't taken the nexplanon out.I'm scared to try an other birthcontrol methods.
23	1395	The spotting is super light AND I haven't had a heavy period since I've had it inserted.
23	1396	I have anxiety and have gone through depression as well but this birth control hasn't made it worse or caused me to go back into depression but I do pms often since I am spotting so often.
23	1397	The spotting has not affected my sex life..
23	1398	I recommend this if you aren't too affected by spotting or pmsing.
23	1399	I've had the implant since March, had a 2 week long period in April, no period in May and a 2 week long period in June followed by constant spotting of either blood or brown discharge.
23	1400	I was off my period for about 2 weeks and had spotting during that, but after the 2 weeks I got my period and I had it for I don't even know how long but months straight!
23	1401	I get light spotting for 3-4 days each month.
23	1402	I also started spotting a week after I put it in and it did not stop until a week after I removed it.
23	1403	Almost 2 years in, I am having my first spotting session, its very light and I believe it will pass.
23	1404	After 3 months of having it it was great I didn't hardly bleed just little spotting nothing serious didn't have all that headaches & everything else people had.
23	1405	It's not a full period, but it's not spotting either.
23	1406	No other side effects other than minor spotting and no more period.
23	1407	After that month of bleeding and spotting, I haven't had a period since.
23	1408	3 weeks later the spotting began and it hasn't stopped.
23	1409	I should have been more questioning when the nurse asked me if I was comfortable carrying panty liners everywhere in case I start spotting randomly.
23	1410	Thankfully the only side effects Ive experienced are weight gain, 13lbs which was welcomed since I was a little under-weight and light spotting every now and then, nothing too bothersome.
23	1411	Literally in the beginning I had heaving bleeding and atfew times spotting for 4 months straight!!!
23	1412	Unfortunately 3 mths ago I started bleeidn and spotting every other week rather than one month.
23	1413	My period stopped and the first month after I got random spotting.
23	1414	No period and no spotting!
23	1415	Mostly spotting, but it's all been about black.
23	1416	I started spotting after 6 weeks.
23	1417	It has suddenly stopped working as effectively as before and I am spotting every other day.
23	1418	On Nexplanon I have been spotting for nearly the entire past month and I'm always tired and have been having depression issues.
23	1419	At first, the side effects were minimal, but by the third month I was getting periods that lasted 10  days and was spotting the rest of the month.
23	1420	At first it was light spotting and now it's just gotten worse and worse to where I am ALWAYS bleeding.
23	1421	Love the birth control other than I've been spotting for a month I'm so sick of it!
23	1422	When I first had it inserted, I had light spotting for about three weeks.
23	1423	I don't get my period or any spotting now-the last time I got my period was March 2014.
23	1424	Like many others, I experienced a lot bleeding and spotting.
23	1425	Then after about a year, my period went to about 7-9 straight days a month, every month, with sporatic spotting to bleeding in between.
23	1426	I have not had any spotting or bleeding since.
23	1427	At the start of the second month though the spotting began.
23	1428	3 day spotting every 3 months.
23	1429	It's been really frustrating for me because even though my boyfriend is very supportive, understanding, and doesn't mind having sex while I'm spotting, it still makes me feel selfconscoius.
23	1430	Idk if this is accurate or not, but the next day I started spotting & I think sex triggered my period.
23	1431	I either experienced spotting or no period at all.
23	1432	The spotting stops after the first few months and the last few months I've been spotting/period free all together.
23	1433	I do have to say that im constantly spotting and on my period which is a minus and im hoping i will soon stop having two periods a month but overall i like it.
23	1434	I've been spotting for an entire month, and it looks like it's not stopping anytime soon.
23	1435	I called the doctor 2 weeks into the spotting, and they told me if it continued to call them the next week.
23	1436	I have had no spotting and no period since and no side effects that I can say are definitely from nexplanon.
23	1437	When I first got it, I was spotting a lot and then my period was abnormal.
23	1438	The first week after insertion I had spotting but since that first week I haven't had a period which is great.
23	1439	The procedure was quick and painless, lasted about 2 mins and I was done, it's not at all noticable in the arm it's placed and as far as side effects I've experinced the light spotting that started a week ago to date but it only requires a thin panty liner.
23	1440	Once the spotting finally goes I'll be able to say it's great (hate the spotting) but rather spot than be pregnant and not having to remember to take a pill or suffer weight gain is a plus with Nexplanon, I've actually lost weight while on it so all in all I'm loving this contraceptive choice.
23	1441	I got it during my period, and my period finished out, then I had extremely light spotting for about a month and a half.
23	1442	After those first 3 months, my mood went back to normal but I started spotting really lightly for 2 months.
23	1443	It wasn't enough spotting for a tampon but it was enough for a panty liner if that puts in into perspective for you.
23	1444	I've had no unexpected bleeding or spotting.
23	1445	After that the next two months I had only spotting but no periods.
23	1446	I been on nexplanon for 2 years now an i can actually say I haven't gotten pregnant and I haven't use a condom with my boyfriend for 2 years now only then I hate about it is my periods it's last up to 2 weeks but It isn't that bad because I be extremely light or more like spotting I haven't have any depression not really any Anxiety attack my skin has not really break out or I haven't gain or lost weight over nexplanon but ever body is different
23	1447	Usually I go at least half a year without experiencing the spotting other users have described (it's been minimal).
23	1448	I get spotting maybe every three months for a day or two.
23	1449	I had light spotting for a few weeks which was expected according to my doctor.
23	1450	I bled the first month, I had spotting throughout.
23	1451	My cycle is still the same while lasting a few days more via spotting.
23	1452	No spotting, I've had one period that only lasted about 9 days, and a little bit of joint pain.
23	1453	I was really planning on getting it out once the 3 month trial period was up, but now it's the end of March and I haven't had a period, spotting, or any side effects since then.
23	1454	2 weeks later, I started to get spotting.
23	1455	It's been 6 days now, and the spotting is enough for a liner.
23	1456	If this is what the next 3 years are gonna be like (small breaks between periods or constant spotting), then I'm getting this thing out.
23	1457	I had no periods whatsoever for over a year, no side effects at all and no spotting.
23	1458	I had finished my regular period, and have had very light spotting since then.
23	1459	Other than the spotting, though, I haven't had any side effects other than the bleeding, so I hope I'm one of the lucky ones.
23	1460	Although I have been spotting almost everyday for a little over a month it's never enough to leave anything in my panties,i only notice when I wipe.
23	1461	About a week and a half after getting the implant, I started spotting and didn't stop for two and a half months, which was pretty discouraging at first, however it was very light and I knew my body could take time to adjust to the new hormone so I waited it out.
23	1462	Side note: I highly suggest U by Kotex panty liners, they don't feel like they're even there (not sponsored, wish I was ;) ) When I stopped spotting, no period for around 50 days.
23	1463	after that i had no period and spotting occured a few times a year.
23	1464	I'm back to the same problem with spotting.
23	1465	I have not had a period in over 2 months, no abnormal bleeding or spotting.
23	1466	I have occasional spotting but it is very, very light.
23	1467	No adverse reactions outside of spotting for the first three months with the first one and I've had no issues with implant/extraction procedures.
23	1468	heavier than spotting.
23	1469	Then in early January I started spotting and it has not stopped it's not heavy but it's been constant if the purpose is abstinence then it's doing its job because there's no having sex if you're bleeding constantly.
23	1470	I've had the implant since May 2015 and a month after I gave birth to my 4th baby, and bled for 2 months straight with spotting for the 3rd month, I've gained 40lbs.
23	1471	I had a little spotting in between periods for two or three.
23	1472	I have experienced no spotting, no bleeding, no pain associated with my cycle and have found my moodiness to have curbed.
23	1473	The first 4 months were great, I had no period or spotting none whatsoever.
23	1474	At first the bruise lasts awhile and I had spotting for 8 months after insertion which was fine except it made sex a lot messier.
23	1475	I was on my period for about 5 months including the heavy spotting.
23	1476	I had spotting constantly since implantation but I was told that was normal and would go away.
23	1477	In now in three pills, two creams and am miserable, still spotting, and hate this birth control.
23	1478	The problem I'm facing now is I have been spotting for about a month now and it hasn't been red-it's been a brown, rust color (sorry to go into details, but maybe I'm not the only one).
23	1479	I was spotting for the first few days.
23	1480	I recently got the Nexplanon last month and its ok, I've been spotting for the last 2 weeks & now I have severe stomach pains.....I'm still going to give it a shot at east six month, It has caused me to not have an appetite at all not sure if that's normal but since I'm only one month in I'll still consider this for of birth control.
23	1481	I had a little spotting for 2 weeks post insert and then nothing at all for 4 months.
23	1482	Usually my periods would last seven to eight days but my first period after getting the implant lasted 12 days and this past one lasted 10 and then I started spotting last night.
23	1483	No spotting, no side effects.
23	1484	I'm still having spotting right now after a month of on-and-off bleeding/spotting.
23	1485	It wasn't bad, I had no spotting.
23	1486	I didn't get my period again no spotting no bleeding for over a year..
23	1487	I had very light spotting for 2 weeks after it was put in.
23	1488	Seemed like a lot, but now that I have no sign of a period, or even spotting for almost 2 weeks now.
23	1489	it varies in how heavy the spotting was but it was never heavy, but enough to constantly have to wear a liner.
23	1490	since then, I've had spotting that lasts roughly 2 weeks every 2 months!
23	1491	I went 10 months with no spotting or bleeding.
23	1492	I have constant spotting.
23	1493	I started taking the 3 month deposit shots last year and got the nexplan on in December... no bleeding, no spotting, no periods!
23	1494	Over the  past 2 months, I have been spotting 3/4 of the time  and  have no sex drive  at all.
23	1495	I had spotting for about 3 months, complete loss of sex drive, insane irritability and mood swings, and gained 30 pounds.
23	1496	After having it for a week I experienced spotting for about a month.
23	1497	Since then, I've been spotting every single day with only one week without spotting.
23	1498	I went back to my doctor on Dec 24th and she prescribed me the mini pill to help with the spotting.
23	1499	I have been on Nexplanon for about a year and a half now and I HATE it I've been to my ob/gyn a couple of & she convinced me to try it for a few more months I have had heavy periods and spotting along with blood clots since I received the Nexplanon.
23	1500	Now that I've had it for over a year and a half, I never get a period, just occasional spotting every 3 or 4 months.
23	1501	About a week after the insertion, I began spotting.
23	1502	I tried taking iburprofen (200 mg/6x day) for a week, which helped, but then the spotting came back.
23	1503	Last week however, I had a week long period of no spotting.
23	1504	Will probably try for another month to see if the spotting stops
23	1505	This bleeding is not like typical bleeding for me but just heavy spotting.
23	1506	During the first couple of months it was okay no spotting or anything, then out of no where I had gotten a period that lasted for 3 weeks straight.
23	1507	I do have VERY light spotting maybe twice a month and that's it.
23	1508	Since before being on this BC I hadn't had a period so I thought I would at least have some sort of period or spotting but I haven't!
23	1509	Didn't bleed again until mid Oct and that was only spotting over 2 days.
23	1510	So far no period, small spotting, no weight gain, no emotional changes, or any other concerns.
23	1511	I began to spot between cycles and the longer I stayed on it, the more the spotting progressed until I was getting a period about every other week.
23	1512	My first month was straight bleeding and since then I am almost constantly spotting.
23	1513	Just a little light light spotting.
23	1514	mind you I have been on this product for almost 7 and a half months, I just thought that all the spotting was supposed to happen.
23	1515	When I tell you (minus the first 2 weeks) I have been spotting ever since I got it put in; I have LITERALLY been spotting ever since I got it in.
23	1516	The light spotting lasted for about 3 weeks.
23	1517	I have always had a problem with the spotting.
23	1518	I had two light periods at my regular times and some spotting when I first started but I haven't had a period since then.
23	1519	Three weeks after , I began spotting .
23	1520	Now that I'm onto my second year I have a lot of random spotting, I've lost my sex drive, and I gained a lot of weight.
23	1521	I knew going into getting it that there would be "spotting" but I didn't expect to have a heavy period for 2   weeks.
23	1522	Would bleed for a week, stop for 1 day or 2, then start again and it's been like this since, very dark blood but very light but it's more than spotting.
23	1523	I've had NO periods and NO spotting.
23	1524	when I first got nexaplanon inserted I was greeted with spotting and random periods..
23	1525	There is really no telling and I have to be prepared for spotting as it can happen any time for me.
23	1526	But unusual spotting.
23	1527	Continuous spotting for 6 months.
23	1528	My periods are non existent besides spotting, which is different for everyone on this medication.
23	1529	The first year I had no period and almost no spotting.
23	1530	The 2nd year I started spotting every 2 months or so but it was very light and only lasted a day or two.
23	1531	I had seen everywhere that spotting was the worst symptom of this.
23	1532	Once I got the nexplanon my period stopped immediately with no spotting whatsoever!
23	1533	I have experienced spotting through out the whole time.
23	1534	My periods, if they come at all, are just a couple days of light spotting.
23	1535	Oh & after sex, like the day after I'll have heavier spotting.
23	1536	I recommend this to anyone who doesn't want a period, but doesn't mind spotting the majority of the time.
23	1537	After a while I started noticing brown spotting in my underwear.
23	1538	I've had the implant for 2 years now, and my complaint list is minimal, yes it prevents pregnancy but the irregular periods and spotting are very annoying because you never know when it's going to happen, it's always a suprise and very inconvenient.
23	1539	But if you can look past the spotting and irregular periods that come and go as they please, this is the BC for you.
23	1540	I have not experienced any spotting or mood swings.
23	1541	Nexplanon would be awesome if I didn't have constant spotting.
23	1542	I was spotting unexpectedly but I didn't really find that a huge issue.
23	1543	I've gained 40 lbs, and my skin was perfectly clear until the 6 months of constant spotting were over.
23	1544	Now with this one, I have been experiencing light spotting for 3 weeks on and off.
23	1545	I loved it the first month; no side effects light spotting a couple days.
23	1546	It stopped for a little bit, still some light spotting.
23	1547	I wouldn't be so terrible if it was light spotting but it was heavy the entire time.
23	1548	I gained 15 pounds, didn't have periods just spotting, and tmi but I needed lubricant during sex which before I had no issue with hm I also was always irritable and crazy emotional and I always had weird cravings was always hungry or tired
23	1549	Some times I get some spotting and its usually old blood but only for maybe 2 days.
23	1550	I have had the implant for 10 months now and at first I had the typical occasional spotting which wasn't a big deal but then in a 3 month span I had 7 full blown periods.
23	1551	I've been spotting and heavily bleeding for so long.
23	1552	I didn't notice any spotting until a couple weeks after I got it put in but I haven't stopped spotting and it SUCKS.
23	1553	After time it slowly started getting better I think it took about a year for my body to adjust to it now I hardly have a period at all maybe one every other month and at the most it's either super lite or just spotting.
23	1554	No painful periods, just spotting every 2 or 3 months.
23	1555	At first I had no periods for months then I had a few months of lots of spotting but now I'm fairly regular (light period every month).
23	1556	I got nexplanon July 8th of this year it has been a living hell I been bleeding continuously off and on spotting.
23	1557	Got it in April 2015 and now October 2015 I'm barely spotting only...not liking it since it's making my head break out and giving me cyst...thinking about taking it out soon!
23	1558	I have had nexplanon for 4 months already, and have only had spotting since insertion.
23	1559	I would consider a downside being the spotting lasted two to three weeks around the second-third month, but overall it's been nice not having a period.
23	1560	I haven't experienced any heavy bleeding however I do have a lot of spotting and it's random.
23	1561	My period has virutally disappeared with the exception of occasional spotting (every 3-4 months) for a few days and it is very light spotting.
23	1562	Now, October 2015, I have not have any spotting or bleeding a since April (AT LEAST) and all of the sudden I start bleeding today.
23	1563	When I first got it I had a little bit of spotting, but after a while it went away and now I don't get anything at all.
23	1564	I've always had irregular periods before the implant, and I just began spotting today, a month after insertion.
23	1565	My periods went from 4 days long to 2 weeks long with random spotting in between, I've gained 20 pounds in 4 months, I have constant breakouts, and the mood swings are unbelievable.
23	1566	For 2 months I had non stop spotting!
23	1567	Too embarrassed to have sex cause of the spotting.
23	1568	The first month I experienced mood swings, depression, hair loss and, migraines by the third month I still experienced all side effects except the spotting stopped.
23	1569	I've had the nexplanon in for almost a month and have heavy to light spotting every day since insertion.
23	1570	No periods and still no periods, except DARK black spotting.
23	1571	The frustrating thing about it was that it wasn't even enough for a full tampon; I was spotting for weeks.
23	1572	Since having it inserted in July '14 my periods have definitely varied from non-existent to spotting to a full-blown period.
23	1573	Well 2 weeks after I received it, I started spotting nonstop for the next month.
23	1574	I then stopped for 2 weeks again but then I started spotting again and have not stopped since.
23	1575	Until about November then I had it once in November, Once at the very end of December, and I have not had a period, not even spotting since the January 3, 2015.
23	1576	This is my second go around with this birth control the first 3 years I had NO period or spotting the entire 3 years.
23	1577	I don't get periods but I do get spotting.
23	1578	I've had maybe a week and a half collectively that I haven't had a period, other than that I've had a heavy period or heavy spotting for about 4 months.
23	1579	I had no periods (except for light spotting twice, both lasting less than 24 hours).
23	1580	Then a week later I had another and then a week after that I started spotting.
23	1581	I got it early November 2014, bled daily till December then was absolutely fine... No spotting or anything.
23	1582	I was very concerned when my gyno said that It could cause some spotting but very rare.
23	1583	I had my first period that lasted a week as well and then came back after a week it was gone but it was a minimal spotting, it lasted for another week.
23	1584	Last month I had it for a total of one day and this month I haven't had it at all (which is scary at first because I thought I was pregnant) but my obgyn told me I would havery irregular bleeding or spotting and then it would eventually stop and I think it did stop but I still get occasional spotting but it's not bad at all.
23	1585	After 3 months I haven't had a period and haven't really had any spotting.
23	1586	I have had the implant in since the beginning of July 2015, & I have had all of 3 days where I was not bleeding, & I don't mean spotting, I mean BLEEDING.
23	1587	Then all of a sudden two weeks ago I started spotting.
23	1588	Although the spotting does suck , its 100% effective.
23	1589	The only real side effect I've gotten was a really bad headache and the spotting.
23	1590	I have started spotting......since I am no longer sexually active I don't see the need to keep it.
23	1591	I have no complaints other than the constant spotting.
23	1592	If you can handle the initial spotting etc.
23	1593	It's now September 6 and I been bleeding since not all days are heavy most spotting.
23	1594	The implant is ok it's just this spotting everyday want to drive me crazy.
23	1595	But knowing I can't go a week with out at least spotting makes me more then depresed.
23	1596	After a few months the spotting slowed to a halt.
23	1597	I got the Nexplanon replacement in 2014 and after a year, I have only had one spotting occurrence.
23	1598	I had my period for probably a month and spotting a little for 2 weeks.
23	1599	I have not had a period or any spotting until today.
23	1600	I've literally had 2 periods however the spotting hasn't stopped yet.
23	1601	My doctor assured me that it would stop my period and spotting but its been nothing but hell....
23	1602	At the end of July I started spotting (which was normally when I would start a period before birth control).
23	1603	The first week or so was great, no spotting no worries.
23	1604	The next week I starting light spotting that varied- which I was told was expected and common.
23	1605	I was also told that after the first two months most of the symptoms would go away and the spotting would stop.
23	1606	So I first got the nexplanon in July of 2014, for the first 5 months I was fine, I didn't get my period and if I did it was random spotting (very light) but around January I noticed I was very emotional EVERYTHING made me cry.
23	1607	Or I would spot for 2-3 weeks have a week where I thought It was over and started spotting again.
23	1608	Within the year I had spotting twice that lasted about a week.
23	1609	But it was only really light spotting.
23	1610	I had spotting for the first 2 weeks, 1 period is July and haven't had another one yet.
23	1611	Does anyone know if the spotting ever stops or do I just push through it?
23	1612	Of those 7 months I have had a period for 6 months and I don't mean spotting.
23	1613	For some time I did have two months in which I had a period almost two weeks of spotting, it stopped and then i got it again a week later.
23	1614	If the light spotting would stop it would be my dream birth control.
23	1615	I have only had small spotting which is nice but my anxiety levels are up and I do not sleep well.
23	1616	I haven't had a period, or even any spotting.
23	1617	The first three weeks I had no issues but now I've been spotting everyday since.
23	1618	I know I was told I would be spotting for several months on and off but I can't remember a day where I haven't spotted.
23	1619	Ok now with the Nexplanon I noticed at first I had no spotting or period up to these past 2 weeks and sometimes I bleed lightly or just spot so I'm finding myself having to use tampons, something I was not used to.
23	1620	But when I first noticed some spotting about a month ago, my obgyn gave me some birth control pills and it stopped then, but here I am now worse and I really don't know what to do because the pills won't stop it now.
23	1621	I have gotten occasional spotting, but it's been extremely minimal (literally like a spot), and it's only been a total of three days out of nine months.
23	1622	This month August 2015, I have spotted once on the 4th of this month lasted for 5 days and now I am spotting again, 13th of this month.
23	1623	Unfortunately nexplanon didn't live up to my expectations at all I bleed for the first 4 months straight, heavy spotting type of bleeding, and it was miserable!!!
23	1624	Once I hit 3 months of none stop spotting and bad mood swings I decided that it was time to get it removed.
23	1625	I will have 3 days of light spotting and then 2 days of nothing, then a few more days of spotting, then nothing for a few weeks.
23	1626	Since insertion 6 months ago, I've gotten my period 3 times - but just very light spotting.
23	1627	The first two times the spotting lasted 10 days, this last time it lasted for only 2 or 3.
23	1628	It's not spotting either it's like a period that I am bleeding my doctor says give it a couple more months but I am tired of bleeding so much, so I think I am gonna have my doctor take it out and go on something else.
23	1629	And now its almost been a whole year since I got it done and I now have no signs of a period or spotting and discharge.
23	1630	This time around, I basically never get a period...some spotting every once in a while but nothing much.
23	1631	On the shot my periods had all but disappeared; I'd get very minimal spotting for a single day out of two months.
23	1632	My periods were nonexistent at first then spotting a lot, now I spot about everyday but not enough for a pad or tampon.
23	1633	Other then spotting no side effects for me :) but everyone is different.
23	1634	Although I had no pms symptoms, light spotting instead of a period, and never got pregnant once.
23	1635	I did have some spotting for several weeks shortly after I got it.
23	1636	The spotting did go on for longer than I thought but now has stopped.
23	1637	Only Pros would be no real periods after the first 2 months, occasional spotting when there is an increase of stress and no pregnancy.
23	1638	It's my 7th month on nexplanon and I'm still having random spotting.
23	1639	its very good at preventing pregnancy but I have been on my period for about 3 weeks (mainly consisting of spotting but still!)
23	1640	I have been spotting for a constant 3 weeks.
23	1641	I've been spotting for about 2 months with a few breaks in between the last three days.
23	1642	Of course the spotting is annoying but it's really nothing that can't be handled.
23	1643	I feel like my sex drive has either stayed the same or gone up just because I don't want to have sex with my bf on the days I am spotting so I literally look forward to those breaks.
23	1644	It was just spotting but lasted three weeks, ending last week (part of the month of July).
23	1645	There can be heavy bleeding at times or just some spotting.
23	1646	Although the bleeding was just spotting, it was there.
23	1647	The first 3 months I had some spotting & break through bleeding.
23	1648	Other days it was barely spotting so I never knew when I would need a pad because one day I was barely spotting and the next it went back to a regular flow period.
23	1649	I got my Nexplanon implant out today after being fed up with the heavy spotting since I got it in three months ago.
23	1650	Not only was I sick of the everyday spotting, I have been experiencing fatigue, headaches and mood swings.
23	1651	After about a month, I started spotting everyday and I haven't stopped since.
23	1652	It has been 10 months of constant spotting.
23	1653	I noticed some spotting on June 16th, and assumed I was having a light period since the color was the off brownish color you'd usually have towards the end of your cycle.
23	1654	The ONLY thing I do not like that is 100% the implants fault is constant, light, spotting.
23	1655	At the end of May the end of period bleeding came back for one week and right after spotting occurred and haven't stopped which means I am going into week three of bleeding.
23	1656	One thing I don't like about it so far is that I have light spotting ever since I've had it but it's not a burden.
23	1657	About 2 weeks after that I started spotting and it hasn't stopped since.
23	1658	No spotting, no intense mood swings just one or two so far but I can feel them coming on.
23	1659	I was on a constant period with a flow anywhere from medium to spotting.
23	1660	I got nexplanon  mid March 2015, was period free for a month mid April I got my period 3 weeks was just spotting now for a week I've had a heavy period non stop.
23	1661	This time around I have spotting that last for quite a few days it's not a steady flow as where with the implanon I had no period at all.
23	1662	By the time of my second period I only had minimal spotting.
23	1663	I've been on the implant for a month now and have not had any side effects and have yet to get my period or any spotting.
23	1664	Like most women I had uncontrolled spotting for the brunt of the time on nexplananon.
23	1665	I've taken it for a month, and boom, no spotting.
23	1666	Now I see why some people love nexplanon, it's awesome if you aren't spotting!
23	1667	I noticed that I have lost some of my sex drive, mood swings, and I've been spotting for 8 days after my 4 day period.
23	1668	For the first two months, about a third of the time I had spotting.
23	1669	Since then(last 4 months) I've only had a few days of spotting, hoping it stays that way.
23	1670	The first month I had no period or spotting :) The second month I had spotting that lasted 9 days, then had my period for 9 days, this was heavier & longer in duration for me than pre implant.
23	1671	During the first week, I had really heavy bleeding, which ultimately turned into spotting almost every day for the next three months until I finally decided to have it removed.
23	1672	And I'm not talking spotting, I mean bleeding moderately heavy everyday for 6 months.
23	1673	It's never been spotting, it's a full-on period all the time.
23	1674	Then, it was more like spotting for about 4ish days, and all i needed was panty liners.
23	1675	My bleeding was basically spotting for 2 months but I got used to it and dealt with it.
23	1676	I had mood swings, constant spotting.
23	1677	Had nausea the first couple weeks and I get occasional very light spotting.
23	1678	It's been about 8 days now and I'm still spotting.
23	1679	I've been spotting for more than three months straight!
23	1680	Around February 15, I had my normal, 4 day period but experienced extremely light spotting on and off for the next 4-5 weeks .
23	1681	Other than the initial spotting, I have not experienced any other side effects.
23	1682	The only issue is that I was supposed to get my period April 13 but I never got it so I figured the birth control changed my cycle but then on the 16th I had a little spotting so I thought my period was coming either the same day or the next day, but it's the next day since the spotting and I haven't got my period.
23	1683	I've had it for 2 years now and I have had constant spotting or bleeding throughout the entire time.
23	1684	My sex life isn't at its full potential because I don't want to have sex if I'm spotting...
23	1685	For now I'll deal with the spotting.
23	1686	The only down side is the constant spotting.
23	1687	First it was heavy for one week then light then heavy for two week now its just spotting and I think its about to go off but I can never be sure...just ready for it to go off because I'm tired of buying pads.
23	1688	Now my menstrual cycle lasts up to ten days and this month it stopped for 2 weeks and I started spotting again.
23	1689	I'm already spotting, which is normal but somewhat frustrating.
23	1690	I got it inserted 2 months ago, and after the 3rd week I started spotting (my normal period would have came a week after.)
23	1691	The light spotting was no big deal, but lately it's been pretty heavy as to where I have to wear a tampon, a panty liner is not enough.
23	1692	I had a follow up check up a month ago, and the Dr. said everything was good: my insertion spot had healed up nicely, and the spotting was normal.
23	1693	I have constant spotting with it but its not heavy and it doesn't leave anything on my underwear at all so that's pretty cool.
23	1694	My periods were super irregular I knew that was one of the side effects though I use to bleed a lot I was always spotting or on my period , not so much now I get the worst headaches ever out of nowhere and its so hard for me to get turned on.
23	1695	I've also had lots of spotting, which is expected and that should stop since I haven't had Nexplanon for very long.
23	1696	I think this is pretty great but the constant spotting can get in the way of a lot of things and can get really obnoxious and a little weight gain but other than that I think it's cool
23	1697	I don't get spotting, more periods I guess I am those lucky ones.
23	1698	During the middle of the second month I started spotting enough to have to wear tampons everyday and I'm up to my fifth month and still spotting.
23	1699	Since I got this in July, I haven't had periods just spotting at random times.
23	1700	I had light spotting for a whole month right after insertion.
23	1701	I had spotting for about 2-3 months, and my breast were ridiculously tender and hurt.
23	1702	But after that I had no more spotting and haven't had a period since.
23	1703	However spotting in he beginning.
23	1704	I know it protects me from having babies but the first month I was spotting every day.
23	1705	Now in my fourth month its the same, spotting every single day.
23	1706	Immediately after the first month, however, I started spotting enough to need to wear a panty liner all day, and I've been constantly spotting since.
23	1707	No periods, just constant spotting.
23	1708	No spotting or bleeding, periods just stopped.
23	1709	No spotting or anything!
23	1710	Constant spotting.
23	1711	I did have a little spotting, each time about a week before my period for a few days.
23	1712	Now I always am spotting, some days heavy flow.
23	1713	I just started spotting a few days ago.
23	1714	The first few months I only had spotting here and there a couple times during the month.
23	1715	However, I have had mood swings and every once in a while a little spotting whenever I wipe nothing crazy that's something I can handle.
23	1716	Then the 2nd year I started getting random spotting and now I have been having my period for 3 months on and off, weeks at a time.
23	1717	I got off my period before I got the Nexplanon since then small spotting.
23	1718	On Nexplanon I have not had a period but I have had about 3-4 weeks of spotting but it just recently stopped.
23	1719	The spotting isn't bad just very light and I usually only have to use 1-2 panty liners a day when I do spot.
23	1720	I have not had any other side effects other than spotting and low sex drive from time to time.
23	1721	My worst issues have been headaches and random spotting that happened off and on for the first few months but the headaches are never terrible and seem to have vanished now.
23	1722	I'm usually extremely sensitive to side effects and the ONLY thing bad I've encountered is constant spotting... just a little here and there when I wipe.
23	1723	I had it implanted in December of '13 and I have still yet to have any spotting or periods.
23	1724	I have had Nexplanon for about 2 months now and my spotting just stopped about a week ago.
23	1725	Constant spotting was frustrating but worth the effectiveness against pregnancy.
23	1726	For the about the first few weeks I was spotting and now I have nonexistent periods.
23	1727	I have little to no spotting, maybe twice in the past year but its short and light.
23	1728	I had bleeding for 10-15 days, it stopped for about a month and a half and now I'm spotting every time I'm ready to become intimate with my boyfriend or just random times.
23	1729	Yes it's very effective against pregnancy because you are constantly either spotting or bleeding unexpectedly.
23	1730	I have light irregular periods and some spotting.
23	1731	Lots of spotting, sometimes long periods maybe 10 days, no mood swings, no depression!
23	1732	About two weeks ago, when I was due for my period I began spotting and I have not stopped.
23	1733	It seems like you get mostly all the side effects or just spotting.
23	1734	I have been on Nex for about a month and a half and I started spotting about 10 days ago.
23	1735	Started spotting June 26th.
23	1736	I've had on and off bleeding and spotting for the past 3 months, sometimes heavy and sometimes brown spotting.
23	1737	I have very minimal side effects (occasional spotting) and I even lost some weight.
23	1738	The following month my period was only 5 days, with some spotting in between periods.
23	1739	After OVER a YEAR on it (and 15lbs later), I began spotting for 3 weeks straight.
23	1740	It didn't stop until I got it removed (I got it removed for the weight issue, not the spotting).
23	1741	I haven't had a period since I got the implant, no spotting or any bleeding at all.
23	1742	Spotting for two weeks then period for a week.. followed by a couple days spotting then two weeks later it starts all over again.
23	1743	Apart from light spotting for the first 2 month I had no period for the other 15 months.
23	1744	I had a normal period plus spotting for the first month then just constant spotting for thee next two months and finally nothing.
23	1745	No spotting either.
23	1746	I started slightly spotting today, like a dark brown, nothing a panty liner can't help.
23	1747	I have been on Nexplanon for a few months now and I either have a 2 week long period, a one week long period that is followed by a few weeks of spotting, or I have a 2 week long period followed by two to three days without bleeding at all then spotting followed by two more weeks of a period.
23	1748	I have not been able to have sex because I am always bleeding or spotting.
23	1749	I was warned about spotting before getting this.
23	1750	But I thought spotting meant a little bleeding here and there.
23	1751	But not so much bleeding as heavy spotting.
23	1752	Now in June 2014, I think the spotting is starting to subside.
23	1753	I have not had a normal period since insertion of implant, except for 2 spotting days.
23	1754	I didn't get a full blown period, just spotting for a week.
23	1755	I have somewhat regular periods, around the same time every month; however, it's more like spotting for three-four days.
23	1756	Since January, I get maybe 1 good week of no bleeding and then 3 weeks of heavy bleeding and spotting.
23	1757	I bled sporadically for 3 months and then have had random spotting for short periods every 3 months or so.
23	1758	Every once in a while I will get some very light spotting, but that's it.
23	1759	My periods are irregular, with brown clotty spotting lasting at least 20 days a month.
23	1760	Until I got spotting again.
23	1761	About a week after I started spotting and haven't stopped since.
23	1762	Since they have both cleared up, I've actually lost weight and my breasts have grown, I sometimes get a little spotting but never a full blown period, and overall I think it's a brilliant method of contraception.
23	1763	I then had 2 weeks of no bleeding then 7 days bleeding, more like 2 days bleeding and 5 days spotting or brown discharge.
23	1764	I just recently started spotting 3 days ago and so far it's pretty light.
23	1765	So far no problems, no spotting, nothing.
23	1766	I had Nexplanon implant put in in September 2013, a week after it was put in, I started spotting and it hasn't stopped since.
23	1767	If the spotting stops in the next month or two, I would rate this even higher.
23	1768	I didn't have a period or any spotting at all until now in March 2014.
23	1769	For the first week after it was inserted, I had a "normal" period and after that, it went away and I have not had another period at all (not even spotting!)
23	1770	I been on Neplanon for 5 months now, at first it was cool spotting for 2 days then stop.
23	1771	Now I have been spotting for 2 months and gaining weight.
23	1772	It hasn't gotten lighter, and it's not spotting.
23	1773	It was annoying for a good month and a half almost two from constant bleeding and spotting.
23	1774	If having the bleeding and spotting for long times I would hang in there.
23	1775	I got Nexplanon inserted 5 months now and the first 3 months I was spotting non-stop and after that I would lightly spot once a month for 2 days which I assume is probably my period.
23	1776	Since then I've only had a few days of spotting and nothing else.
23	1777	I'm not having full periods but I'm constantly spotting throughout the day.
23	1778	I had bleeding and spotting non stop for an entire year.
23	1779	I have been experiencing random spotting, but it has been very light.
23	1780	That was my reason for switching) no hair loss and only super minor spotting.
23	1781	I haven't had a period since then until today, which is slight spotting.
23	1782	I didn't have any spotting or periods up until the 4th of January.
23	1783	I was in place for about 2 weeks then I started spotting very lightly for only 3 weeks.
23	1784	I had a week menstruation-free, and have had heavy spotting to moderate bleeding everyday since.
23	1785	After taking them for 5 days, the spotting stopped.
23	1786	I have had a few heavy periods but just mainly constant spotting and heavy discharge.
23	1787	I haven't had a period in a month and a half, or spotted so I'm hoping this means the periods and spotting are over.
23	1788	I did have spotting for a few months and some moodiness.
23	1789	I had some spotting for about a month after, which was a pain, but i'm so glad i pushed through it.
23	1790	Although it took two months to regulate, my period is now 5-7 days of light spotting every 2 months.
23	1791	I bled every day and it ranged from a regular period flow to spotting that was on the heavy side.
23	1792	I've experienced strange periods, lots of spotting, and HORRIBLE mood swings, along with constantly being tired (all of this after the implant had broken) I'm absolutely appalled at the way that my situation has been handled thus far, I've tried getting in contact with both my doctor and the manufacturing company numerous times, still with no answer.
23	1793	At first it was great, I wasn't having a period (for about 3 months), I did have occasional spotting but it didn't bother me.
23	1794	The last two months it's been just a light spotting off and on for about 3-4 days.
23	1795	At first my periods were a little unpredictable, with prolonged bleeding and irregular spotting, but everything evened out eventually.
23	1796	I have been spotting since yesterday but it is on schedule for my cycle.
23	1797	Since getting Nexplanon 3 months ago, my period has come about every week and a half and then between the periods I'm almost constantly spotting.
23	1798	If I'm still spotting and having these miserable periods by the end of the year I will definitely get it removed although I am hoping they stop so I can keep it because I like not having to worry about getting pregnant or needing on-hand contraception with me.
23	1799	The first couple months I had irregular bleeding and spotting.
23	1800	No spotting, I haven't gained any weight, my hair is not falling out, and zero signs of depression.
23	1801	Today I started spotting, very lightly.
23	1802	I have had some light spotting here and there and not knowing when to expect a period can be a pain, but the positives outweigh the negatives.
23	1803	I started bleeding 10 days later and have had spotting ever since.
23	1804	I am supposed to have my period this week and its heavier than the usual spotting but not to bad.
23	1805	No spotting at all.
23	1806	I have no spotting and no weight gain.
23	1807	After that, I was spotting lightly on and off for another week.
23	1808	The only thing I did notice was when my cycle was due I was PMSing like usual but had no bleeding or spotting to go with it.
23	1809	I've lost 3 pounds in only 3 weeks, and my other issues also seem to be resolved and I have had no issues with spotting thus far.
23	1810	Here's how my experience has been so far: extremely clear skin, no breakthrough bleeding or spotting, no mood swings, pain, headaches or nausea, bigger breasts.
23	1811	For the first 2 weeks I was spotting from the change of birth control, but nothing too terrible.
23	1812	I haven't had any bleeding or spotting.
23	1813	I got off my period the day before insertion and the day after insertion I started heavy bleeding again for 2 weeks, then spotting which lasted 4 weeks straight.
23	1814	The spotting isn't so bad & has gotten lighter.
23	1815	Ever since then I've only had light spotting.
23	1816	I didn't get my cycle for a month and a half then got it at the end of Feb. Had it for a week then stopped but spotted then period came back for another week and still had some spotting and now I still have it.
23	1817	To start, I had spotting for 3 wks and then it stopped.
23	1818	However, sex caused the spotting to return for wks.
23	1819	It made my period lighter but every since I've had it I haven't stopped spotting.
23	1820	Sometimes it would be all day spotting or just a few hours.
23	1821	But since then I haven't had anything really just maybe one day a month of spotting.
23	1822	I had immediately 4 days of heavy bleeding, then no bleeding at all until 2 Weeks ago I started spotting and it hasn't stopped.
23	1823	I finished my cycle, had a week of no bleeding, then I had slight spotting for almost a month.
23	1824	I would get moody every so often and I would spot every few months.
23	1825	I was told that it would be normal for the first 2 or 3 months to spot or bleed, as it was my body becoming used to it.
23	1826	Would have a period for 1 week then none for a month and a half-2months If I went 2 months without then I'd have it for 1 week spot for a day or so then had it another 4 days
23	1827	In the first 9 months I did spot a lot.
23	1828	My periods are so crazy, I spot so much.
23	1829	Once one spot goes away, I'll have a day where there's none and low and behold another appears.
23	1830	that was the "norm" it would stop then I would randomly spot and it was a mess it was so irregular.
23	1831	Now I only spot for about 3 days about every 3 or 4 months.
23	1832	I did begin to spot after for about 2 weeks when I decided to take some of my remaining birth control pills which actually took care of the problem.
23	1833	Insertion was a breeze, they numb the spot and wrap you up when you're done, easy.
23	1834	Around the time I would normally get my period, I began to spot for two weeks straight.
23	1835	The second year was a little better, some days I didn't spot at all and completely forgot about the implant.
23	1836	Then I would spot for a few days, stop for two days, and start bleeding heavy again.
23	1837	I did have a few side effects that I did not enjoy at first but after a few months my body got used  to it and now I barely get my period and if I do I just spot for like a week .
23	1838	Only thing is I can't predict when is my next period so my husband assumes I'm pregnant, but when it does come I only spot for a few days.
23	1839	I was super worried that I'd spot on Nexplanon because that seemed to be the main problem with this method.
23	1840	In the last 6 months, it's changed to where I spot very often and for long periods at a time.
23	1841	It ranges from just a spot to a full period.
23	1842	I would spot for a day a month and then after that it would go right back into a full period.
23	1843	I still spot every now and then but it's never a regular 7 day period.
23	1844	I even spot between periods.
23	1845	I would be spot free for a few days then bleeding again.
23	1846	I did spot for a week or two after first getting it, but it was brief.
23	1847	The first 4 months I spot bleed everyday.
23	1848	Also, I could spot for a couple of days and then stop.
23	1849	Unlike other people who stopped getting a period, I literally spot every day and it is frustrating.
23	1850	My doc numbed the spot opened it a bit stuck the stick in and bandage.
23	1851	I cleaned the spot put a&d on the spot, within a week or 2 no spot no itching.
23	1852	My experience is the first couple months I would spot but then no periods until about the last 3 months or so before having it removed.
23	1853	i spot a lot, probably every other week so far after having it in for a month.
23	1854	The only issue I've had is every time my boyfriend and I have sex, I spot the next day for less than a week.
23	1855	I spot a little every once in a while but no complaints!
23	1856	I started to spot for weeks, my moods were changing a lot, my migraines were harsh, had no sex drive at all.
23	1857	I would spot for two weeks, and be on my period for a week.
23	1858	I only spot for a day or two, and only once or twice during the day.
23	1859	I got this implant shortly after my c-section.. My periods have been so irregular and I spot for months...I got it January 2013 today may 4 2016 I began my period a couple days ago and it's never been this heavy and clotted I don't know if this is normal I have to change my tampon every hour it's a regular size tampon but I feel light headed too idk but this implant has been not worth the mess is rather just have it once a month for a week then deal with this!!
23	1860	I spot all the time and I do mean all the time.
23	1861	I then went to sporatic periods (on one week, spot the next, nothing a few days, then BAM back to bleeding)  I have gained 30 pounds on this and can not lose it for the life of me, no diet or exercise regimen will work.
23	1862	The first year was a little rough because it was very hard to track my periods, and I would spot randomly.
23	1863	At first I noticed no change but by the second week I began to spot a lot... this turned into a 4 MONTH nonstop period!!!
23	1864	But, this does change the lining of your uterus to have a lot more mucus, and that does sorta spot out from time to time.
23	1865	I will bleed heavily for weeks at a time, and spot in between.
23	1866	In the first month I would spot off and on, but it was never anything really heavy.
23	1867	I did randomly spot months later ..
23	1868	At first I'd spot here & there, then 2 weeks at a time.
23	1869	I used to spot or have weird long periods but I don't anymore.
23	1870	I do spot a lot every other two weeks or so but its light & I just put a liner down just in case.
23	1871	After that first week I spotted, and have continued to spot for the past TWO months.
23	1872	The worst side effect is I spot at least 25 days a month, sometimes I will bleed up to 3 months straight, stop for 2 or 3 days then start bleeding again.
23	1873	It wasn't too terrible to get out other than the numbing shot was somewhat painful (felt like getting stung by multiple bees in the same spot) and it was a rather quick procedure.
23	1874	I was just coming off the depo shot and starting to spot.
23	1875	I did spot for 2 weeks about a year ago but it wasn't nothing I couldn't handle.
23	1876	Since then, I spot every so often.
23	1877	I bled for about the first 3months irregularly, now I spot rarely every now and then.
23	1878	I had one regular period then not a spot, and when I did bleed it was only one day and very light, I was on it for 5 years.
23	1879	I had no period for around 6 months but once it hit 6 months I started to spot for a whole month!
23	1880	The second week I started to spot and have been every day since then.
23	1881	I spot every few months or so.
23	1882	Other than that I spot a lot.
23	1883	The only negative is that I spot very lightly at least once a month for a few days but nothing unbearable.
23	1884	The spot where it's located in my arm hurts from time to time.
23	1885	Sometimes I'll randomly spot here and there, which can get a little annoying.
23	1886	My first 2 weeks I didn't spot or anything.
23	1887	No such luck every month til now i have my period and spot for 2 weeks out of the month.
23	1888	As of now, I am experiencing lighter periods, but I seem to spot every other week.
23	1889	I did have the initial arm pain around the implantation site, but I didn't spot right after the implant.
23	1890	I did spot for a couple of days when I first got it inserted but other than that no complaints.
23	1891	I would spot the first week than have a heavy flow the next.
23	1892	I still spot, randomly.
23	1893	but its so annoying because I spot for 3 weeks, that's way too long.
23	1894	The only problem now is I spot for three weeks (somedays worse than others) but then no period/spotting for two months.
23	1895	For the first 4 months, I got my period very heavy for about a week and would spot everyday after my period until the next month.
23	1896	After that stage, I would have a period for about 2 weeks and wouldn't spot for about 2 weeks.
23	1897	Not to mention I am extremely emotional and my "period" is irregular, much lighter but I probably spot 20  days out of the month.
23	1898	The first 3 days the spot where it was implanted it stung a little.
23	1899	I lost about 15 pounds, my insertion spot is completely healed, I did get nauseous once, but other than that I'm completely happy.
23	1900	The only side effect I think I've experienced is spot bleeding.
23	1901	I don't get a full period, but i do spot a tiny bit randomly.
23	1902	I was on my first day of period when getting it, it automatically stopped it & I haven't bleed since, not even spot.
23	1903	At first I did spot for 2 months but nothing heavy or even compared to what my normal cycles were.
23	1904	Best part is that I always know where it is and can make sure that it is in the correct spot.
23	1905	I would spot occasionally and maybe where a panty liner.
23	1906	Sometimes I'll spot, sometimes I'll bleed for just a day.
23	1907	I spot about twice a month now, each time only being 2 to 3 days.
23	1908	Throughout almost the entire month of December, I spotted.
23	1909	Ever since then, I haven’t had a period but I have spotted a little bit.
23	1910	For the first 4-5 months, I did not have a period but just spotted very lightly here and there and was still able to have sex.
23	1911	Never had regular periods so I spotted for about 4 months after the insertion so I started the pill as well which regulates my periods; though it can be annoying to have to remember a pill.
23	1912	I got the implant in January of 2015,  I spotted and had a light/medium period every day for about two and a half months which of course sucked but I thought it would stop once the implant "kicked in" and my body got used to it.
23	1913	Rating this a 9 because I spotted for a month after insertion.
23	1914	By the 3rd month I have very faint spotted bleeding.
23	1915	I got it my 6 week check up and had no issues until 2 weeks after it was put in I spotted for a week then started a full blown period that lasted 10 days.
23	1916	I spotted for the first month and half though.
23	1917	On the implant I did not have periods, just spotted when I was stressed which I loved.
23	1918	I got this years ago when it was still called "implanon" I didn't like  it because I spotted a ton and I had just moved half way across the country so it might have been stressed.
23	1919	And the bleeding was the worst I always had to wear a liner because I spotted at random times.
23	1920	I then spotted brownish light blood for another 5 days that eventually stopped.
23	1921	Between those dates I spotted constantly never had a consistent cycle had horrible mood swings to the point my husband didn't even know who I was - I was so awful to him at times.
23	1922	I haven't gotten a period or spotted at all.
23	1923	During the first 6 months, I spotted to light bled everyday.
23	1924	At the beginning, I only spotted for 2-3 weeks.
23	1925	I never spotted or anything.
23	1926	I've been on nexplenon for almost a year now and I can't remember a day since that I haven't bled or at least spotted.
23	1927	I've been on it for a year and have spotted every single day for a year now.
23	1928	I don't have any unusual mood swings, and have not spotted or anything along those lines.
23	1929	I got the nexplanon October 22nd of 2015 and I spotted for a month and hadn't had a period since.
23	1930	When I first got it I spotted for about 2 weeks.
23	1931	Then I spotted for another month.
23	1932	However, this is my second time getting the Nexplanon implant (this is my fourth year now), and the only issue I had with it was when I first got it inserted, I spotted for about two months straight.
23	1933	Since then I spotted for months on end plus a period that starts very very heavy (heavier than before I ever took any birth control).
23	1934	I broke out horribly, had terrible mood swings and still spotted periodically.
23	1935	When I first had it put in, I bled and spotted for 6 months, which I was warned would happen.
23	1936	I haven't had a period in 5 years except I spotted for a day or two maybe twice during the five years.
23	1937	Once my period stopped, I spotted for about 3 weeks, nothing terrible.
23	1938	I spotted on & off for 3mo.
23	1939	I spotted for about 5 days after and haven't had a period since.
23	1940	I got this inserted May 20th and spotted for a weekish.
23	1941	I too spotted for many months, but within the last 2 years I began to regulate every 28 days.
23	1942	I spotted  lightly but basically continuously for the first 5 months.
23	1943	after insertion my period left and about 3 months later I spotted for 3 days and nothing since.
23	1944	I have had nexplanon for about a year and a half now, the first six months I spotted off and on and was a little moody.
23	1945	I've spotted before but nothing like how a period is.
23	1946	I spotted for about 3 and a half weeks after I got nexplanon put in my arm and have not bled since!
23	1947	I spotted for a few days after I got this implant but I haven't had any bleeding since!!
23	1948	The first three months I spotted nonstop and I've had horrible anxiety problems and depression.
23	1949	It was sore a couple of days after insertion and I spotted for about a week the second month.
23	1950	I spotted some then Ive had No periods/cramps/crazy symptoms since.
23	1951	Yes, it was easy to use and effective (no pregnancies), but I bled or spotted three weeks out of the month for the TWO years I had the nexplanon.
23	1952	After bleeding for about 11 days, I spotted for about 7 more days.
23	1953	I got the implant 10/13/15 and I spotted for about 2 weeks then I had nothing for the next 6 months.
23	1954	When I first got nexplanon I spotted for 2 months and after that I haven't had a period since the end of February.
23	1955	Once Inserted, I stopped bleeding for 2 weeks and ever since then I've bled and spotted nonstop.
23	1956	I only spotted for a couple days the first month after that i never got my period or spotted again.
23	1957	Had one period right after insertion and spotted only once in 18 months since.
23	1958	I very lightly spotted for the first time a few weeks ago, but I think that was just because I was spending a lot of time with other girls who were on their periods (I have a long and annoying history of syncing periods).
23	1959	Good thing, I've only spotted a couple times since.
23	1960	So yes my ache was terrible I gained weight because I would get the shakes if I didn't eat, I didn't have any energy and I was so moody like to the point I thought I would have a nervous break down, I spotted for two weeks at a time, but now I have no periods and I'm normal
23	1961	I spotted for the first week and now my periods have stopped.
23	1962	I spotted for about a week and now I think I just got my period.
23	1963	It lasted a day and then I spotted for two weeks.
23	1964	And well so far so good, in the beginning I spotted a bit here and there and now I haven't had my period since August 2015 I believe.
23	1965	About 3 months I spotted for about 5 days.
23	1966	Then the 4th month I spotted for about 5 days, stopped for a day or so & started back for about another 5 days.
23	1967	When I first got it, I spotted for about a month and a half and then I completely stopped getting a period since then.
23	1968	Stopped for a week, then I spotted for 3 more weeks.
23	1969	I got my implant put in December 9 ,2015 and today is January 4,2016 my last period wasn't a period I mainly spotted and agreed for about week and half I discharge brown discharge and a few head aches still have few head aches I've also gained weight just a few pounds so far I like it I would refer it to anyone who doesn't want kids for the next 3 years
23	1970	I spotted once in a while, maybe once every 4-5 months just for a couple days.
23	1971	To top it off I spotted light pink and brown for two days randomly a couple weeks ago.
23	1972	Had mine inserted around the end of April missed my period for 2 weeks than bled heavily for a month and spotted ever since :/ some days were heavier than others, I have gone through so many panty liners I actually missed my normal period while I was on it.
23	1973	I've probably had 2 cycles and that only lasted 3 days and it only spotted.
23	1974	My implant was inserted in July 2014 and for the first six months, I spotted every day.
23	1975	I haven't spotted or had a period in 3 months.
23	1976	After about 4 days my period started and lasted about two weeks but after that I haven't even spotted once.
23	1977	I spotted on and off for about a month.
23	1978	First, I spotted for six months straight but had no other side effects.
23	1979	I've only had 1 actual period and have spotted at least 3-4 times.
23	1980	I spotted for 2 weeks and have not had a period since getting the implant put in.
23	1981	Since I had it put in, I have spotted every single day except for last month when I had a four day reprieve.
23	1982	When it comes to bleeding, I have spotted through an entire month, and while I'm on my period, one day it's heavy, the next it's almost not there at all.
23	1983	With this implant life has been great, period stopped that month and have only spotted once just recently.
23	1984	In February of 2015 I spotted a few days then went away.
23	1985	I have spotted a little, the heaviest was for two or three days at the most & I have not had a period yet.
23	1986	I bled or spotted until the end of February 2015.
23	1987	Everything was cool I bled my whole 6 weeks then my period completely stopped until the first week of Feb I spotted for a few days(3).
23	1988	First, I've spotted on and off with this birth control.
23	1989	I only spotted for a couple days after getting it and then my period had stopped all together.
23	1990	Spotting everyday for the first month, no period at all the second month, spotted every day the third month, stopped for a week and spotted for another 3 weeks straight.
23	1991	Had a regular period for 3 weeks, then I just spotted for a month and a half.
23	1992	Since then I haven't had a period or spotted at all.
23	1993	I've only spotted once.
23	1994	I haven't had a period, bled, or even spotted since.
23	1995	I've "spotted" for 2mos straight before.
23	1996	I've spotted a couple of times but never an actual period.
23	1997	I spotted, dark brown, for the first two weeks on it and then nothing until a month later.
23	1998	I've spotted for a short period of time and did not experience my period the first month.
23	1999	And my third was a week light as well then 2 weeks after I spotted for a week.
23	2000	I spotted for about a month and a half, which I expected.
23	2001	A week or two after having it inserted I spotted and discharged on and off which was really annoying being that I have a high sex drive and I'm not the type to have sex while I'm discharging or on my period.
23	2002	I had this implanted in late July 2013 and spotted the next week for a day.
23	2003	I had a regular period (5 days) a week after I got it put in, and since I've only spotted twice, each so light I only had to use a liner, and only lasted for a day.
23	2004	After that, I spotted a couple times but nothing heavy, painful or long-lasting.
23	2005	Haven't spotted or had a period since, knock on wood.
23	2006	I spotted lightly for about 2 weeks straight beginning 8 days after insertion but then it went away and I've had ZERO bleeding since then.
23	2007	Then I spotted for about 2 1/2 months.
23	2008	I got a bad headache that  lasted over a week.
23	2009	Then after that, I experienced a headache for three days.
23	2010	I've had a constant headache for the last 10 days as well as dizzy spells.
23	2011	The insertion was a breeze but the two weeks following it I was depressed and had a ongoing headache.
23	2012	I had a headache about an hour after I got it put in until  about 6 months later when I had it taken out.
23	2013	I have had a constant headache since I got it out in.
23	2014	It worked great far as not getting pregnant for 3 years, but I dealt with a lot of side effects: depression, mood swings, change of appetite, back pain, headache, an increase of discharge, and irregular periods
23	2015	I've been on the implant for 5 days now and started to have constant headache with face and body tingling , itching and whole  body aches
23	2016	And sometimes I don't like to go out because I feel too dizzy or have a crazy headache.
23	2017	I have developed random numbness in my arm and the occasional chest pain along with a constant headache.
23	2018	I got my arm implant on May 24th and so far everything was good, no weight gain, headache , no side effects...
23	2019	Hi I'm 21 years old and got this arm implant fitted about 3 weeks ago I've not had any serious side effects only mild bloating nausea and minor headache I was meant to get my monthly period on the 25th of May how ever now its the 3rd of June I've still not had a period yet.
23	2020	I experienced absolutely no negative side effects, not once having headache or nausea or anything.
23	2021	Headaches for the first five months (as in, I had a headache for three out of every ten days).
23	2022	I had it put in September of 2015 and it has been nothing but a headache.
23	2023	I have pain in my lower leg, chest pains that make my breathing feel even heavier and clenching, stomach pains even though my diet has been consistent and watched for the past few months,  and now this throbbing headache that won't go away.
23	2024	I bled from Feb 2016- April 2016 which was a headache because I was spending more money than I wanted to on pads!
23	2025	The first 2 months was constantly having headache which I never had before and soreness in my breast.
23	2026	I have a pretty high pain tolerance so it shocked me when I couldn't function because of a headache.
23	2027	I have had migraine headache since I could remember.
23	2028	I have had a headache every single day non stop ever since starting this method, I thought it was just me, until I researched and discovered nexaplanon could be responsible for that.
23	2029	I had it for a year, I had never experienced migraines until I got this in, Now I constantly have headache!
23	2030	The insertion wasn't painful but within hours I was lethargic, tearful, sweating and had an horrendous headache.
23	2031	I've had this thing in my arm for about a week now and it has been hell, I'm nauseous and have a headache ALL THE TIME.
23	2032	And waking up with a headache everyday is killing me.
23	2033	Maybe a headache here and there.
23	2034	Lately ive started gettings headaches for 4-5days straight no matter what I take I continue to have a headache and increased appetite.
23	2035	As far as side effects, I felt a bit moody for about 2 weeks and I had a headache for a few days when I first got the implant.
23	2036	Had a minor headache shortly after insertion and had an ugly bruise for a while, but as far as side effects, that was it.
23	2037	There's no bruising, no pain but last night I had a serious headache and some nausea.
23	2038	I did have slight headache last night.
23	2039	I have been having it since Aug 2015, it comes out Aug 2017 debating if I'm going to  get it back in.. mood swings are terrible, headaches that last 3-4days a week suck.
23	2040	I get headaches sometimes.
23	2041	I finally had it taken out yesterday and I’ve been having nausea and headaches.
23	2042	I was having constant headaches, but I just took Advil to relieve it.
23	2043	I have been extremely nauseous, dizzy, ears ringing, headaches, convulsions, and full blown panic attacks.
23	2044	I got it taken out 3 months ago & I'm still feeling depressed & have horrible headaches & beyond tired .
23	2045	For the last year I have had on & off nausea, headaches, moody, anxious.
23	2046	I did get a big nauseated, and had headaches.
23	2047	I've had my implant for a year now and tho it has prevent a pregnancy the first 3 months were great no complaints but then I started getting headaches everyday.
23	2048	After a few months, I realized that some other problems I've been experiencing can be linked to Nexplanon- anxiety/depression (it's gotten pretty bad), headaches, dizziness, fatigue (I'm more tired every day now than I was in either of my pregnancies), etc.
23	2049	No increase in weight, headaches, breast tenderness, depression, or sex drive.
23	2050	Mood swings , headaches, breast pain here and there, pain in my bladder area , also depression and anxiety.
23	2051	I started to experience feeling dizzy a lot, lightheaded, really bad headaches and also nausea.
23	2052	Thank God my appointment for removal is tomorrow, I have had a period since I had it inserted, headaches, awful nausea for the past two weeks and feeling super depressed and tired.
23	2053	No headaches, no weight gain, no bleeding, and my sex drive increased which obviously I wasn't complaining!
23	2054	Also, I never had a history of having headaches but after getting it I do get a few headaches here and there that last 5 minutes but nothing bad.
23	2055	I don't have headaches, nor have I had any problems (side effects) besides  the weight gain.
23	2056	I still get the mild headaches everyday, Motrin helps with that.
23	2057	Even since I've had Nexplanon I've gained mad weight that no matter how much I workout I can't lose, when I think my cycle is over it's not and the headaches are the worst.
23	2058	I used to love it, but I started noticing that I've been getting constant, raging headaches that can last for days with little to no relief, even with the use of pain meds.
23	2059	I cry for no reason at times and get Bad headaches.
23	2060	Be aware before getting this that if you have a lot of migraines or headaches all the time, the nexplanon may make them worse!
23	2061	I very very rarely get headaches but a few days in I was getting some headaches but it was fine after an hour.
23	2062	I'm a woman so between stress, a 3yr old, financial issues, family problems and baby daddy problems I'm going to be moody, have headaches, bleed irregular sometimes cuz of stress, loss of appetite, get depressed, gain weight so I DO recommend it but everyone's body is different so I have to find what makes u comfortable.
23	2063	I was on BC pills for 3 years, but decided to try something different because the pills tend to give me headaches.
23	2064	The nexplanon also gave me bad headaches.
23	2065	I've had constant bleeding, the worst headaches ever, psychotic mood swings, out of control anger, depression, And the worst.. low sex drive.
23	2066	What really is driving me to get this removed are the headaches that it causes as well as feeling light headed, nauseous, tender breasts, and tired all the time.
23	2067	After a year and a half of having it, I started getting pregnancy symptoms (nausea, bloating, headaches, back pain, etc.).
23	2068	I'm always nauseous, have headaches, dizziness, severe mood swings and anxiety.
23	2069	I have had the implant for 4 years now and the only problem I've been having is headaches when my period is about to come on.
23	2070	I also got a concussion a month ago and I think the nexplanon has made some of the symptoms much worse such as headaches, sleep, mood, and energy level.
23	2071	This happens all the time, either I have a period or I don't; either its super heavy, and I feel awful between bloating, headaches, body aches for a couple of days; or I have a very light and spotty period for a week and a half where its impossible for plan for.
23	2072	I had bad headaches for the first month.
23	2073	But if you dont want headaches everyday, have fatigue everyday, gain so much weight and ECT do not get it.
23	2074	I became depressed, had mood swings, I had absolutely no sex drive, headaches, and I gained 15 pounds (Not sure if it was my lifestyle because I am a lifeguard and am always swimming).
23	2075	The first month I had about three headaches a day, now I get about two a week.
23	2076	I would get really bad headaches, mood swings are horrible and no sex drive at all!!
23	2077	I would get headaches, increased appetite, which made me gain weight, I would have mood swings and not feel like myself, and I would even get tender breast and nausea.
23	2078	But the negative is, I gained 20+ pounds, I get sharp pains in my abdomen, I also get pains where it was implanted, I have no sex drive anymore, headaches and feeling nauseous.
23	2079	Went through a withdrawal of bad headaches 1 week after.
23	2080	I've noticed after getting the implant I've felt more depressed, anxious, nauseous, and have been having huge headaches that don't seem to go away for days at a time.
23	2081	The frequent headaches (migraines sometimes) were annoying.
23	2082	No headaches and no PMS.
23	2083	I get headaches and I am lethargic.
23	2084	I also tend to have headaches that last for days on end.
23	2085	My mood has changed a lot since I then and my headaches are very severe when I get them.
23	2086	Constant headaches effecting work and stopping me getting enough sleep.
23	2087	Pain in the lower leg that doesn't go away, occasional swollen face, sudden severe headaches, longer and heavier periods, sever mood swings, feeling really sad, can't seem to loose any weight.
23	2088	I have had no period, and the only side effect I noticed was some headaches that I do not usually get.
23	2089	Week 3 I'm now experiencing constant headaches, nausea, feeling light-headed and faint.
23	2090	I experience a few headaches and abdominal pain.
23	2091	I haven't gained any weight, no headaches, no mood swings no nothing!
23	2092	The implant also made me extremely tired and have frequent headaches and mood swings.
23	2093	Ever since I've had it, I've experienced severe headaches that happen at least once every week.
23	2094	First couple weeks I got headaches.
23	2095	I started to get headaches every other day and migraines, and I NEVER get migraines ever!
23	2096	I got on the Nexplanon the same day I had my baby, Feb 9 2016, I have gained over 24 pounds, I just recently began having headaches almost everyday, my ankles swell up a lot, and i'm extra moody.
23	2097	That stopped in January after that I started to feel dizzy had brain fog and the headaches are horrible.
23	2098	No serious complaints beside some minor headaches and increased hormone levels.
23	2099	Horrific headaches every day.
23	2100	I have been getting headaches all the time, and my stomach constantly aches.
23	2101	The first while was awful; mood swings, severe headaches, the works.
23	2102	No symptoms besides a few minor headaches and some dizziness.
23	2103	It made me sick, have headaches, gain weight, nauseous, tired, a 4 month long period, and severe anxiety and depression (which was so overwhelming it was the #1 reason I got it out early).
23	2104	I'm lucky enough to not have irregular bleeding or become pregnant but I've gained 20 pounds, have mood swings, get headaches, no sex drive, and don't feel like myself!!!
23	2105	At the begging, I did experience headaches, but that only lasted for about a week or two.
23	2106	The only thing I could complain about is headaches and mood swings.
23	2107	Headaches, I used to have intense headaches with my previous birth control and I still have them with this kind but not as severe.
23	2108	I had mine removed last Thursday 2016 to see if it helps lesson the headaches, also found out that I beat cancer in the booty.
23	2109	I have not had severe side effects i do get headaches but they might be due to my lack of sleep.
23	2110	Plus I had horrible headaches.
23	2111	I don't think I gained much weight or got headaches, but my emotional (as well as physical) state did change.
23	2112	Gained about 40+ pounds in 6 months which is crazy, mood swings, complete and total loss of sex drive, headaches and had a period for 3 weeks and it was completely irregular.
23	2113	I've had for Nexplanom since the beginning of of February, 2016 and since then I've had uncontrollable mood swings, suicidal thoughts, breakouts that I usually never get, terrible back and hip pain, I always bleed during sex (it is never  rough or something that would cause bleeding), I never stop bleeding to some degree, I get more frequent headaches, it's like I could go on and on.
23	2114	I have had a couple of headaches, but nothing that wasn't cured from excedrin migraine.
23	2115	I can barely tell I have it in and have had no other problems such as fatigue,  weight gain,  or headaches.
23	2116	I have had mood swings, excruciating headaches, depression, and weight gain of 30 pounds!!
23	2117	One time my boyfriend hit it and I almost puked.I got headaches all the time and I had my period for 8 WEEKS!
23	2118	The only complaint I have is that I've had headaches 2-3 times a day randomly.
23	2119	I do get headaches sometimes, but they're not unbearable, go away with painkillers, and I can't tell if it's from hormones or something else.
23	2120	Really bad headaches and abdominal pain.
23	2121	Absolutely zero side effects for me: I never gained weight, my skin stayed clear, no headaches, and my periods got lighter.
23	2122	I did plenty of research before, so I knew what to expect in the first few months, as far as bleeding/spotting, headaches, etc.
23	2123	I never got headaches prior to using this birth control, I had them constantly for three weeks straight.
23	2124	After starting to workout again, the weight is falling off so it's not due to the Nexplanon.I don't break out, get headaches, or mood swings aside from when it's time for my actual period.I've always had a high sex drive so it wasn't affected at all.
23	2125	I haven't cried once since giving birth, don't get headaches and had been happy and relaxed - this reaction had to be a result to the nexplanon.
23	2126	I have also randomly experienced headaches, backaches, sore nipples, brownish discharge & nausea.
23	2127	I have been on this nexplanon carp for a year since last feburary.and let me tell u I would rather have stayed on the shot and deal with the long term effects than what I'm going through now I have bad headaches.
23	2128	The other down side, is headaches and the blood!
23	2129	My personal side effects are weight gain, headaches, diarrhea, and sore boobs all the time.
23	2130	I don't feel any of the other adverse side effects of oral contraceptives (I frequently would have severe headaches during my period).
23	2131	For a brief time I experienced severe headaches, and tirdness, but that passed.
23	2132	And but I still get the continuous headaches.
23	2133	After getting it inserted I did get headaches but they wouldn't last very long.
23	2134	I didn't gain weight, no headaches, no extended menstrual cycles.
23	2135	I never got my period, I gained 60  pounds, I had very bad headaches to the point where I couldn't watch tv  with the sound was on 3 and the tv light was really bothering, I ate non-stop it was like I was always hungry, I would cry for no reason, it made me feel confused for some reason, I was VERY aggressive I beat up my boyfriend, my mom, anybody who was messing with me and towards the end of my months I was very sensitive.
23	2136	I got the implant a little over 2 years ago it does prevent pregnancy but I bleed twice a month I get dizzy nauseous headaches and now a rash on both my arms and my leg and have now discovered that the implant broke in my arm ..I wouldn't recommend it
23	2137	I also had headaches for the first 3 weeks and was very irritable.
23	2138	First off I've had headaches and even migraines since I got it put in (which I NEVER get.)
23	2139	Second, I have had headaches at least 4 days a week since I had my BC placed.
23	2140	At first I would get a lot of headaches but they've died down now, and I've also been very "gaggy," any little smell, texture, or sight of something gross makes me gag a lot.
23	2141	I have migraines and headaches.
23	2142	Which would explain why I have ringing in the ears, hard of hearing, vision going bad, headaches, migraines, and such I ignored it because I thought it was side effects.
23	2143	Over all effective did not become pregnant but from the start I had horrible side effect with headaches, my hair falling out & no periods (so thought was a good thing).
23	2144	I haven't had a single period since but I do have excruciating headaches, I get blurred vision and hard of hearing with them.
23	2145	I get really bad headaches and pains in my arm.
23	2146	I at first thought this would be a good "3 year plan" however I have had my period now for 5 months, headaches, 0 sex drive, and weight gain.
23	2147	What I can't deal with is the constant headaches.
23	2148	I also noticed that I get slight headaches but they usually either go away or I take medicine for it.
23	2149	Then I began experiencing very bad anxiety along with depression.Ive had very bad headaches constantly along with feeling like I was pregnant all the time.
23	2150	I've had it for only just over a week but have had the following symptoms: a couple unexplained light headaches (I never get headaches) but these are pretty easily treatable with one advil, it is pretty itchy right now as well, and finally, I am a little dryer during sex, which has been a little frustrating.
23	2151	I notice I get minor headaches almost every day but they go away after an hour or so.
23	2152	Now that the bleeding is gone I still cant lose this weight and I have massive headaches at time.
23	2153	I have been feeling more aggressive, more headaches, more fatigue and I have noticed that I have lost patience and am starting to push people away, which is why I'm getting it removed.
23	2154	Adverse effects: I've been losing a lot of hair, my appetite has been jacked up off and on, have been more anxious, easily angered, some things make me more sad/upset than usual (I typically do not cry, get too emotional or feel very empathetic), I've been getting mild headaches (I generally never get headaches), and overall I've been having internal wars to control my emotions.
23	2155	I have severe headaches and nothing helps.
23	2156	At the beginning, I have mood swings and headaches, Yes my bleeding was irregular, But I was advised to head of time to be patient for things to settle.
23	2157	I previously had the Mirena, LOVED IT, but it started poking my boyfriend while doing the hibbity-dibbity and after 3 years I developed debilitating headaches.
23	2158	I have the implant and we'll I hate it , I have periods that are all over the place I will be on for a month , I also feel like a baby  is moving in my stomach,  breast tenderness badly to the point I can't take my bra off without being in tears,  I also have bad headaches and have gained weight I get spots on a regular basis now and have period pain that's so bad it feels like I'm in labour I don't know what to do someone help.
23	2159	I also got really bad headaches at first.
23	2160	I also have the worst headaches and sleeplessness.
23	2161	About a week after I had it put in I have been getting headaches, I break out on my face and very bad mood swings I have turned into a total b*tch and get upset very easy and that is not me at all and not to mention I usually have my period 4/5 days it's now going on 10 days, also the implant has moved to the injection point in my arm not sure if that's good or not but I don't like it so I'm getting it taken out next week.
23	2162	I have not gained weight or gotten headaches at all.
23	2163	Well I got this implant after I have my daughter in October 2014 this implant has been very good but sometimes it makes me nauseated and I get really bad headaches and I get dizzy.
23	2164	Horrible headaches.
23	2165	Also am noticing headaches and breakouts more than usual.
23	2166	No mood swings, no headaches.
23	2167	I have noticed I've been getting headaches more often and my skin has the occasional breakout.
23	2168	But short after I started to get headaches everyday and bad ringing in my ears.
23	2169	Constant headaches,kept me in an agitated mood.
23	2170	I have bad headaches and horrible mood swings.
23	2171	I have also been getting headaches that last DAYS, and do not go away with the help of Ibuprofen, 1000 mg does nothing to help.
23	2172	I normally wouldn't care so much about the bleeding, but it's the stiff neck, headaches and frustration from that I can't handle.
23	2173	Aside from that, I get awful headaches, NO sex drive, moody all the time, no energy, I'm thinking I'm headed towards depression, I'm waiting on my insurance to get approval to get this thing out!
23	2174	I get massive headaches and I also get dizzy out of no where.
23	2175	I've had this birth control for about 5 months now I have gained weight, also have bad temper, mood swings ,always tired, headaches, depression but no period.
23	2176	I do have a suspicion that this has made me more susceptible to headaches, but they are very infrequent and manageable.
23	2177	I have gained 20lbs, I haven't had a period since my daughter was born last July (2014) and I get headaches everyday , depressed moods and get angry very quickly, which is unlike me.
23	2178	Then I started to have headaches, nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite, and significant hair loss.
23	2179	I like it.. ok, for the first 4 months my bleeding was non stop and horrible headaches but I went to my doctor and she wrote me a prescription and told me to take the birth control pill also for 1 month straight to control the bleeding and it worked..
23	2180	The only downside to Nexplanon for me is the fact that I would get headaches lasting for two days.
23	2181	I was so hormonal and had constant headaches and I gained 27 lbs WITHOUT a diet change, I tried exercising more than normal and I continued to gain weight.
23	2182	But the past year I've had the most awful headaches .
23	2183	CONSTANT nausea every day, horrible headaches that bc powders can't even help, I haven't noticed any weight gain yet however I literally feel so sick to my stomach that it makes my appetite go crazy and I want to eat everything and once I eat, not even an hour later is my tummy feeling empty and nauseous again.
23	2184	Less headaches.
23	2185	I have been more energetic, have had no headaches or pain whatsoever!
23	2186	I have had heavy bleeding for the past year, headaches, nausea, weight gain.
23	2187	I've always struggled with anxiety and depression but it's worse with this birth control.. My headaches take half of the infirmary to attempt to get rid of them.
23	2188	(Then again I have a fairly light complexion) The week after I had constant headaches (I almost never get headaches) and frequent break outs, and mood swings especially with the implant and my period combined.
23	2189	But it's been almost 3 weeks and I no longer have headaches or break outs other then I normally used to have.
23	2190	One or two intense headaches but Advil can fix that.
23	2191	I've had extreme headaches and tiredness.
23	2192	I had bad headaches and my breast hurt all the time.
23	2193	My only issues are with occasional nausea, increased appetite and weight gain and horrible headaches.
23	2194	No babies....No periods..... but the headaches can be overwhelming...
23	2195	I only get headaches and I haven't had a period but other then that it's all good.
23	2196	Best birth control ever I've use it for since Jan 2013 and I've not gain weight, no headaches or nothing different from my normal life except that I haven't had a period ever since I got it which my Gyno said it was normal when I first got it didn't hurt a bit and I went on a cruise a week after that's how quick it heal but I guess everyone is different.
23	2197	After Nexplanon I had non stop bleeding, severe headaches, severe dizziness, severe lightheadedness, extreme fatigue and severe mood swings.
23	2198	Only side effect I have had is my headaches have become stronger than when I didn't have it in.
23	2199	I have had mine in a little over 3 months now and I have no had ache, headaches or periods.
23	2200	I had mood swings, very low sex drive, and headaches all the time.
23	2201	My periods are not crazy, no awful pains, no headaches, no weight gain.
23	2202	I've had headaches, nausea, hives, nasal sinus issues, depression, mood swings, weight gain, loss of appetite, peeling skin on my face, dandruff, rash on my arm, constantly itching, loss of sex drive, tiredness and the list continues.
23	2203	No headaches, weight gain, bloating...
23	2204	Insertion left a bruise and the first week was difficult with headaches as my body sorted out the hormones.
23	2205	However, I get migraine headaches that last the entire day, I'm very moody/emotional, it made depression so much worse, the implant site hurts all the time, I bleed whenever I get aroused, and I hate having the rod inside me.
23	2206	My ovaries hurt, my breasts hurt, I have gained about 15 pounds in 2 months, constant headaches and absolutely no sex drive, even cuddling and knowing what he wants next is dreadful.
23	2207	I get headaches at times, and pretty emotional most of the time.
23	2208	Yes the 1st six months I would get headaches and was really moody.
23	2209	Had very few side effects: one I really notice is headaches, otherwise nothing.
23	2210	I have bad headaches, gained 10 pounds, and I am feelings super depressed and tired.
23	2211	I have had no side effects apart from occasional sore throat, 2 headaches, occasional muscle pain, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome symptoms (cured with pro biotic drinks!)
23	2212	Only side effects for me are occasional headaches, more spots (solved by daily facewash), dry throat, appetite, and similar to Irritable Bowel Syndrome symptoms but all solved by boosting blood sugar.
23	2213	The headaches are out of this world.
23	2214	Cons: gave me headaches.
23	2215	I tried pills, Nuvaring, Intrauterine devices, Depo Provera shots, but all of those gave me side effects...mainly weight gain, headaches, feeling sluggish, slipping out of place, inconvenience, etc.
23	2216	No headaches, no weight gain, no nothing!
23	2217	The first 4 months I experienced extreme drowsiness and occasional headaches.
23	2218	The irregular bleeding is the worst, headaches and facial breakouts are some other side effects I've experienced.
23	2219	I have some weight gain, a lot of mood swings, headaches every now & then, & sometimes my arm hurts around the insertion area.
23	2220	What I would say is the most annoying is that around the time I should get my period I'm very annoyed and have pretty bad headaches and my arm itches like crazy where the rod is inserted other than that I've had no complaints.
23	2221	No mood swings,  no headaches.
23	2222	I have not had a period since the insertion no weight gain, mood swings,  headaches etc.
23	2223	They made me nauseous, gave me headaches, and made me super hungry (I basically didn't feel like myself at all) I decided to go on Nexplanon and I am SO glad that I did!
23	2224	I have headaches all the time.
23	2225	I got headaches for the first month and no period for two months.
23	2226	Slight headaches occasionally, irritable occasionally too.
23	2227	It just needs time, mine was awful at the start, headaches and stomachache and arm pain and bleeding but 3 months later I have nothing at all.
23	2228	1) Huge weight Gain Like 20-30Lbs 2) Lots of headaches.
23	2229	Not pregnant yet, no weight gain, however I have had an unusual peak in headaches, but nothing horrible.
23	2230	I have read reports or headaches and depression but I haven't had that either.. No weight gain either, I've actually lost 2 lbs since I've been on it.
23	2231	Right away I had terrible headaches that lasted about a week.
23	2232	Thought it was great at first no period not having to worry about contraception, then started to struggle with my weight found it hard to control it constantly feeling hungry, more headaches than usual, spots on face and always feeling down.
23	2233	I'm a runner and 2 months after insertion, I began experiencing headaches after a workout.
23	2234	I don't like taking pills, because they cause headaches.
23	2235	Once your body starts to change physically and mentally, sharp pains up and down your arm, worsen migraine, weight gain, bloating, always annoyed everyday and DEPRESSION EXTREMELY BAD
23	2236	It works in some women's bodies, but during my 3 weeks of use, I fainted twice, had a migraine for 3 straight weeks, vomited sporadically, and had extreme mood swings.
23	2237	3rd day into my nexplenon birth control method and have severe migraines since the day it was inserted I have taken all kinds of pills and won't budge I'm a migraine sufferer so I pretty much know what to do to keep controlled severe eye pain feels like my head is heavy and pounding throbbing pain I can't get out of bed I will take it out ASAP I've tried depo and pills and never had side effects this severe.
23	2238	I get a migraine every week.
23	2239	The first couple of months I had a killer migraine nearly every day they eventually stopped.
23	2240	I've had a constant migraine, dizziness, blurry eyes, etc for a week and a half straight.
23	2241	I got the implant after finding out birth control pills were the cause of my migraine attacks.
23	2242	Some days I'm having a migraine, and my body goes numb or tingles  it's not just my hands that fall asleep it's my feet and legs too.
23	2243	I've always had migraine with aura so my birth control selection was limited to progesterone only along with non-hormonal options.
23	2244	I have chronic migraine and my hormonal triggers are gone (too bad the other ones still exist).
23	2245	I was hospitalized because I thought I was having a stroke turns out it was a severe complex migraine caused by the hormones.
23	2246	I have had to take more migraine meds these past 3 months than I have in my lifetime (I'm 28).
23	2247	However, a day after insertion, I began to have shooting pains up from the site through my shoulder and neck along with a KILLER migraine.
23	2248	I was SO uncomfortable and could not function because of the continuous migraine (it would not respond to any pain reliever).
23	2249	The hormones most likely caused the 5 day long migraine, so I will NOT be having it put back in.
23	2250	I cannot take estrogen birth control because of migraine issues, and so progestin only was the option for me.
23	2251	I absolutly do not recomend this to anyone I got my implant August 29 2016 and a month later had chronic migraines and loss of vision.
23	2252	Everyday, I have gotten migraines that are crippling.
23	2253	I have had about 2 more migraines than usual (I suffer from migraines.)
23	2254	First off I got it inserted, and the first week I had splitting migraines from it.
23	2255	I haven't had any migraines, no weight gain, no pain, nothing.
23	2256	I have mild migraines but that is just a small price to pay.
23	2257	To start: I have menstrual migraines because I create too much estrogen.
23	2258	Massive multiple times a week migraines, rapid weight gain (50lbs in 14 months), major mood swings and anxiety, random chest pain, random gushes of blood which makes me think I'm having a cycle then it just stop, it has zapped all my energy..
23	2259	I really have no complaints with the period thing, but now I always have severe migraines, sudden nausea, breast pain, almost no desire to be intimate and my mood swings are unpredictable and just as bad.
23	2260	Unfortunately, I can't be put on anything aside from the implants or shots due to the migraines I receive.
23	2261	I get frequent migraines, I am having problems fighting depression and major anxiety.
23	2262	Within a day of getting it implanted I started having really bad side effects such as: depression, extreme anxiety, depth perception issues, nausea, food cravings and also felt nauseous towards foods I enjoyed, none stop bleeding, fever, migraines but the worst side effect of all were hives (looks identical to a rash).
23	2263	In these three weeks I have had unbearable migraines I've had to call off of work or leave early several times, I haven't had a period in six years but I definitely got one this week and it has been a living hell.
23	2264	I cried more during those 3 weeks than I have in the last three years simply from being in such bad pain from the migraines and from being more emotionally sensitive than I have ever been.
23	2265	I had it in for a little over six months and I bled the entire time, I cramped, I got migraines, so I took it out.
23	2266	It was fine at first no periods only major migraines.
23	2267	It's made my migraines less severe, my periods are much lighter; but occasionally longer.
23	2268	I've also had migraines pretty bad for 5+ years that Only last for about 10 hours at most.
23	2269	The only downside is my period,so far is lasting way longer than it used to, but it's super light , also I get the worst migraines I've ever had in my life.
23	2270	I'm always nauseous, my migraines have gotten worse, my depression has gotten way out of control where I have been off work since September 25th had to find a therapist a pyschiatrist and I ended up in a mother and baby outpatient program at pine rest for 2weeks...for the past 3 weeks I've been puking at least once or twice a week...I called my drs and I'm getting it taken out on December 2nd 2016.
23	2271	After 4-5 months I started having migraines with auras, weight gain, always tired.
23	2272	I've always suffered from migraines this just makes me have them more often.
23	2273	I began having severe migraines with vision problems and major anxiety.
23	2274	The migraines were so awful that I was in the ER twice to receive a shot to stop the pain.
23	2275	I've also experienced insomnia, loss of appetite, migraines, mood swings, and in the last year I have had 4 yeast infections and once when I had a bacterial infection and yeast infection and the same time.. my doctor was very confused as to how that happened... maybe my body is just not meshing well with this implant, but just about every side effect that can occur with this implant I have had.
23	2276	I get migraines, gained about 10 pounds, and super moody.
23	2277	Everything was fine for the first week and a half then I started getting migraines.
23	2278	I've never been on birth control and I have migraines with aura, so I was a bit limited to Mirena or Nexplanon since I wasn't about the pill life.
23	2279	And my migraines have been much less frequent and less intense since getting Nexplanon.
23	2280	I've constantly been having migraines and feeling so unwell!
23	2281	I've had massive migraines, I've had either a yeast infection or a bacterial infection back to back no matter how many times I've gotten them treated they come right back.
23	2282	I have had it for 4 months and not one day has gone by that I didn't have excruciating migraines ALL DAY, EVERYDAY!!!
23	2283	I would sweat even if I barely did anything that day, extreme migraines and it worsened my depression and anxiety to the point I could not sleep and had no energy.
23	2284	I'll start with a little background saying I was suggested this by my doctor after having a history of migraines with aura and gaining 30 lbs on the pill.
23	2285	I have some migraines and gained a few pounds.
23	2286	I was on the pill for about 5 years but the estrogen give me migraines.
23	2287	Then I started getting bad migraines that won't go away.
23	2288	I was extremely nervous to try Nexplanon because I was suicidal, very depressed, obese, and have history with migraines.
23	2289	Major migraines!
23	2290	I got migraines about 3 or 4 times a week and fever blisters regularly (a few a month).
23	2291	Sometime it can last almost 6 weeks and gives me extremely bad migraines.
23	2292	I had this birth control put in a few months ago and since then I have suffered from at least 6 severe migraines.
23	2293	I have had numbing migraines every day since implantation though and my postpartum depression meds are failing and I have no emotion most days and feel better just sleeping all day and add no sex drive either.
23	2294	I was diagnosed with severe chronic migraines because of my period well one way to stop it was taking this bc, and not getting pregnant.
23	2295	When i first started i have terrible migraines but that went away after 3 months.
23	2296	After several tests it was concluded that the hormones from the implant were causing complex migraines.
23	2297	I don't know why I was not asked if I am prone to migraines, because it would've saved me a lot of trouble.
23	2298	No one expressed concern about migraines like they should have with me.
23	2299	If you are prone to migraines, I highly recommend you do NOT have the implant.
23	2300	I have severe migraines, morning sickness every now & again, & am now getting rashes on the arm that it is inserted in.
23	2301	Bleeding on and off alot and have extreme nausea and migraines with it.
23	2302	About two weeks after the insertion I begin having myoclonic jerking (involuntary movements) and severe migraines.
23	2303	The next day my migraines and the myoclonic jerking abruptly stopped.
23	2304	My migraines have also decreased in frequency (the pill caused an increase!
23	2305	I get very terrible migraines with aura.
23	2306	Acne has been a problem , so have migraines.
23	2307	Its been almost a year now and the side effects are horrific I've had weight gain, real bad mood swings, hair lose, migraines , dizziness , blurred vision,black outs, pain in my arm, bad twitches, insomnia, rls (restless leg syndrome) and now they are refusing to remove it due to inability to pay and no insurance.
23	2308	I have very few birth control options because i get bad aura migraines that are made worse by any BC that has progesterone.
23	2309	Nexplanon was my last resort before an IUD but now i have no other options seeing as how depo made me an overweight lunatic, the patch gave my blinding daily migraines.
23	2310	The only symptoms I got was feeling fatigued and migraines.
23	2311	I always have migraines.
23	2312	I got the Nexplanon inserted in February a few days later I started having migraines daily that Excedrin can't cure.
23	2313	No mood swings, barely a period in September nor October, no migraines.
23	2314	Along with constant migraines.
23	2315	I broke out in hives I had migraines that lasted all day I was dizzy by Saturday my blood pressure was so high I almost had a heart attack I have no history of surgeries or heart attacks yet there I was in the ER.
23	2316	I was terrified to get this, but made the decision after I could no longer stand being on my birth control pills anymore due to severe migraines and upper lip pigmentation!
23	2317	I have been on birth control since I was 10 because of chronic migraines.
23	2318	I am not sleepy and I do not have my migraines anymore.
23	2319	I have had few side effects, I don't have dangerous periods anymore, and I have a lot fewer migraines.
23	2320	I used to get awful monthly PMS migraines and I do not anymore.
23	2321	I cried over everything, had migraines.
23	2322	I got this 4 weeks after my daughter was born and since I've had it my depression has hit the fan, I've got uncontrollable migraines.
23	2323	I sometimes experience horrible migraines and I'm constantly tired and extremely moody.
23	2324	My sex drive?
23	2325	I’m almost always in a bad mood and have NO sex drive.
23	2326	Zero sex drive at all
23	2327	I never had a period again, no camping, mood levelled out and sex drive went up.
23	2328	I had insane mood swings and no sex drive at all.
23	2329	I bled about 20 days of the month, had zero sex drive, increased depression which I had originally associated with PPD  (not the case), and it made sex super painful!
23	2330	I have had ZERO sex drive for the last year and I feeling of dizziness a couple of times a day.
23	2331	The real side effects that caused me to grow tired of this method are, was the fact that I had an extremely low sex drive.
23	2332	I had my period regularly but these past 5 months have been horrible, fatigue is my biggest concern on top of that side effects came in like sweating and no sex drive, huge mood swings, I can't wait to get it out!
23	2333	Plus had weight gain in belly, and dryness and no sex drive.
23	2334	Had 3 implanon implants and currently have nexplanon in, I loved the implanon, no real side effects, regular periods and I managed to lose 4 st whilst on them, but the nexplanon is another matter, brain fog, hair thinning, anxiety, depression, non existent sex drive, I can't even bear for my husband to touch me, sore boobs to the point that it makes me cry, now weight gain, since I had it put in in May 16 I have gained 2.5 stone, I have an active job and eat healthily, no matter what I do my weight keeps jumping up at 7lb at a time and I cannot shift it, I cannot wait to get it out, please ladies do not have this implant!!
23	2335	Another side effect is having the sensation of pins and needles down my arm into my hand (still experiencing) and zero sex drive.
23	2336	I don't have much of a sex drive though and I also have experienced dryness.
23	2337	The irritation is itchy and inflammed and my sex drive is gone and I have dizzy spells and mood swings.
23	2338	I was very worried about the reviews which talked about feeling down and a lowered sex drive but fortunately this hasn't been the case with me.
23	2339	Acne, no sex drive, mood swings, fatigue.
23	2340	My roommate had the same issue, no sex drive etc.
23	2341	Extremely low sex drive.
23	2342	In fact my sex drive is nonexistent but I'm gonna say thats not related since it started to decrease before getting it.
23	2343	The second week I lost my appetite, sex drive, 10 pounds, and experienced mood swings and sadness.
23	2344	I have lost over 1/4 of my hair, my nipples feel like they are going to explode, my sex drive is non existent, and I feel extremely fatigued and tired all of the time!
23	2345	I do get annoyed a little more easily, not much of a sex drive either.
23	2346	My sex drive plummeted, I had 2-3 periods every month, I always feel tired/foggy and I've never had a huge problem with anxiety or depression however about 6 months after having the implant my mood swings were horrible and with the combo of no sex drive and my psychotic rampages my relationship with my husband started to go in a downwards spiral.
23	2347	I've noticed an increase in hunger and sex drive.
23	2348	My biggest problem with this birth control is I have absolutely no sex drive.
23	2349	And no sex drive
23	2350	Additionally, I'm 23 years old and my sex drive has been non existent for the past year.
23	2351	My energy is up again and my sex drive as well.
23	2352	I got suicidal, depressed, panic attacks and NO sex drive.
23	2353	I had Nexplanon in now for 4 1/2 years, the first three were great, absolutely no bleeding, no weight gain, no spots, slight reduction in sex drive, but I couldn't sing its praises enough!
23	2354	I have bad hair loss, boobs are so swollen and sore and sex drive is a big fat zero!
23	2355	I will say though that it's basically killed my sex drive.
23	2356	Also have had very little sex drive, around 15lbs of weight loss, almost no break outs.
23	2357	I have no sex drive, feel like I am pregnant, nausea, vomiting, swelling breast, and contractions.
23	2358	My sex drive (which was relatively high before) has been crazy high, which my fiancée loves, and I don't mind either haha.
23	2359	I recently had Nexplanon removed and immediately experienced mood swings and drop in my sex drive.
23	2360	I had the IUD before beginning nexplanon, the IUD was the worst, it pinched inside and it stole my sex drive beware!!
23	2361	Also I have no sex drive.
23	2362	I've also gained about 20 pounds since I've had it put in and I can't seem to lose it and I've had a huge loss of sex drive, I'm single and with all the bleeding and extra weight I don't even want to have sex with anyone so I find it pointless now.
23	2363	Naturally, I suffer from my hormones: grumpiness, sex drive and appetite are erratic, hated it.
23	2364	It even stopped my sex drive because I am so self conscious because I just keep bleeding.
23	2365	My sex drive if anything has definitely doubled.
23	2366	Also my sex drive feels down which is really unfortunate for my partner and I.
23	2367	My sex drive is still the same and I feel like myself.
23	2368	Sex drive is non existent.
23	2369	No consistent bleeding, no depression, no mood swings and no loss of sex drive.
23	2370	I have next to no sex drive at all which has put a little strain on my relationship as we have probably had sex 5 times in the last 7 months.
23	2371	I have gained 10 lbs so far, no sex drive & I am depressed normally all of the time.
23	2372	For the first 2 years, I had little/no sex drive.
23	2373	I am a sensitive and emotional person by nature, but for the first 2-3 months I was on this I was extremely hormonal and moody and almost no sex drive.
23	2374	Also the my sex drive is still lower than normal but has come back and levelled out as well.I was considering getting it taken out before my moods and sex drive returned closer to normal.
23	2375	I have absolutely no sex drive what so ever.
23	2376	I am 27, Before this I had the HIGHEST sex drive EVER!!
23	2377	I'm a young adult and I had a super high sex drive before I got this implant.
23	2378	It actually has gotten my sex drive up.
23	2379	The only thing I have noticed is my sex drive is lower than it used to be, but that could be due to my anxiety.
23	2380	My sex drive is sometimes effected, but no weight gain.
23	2381	I have zero sex drive as well because I am always so tired and just not in the mood.
23	2382	I can say I am still bittersweet with this birth control my sex drive is almost non existent, and my mood as hit an all time low.
23	2383	I have terrible mood swings, I get angry very easily, and I also have a very low sex drive, so my relationship is suffering.
23	2384	And I've literally had zero sex drive the past 9 months.
23	2385	I've gained over 50lbs, my sex drive was up & down, I never stopped my period they just became lighter, my mood swings were awful.
23	2386	Very moody depression kicks in, mad all the time at my bf, periods come whenever they want too, very emotional, haven't seen weight gain, no sex drive at all.
23	2387	I haven't lost sex drive.
23	2388	I have no sex drive what so ever and I have gain 50 pounds.
23	2389	I have completely lost my sex drive, it doesn't even appeal to me, my depression and anxiety is worse, and now I have horrible insomnia.
23	2390	Slight mood changes but that's with any BC, skin has changed (occasional breakouts my entire life), still have a sex drive, and no weight gain.
23	2391	I also experienced fatigue, low sex drive, and depression.
23	2392	I've had nexplonon for a year and I'm honestly not a fan I have horrible mood swings sex drive is extremely low.
23	2393	It's effective in no getting pregnant but my experience has been horrible I have a 7 month old and got this at the postpregnancy checkup ..It was okay at first...then I started to bleed it was light but changed and I as on my period for almost 3 months straight it stopped finally but then would start again very irregular ...it might be regulating but I get my period and it lasts almost a week and half on Christmas then gone but came back extremly heavy a couple of days into new years..on top of that I've been tired no sex drive and depression.
23	2394	It's doing it's job but so is the no sex drive.
23	2395	It has killed my sex drive to the point I don't do a whole lot of sexual stuff or even think of sex at all.
23	2396	I been on it for a month and so far I have had no major side affects and I like it haven't have a period yet and like it but haven't had much of a sex drive other than that love it
23	2397	My sex drive is better than ever.
23	2398	No change in sex drive.
23	2399	However, I haven't had a period for two years, I have no sex drive at all, and I've gained 50+ pounds( but I have a slow metabolism to begin with) other than that, no problems at all.
23	2400	I tried many different pills before this and with all of them I had irregular bleeding, mood swings, low sex drive, etc.
23	2401	I feel awful about my self, have zero sex drive, and am going up a pants size every week.
23	2402	And my sex drive is much lower after getting it inserted.
23	2403	The reason why I am giving this three points is because Nexplanon  did prevent me from getting pregnant but at what cost ?I also have 0 Sex Drive
23	2404	I have no sex drive what so ever.
23	2405	My sex drive decreased, but not too badly.
23	2406	My sex drive has decreased to zero.
23	2407	I've been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years and lack of sex drive and mood swings are hurting our relationship.
23	2408	I also have no sex drive whatsoever, have been super emotional, and have become depressive at work, not caring enough to do what I need to do.
23	2409	Now, I could care less if we have sex, we need to use lube, sex drive is gone.
23	2410	Experienced loss of appetite for a few days, lower sex drive but normal now, and minor mood swings.
23	2411	It totally killed my sex drive on top of making me bleed like a stuck pig.
23	2412	I gained almost 20 pounds and I have not had a sex drive
23	2413	I was bleeding non-stop and felt horrible the whole time, so no sex drive at all.
23	2414	The problem I have is that I have no sex drive and I have become very depressed.
23	2415	I have no sex drive and I have vaginal dryness which makes sex painful.
23	2416	It kills your sex drive, makes you feel like you're going insane.
23	2417	I didn't really have any complaints however,a few short months I started getting my period for 2-3 weeks at a time and didn't have much of a sex drive ( my husband was the only one who had a problem with that) after my 3 years I decided that I would just get another one inserted after much research into other birth controls I just seen this one to be fit.
23	2418	I have seen a significant decrease in my sex drive.
23	2419	I've noticed that it also decreased my sex drive.
23	2420	I gained 15+ pounds in 5 months, crazy mood  swings and very anxious all the time, Zero sex drive.
23	2421	So I had the nexplanon in for 7 months now.Im considering taking it out only because of the bleeding ,fatigue,head fogs,dizziness,depression,weight lost,Low sex drive,Vagina dryness,Vagina odor,Forgetfulness  etc.
23	2422	Sex drive non existent.
23	2423	I haven't had mood swings, weight gain or a decrease in sex drive.
23	2424	I have no sex drive.
23	2425	My sex drive haven't decreased and my man feels free to finish inside of me and we've NO pregnancy scares!
23	2426	It was great from 18 months or so with no bleeding but noticed lack of sex drive, mood swings, and extreme exhaustion with no ability to sleep at night.
23	2427	My sex drive is so low, and I'm extremely hormonal.
23	2428	I am actually thinner than I was pre pregnancy, the best sex drive I've ever had & no mood issues.
23	2429	Also, I previously took a few different kinds of birth control pills & always ended up with a low sex drive & depression.
23	2430	No decrease in sex drive.
23	2431	I've been on the Apri pill for two years and during that time I had extremely low sex drive, horrible anxiety and dissociation, and had chronic yeast/bacterial infections.
23	2432	Before it was both emotionally and physically difficult for me to have sex with my boyfriend, now my sex drive has increased 10 fold and I can easily have sex whenever I want to.
23	2433	I have however noticed about a month ago now a huge decrease in my sex drive.
23	2434	Got this BC in July, since then I've non stop bleeding, literally, NON STOP, zero sex drive, I've gained 35 pounds and NOTHING takes it off, I haven't weighed this much since I was pregnant!
23	2435	My moods were normal and sex drive.
23	2436	I've had nexplanon for 1 year and have had no sex drive, terrible anxiety attacks, and have gained about 15 pounds.
23	2437	I have no sex drive and get mad at my husband when he wants it.
23	2438	And that sucked because it did not drop my sex drive, just the ability to have it.
23	2439	I have 0 sex drive (thank god because I bleed too much to have sex anyway) and have gained a noticable amount of weight.
23	2440	I have gained 15 lbs, lost sex drive, hot flashes and depression.
23	2441	Sex drive is totally down too- never in the mood.
23	2442	I have gained about 30 pounds, I have extreme mood swings, my weight gain has made me depressed, and my sex drive is at an all time low.
23	2443	I had a constant period for the first 10 months, and after that, very irregular cycles (sometimes with adverse PMS mood swings and no period to follow), anxious and depressive episodes, and no sex drive.
23	2444	But I definitely had a decreased sex drive, I didn't even let my boyfriend touch me because it just seemed off putting.
23	2445	My sex drive is definitely still there and I've lost 6.5 lbs since then.
23	2446	Plus it's caused me to be short tempered and made my sex drive go down a lot.
23	2447	I've had a huge increase in my sex drive, which seems to be rare.
23	2448	I felt nauseous, for a period every other week, felt like I was on a never ended cycle, had the worse mood swings, I'm usually not the nicest but I could not handle being that irritable and completely lost my sex drive.
23	2449	After a day or two my sex drive returned.
23	2450	My sex drive is gone and it's making my life horrible!
23	2451	Low sex drive and fatigued that's all.
23	2452	NO SEX DRIVE, Moody and grumpy all the time.
23	2453	I have no sex drive at all and thought that was because of having a new baby, but 5.5 months in and I still hate it.
23	2454	I spent a lot of money on pads since I was constantly bleeding and sex drive went down because of it.
23	2455	Bloating, mood swings, couldn't concentrate, no sex drive what so ever.
23	2456	Second weight gain and bloating I have only gained about 5 lbs but I can't lose it and I feel bloated EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY my mood swings are out the door and my sex drive is terrible I feel bad for my bf and am getting this thing out asap
23	2457	No sex drive and I either want to cry my eyes out or feel like I have no heart because I can't cry!
23	2458	I have zero sex drive.
23	2459	My sex drive does not exist like I really had to sit down a few days ago and think about what was wrong with me and the birth control is the only difference I have made since then.
23	2460	I have had severe anxiety which has led me to lost weight and any sex drive I had before.
23	2461	I started gaining weight, tired all the time, and my sex drive is almost non existent!
23	2462	They are right about not getting pregnant on it because your bleeding damn near the whole time and your sex drive is out of whack along with mood swings from not getting any lol
23	2463	My sex drive is down I am depressed, severe mood swings, really bad anxiety, fatigue back pain unable to sleep pretty much all the negative side effects that you can get I have
23	2464	I've been constantly exhausted, have gained 10 lbs, and have no sex drive whatsoever.
23	2465	My sex drive has increased since I've been on it, overall I give this birth control a 8/10 but that's only because my period was messed with
23	2466	My sex drive is fine and I haven't gained any weight from it (so far) and I haven't had problems with being tired all the time.
23	2467	Hasn't effected my sex drive at some points it seemed like it but nope having more sex then before I got it in
23	2468	But anyway had no problems with sex drive, I do have energy, and I admit I gain 5lbs but not sure if that's because of the implant or just me who does not like to exercise.
23	2469	I didn't think it affected my sex drive but my fianc
23	2470	I have little to no sex drive.
23	2471	I had this end for a year now an I ready to take it out when I first got it I was on my period for 2 months very heavy an my sex drive was so low always dizzy an out of breath  heaviness an the chest.
23	2472	I've been on this for 10 months and I haven't had my period since month three, this did not lower my sex drive or make me gain weight.
23	2473	My sex drive was extremely low, and still is.
23	2474	My sex drive didn't change and I haven't gained any weight on it.
23	2475	Headaches every day, frequent yeast infections, no sex drive at all.
23	2476	Biggest bummer is low sex drive.
23	2477	Still have my sex drive lol .
23	2478	And lower sex drive.
23	2479	My sex drive dipped for a long time and it only finally started to come back recently.
23	2480	But no problems with pain, bleeding, or sex drive.
23	2481	I have lost my sex drive.
23	2482	My sex drive has come back surprisingly but everything is still the same.
23	2483	I also lost my sex drive which negated its purpose.
23	2484	I have absolutely no sex drive which sucks.
23	2485	The first year it made me moody, depressed, and my sex drive plummeted!
23	2486	So my moods, depression and sex drive have gotten better but I can't have sex as much now because my cycle is running too long.
23	2487	I recently got the implant removed because this form of birth control kills your sex drive and seriously who wants to be on their period for weeks at a time.
23	2488	Sex drive hasn't changed.
23	2489	I also have no energy, have developed anemia and my sex drive got so low that I actually developed an aversion to sex.
23	2490	Although I have sex with my bf frequently but I admit I have lost most of my sex drive .
23	2491	My sex drive has all but disappeared and I've gained almost 15 pounds.
23	2492	No sex drive at all what so ever....definitely moody, and constantly bleeding....I thought this would be a good birth control because I can't remember to take the pills but let's just say getting in out in a week.
23	2493	I have been on this BC for 4 months and I have not gotten pregnant, lost my sex drive or gained weight from it.
23	2494	I had some weight gain and no sex drive because I was constantly on my period.
23	2495	SECOND- was bleeding every so often, hairloss, appetite change, hardly any sex drive, moodiness.
23	2496	NOW - I'm very irritable, still losing hair, losing weight, no sex drive, can't sleep much at all, basically losing faith!
23	2497	I've had really bad side affects but my sex drive has gone up.
23	2498	NO sex drive.
23	2499	I have had 0 sex drive since I got this thing put in.
23	2500	Sex doesn't cause bleeding for me, and I've always been on bc so my sex drive was always low for me but I try to get in the mood.
23	2501	My sex drive has been a little low (I think because there's no ovulation with this form of BC), but other than that it's been amazing.
23	2502	I am tired even if I sleep all night and half the day, I have ZERO sex drive and the majority of the time I'm in a bad mood.
23	2503	Not only was the weight a big downside, but I was so moody all the time and lost my sex drive.
23	2504	I have had no sex drive ever since and I wouldn't be able to have sex anyway because I'm bleeding as if I've been on my period for weeks
23	2505	THE WORST side effect thus far has been my sex drive.
23	2506	I have also noticed a rapid decrease in sex drive and in the last 6 months less sensitive and I have a very hard time getting turned on,  which is probably the cause of the lack of sensitivity.
23	2507	I haven't gained weight, lost sex drive, or had a drastic change in moods/emotions.
23	2508	I don't feel as though it has had any effect on my emotions other than my sex drive is lacking, but that could also be from the breast feeding.
23	2509	I'm extremely irritable,  and my sex drive has gone down.
23	2510	But the worst of it all no sex drive completely GONE.
23	2511	My sex drive is completely gone, I'm bloated all the time and am a bit lazier than usual.
23	2512	I have no sex drive, and I used to, and don't seem to find pleasure in things I used to (hobbies etc.)
23	2513	My sex drive is lower than ever.
23	2514	Sex drive and all.
23	2515	One thing that sucks about it is my sex drive, I don't get turned on easily and I'm not  "wet" like I used to.
23	2516	I have no sex drive either at all.
23	2517	My sex drive is much lower.This is my first time being on birth control.
23	2518	My one and only complaint is that my sex drive is very low.
23	2519	And my sex drive has gone way up because of the difference.
23	2520	I'm tired a lot and have no sex drive.
23	2521	I'm thinking about removing it at the end of this year because of the weight gain and the lack of sex drive.
23	2522	It's already bad enough I don't have a sex drive!
23	2523	Horrible for me, I used to use pills so I decided I will try this method it works about no getting pregnant ,I had only a year and its the worst experience, I haven't had a period for a year I'm starting to have problems with my gall bladder, breast pain everyday no sex drive at all and let's not talk about the weight gain almost 20 pounds in one year I will get it out by the end of this year cause I can't take it any more I won't recommend this !
23	2524	Despite the claims regarding lowered sex drive, I've actually experienced a slight increase in my sex drive.
23	2525	it's balanced out my hormones I'm not as crazy with my mood swings I only  bleed twice a year lasting around 4 days I haven't gained weight my sex drive is as good as ever ...and it's no big deal getting it inserted and removed - you're a big girl!
23	2526	I also have a very low sex drive which makes me want to get it removed.
23	2527	Killed my sex drive.
23	2528	I've also noticed that I don't have a sex drive anymore AND IT hurts after intercourse.
23	2529	My sex drive is gone and sex is anywhere from uncomfortable to painful.
23	2530	The deal breaker was the near complete loss of my sex drive, I didn't want the method of birth control to be "have no desire to touch your husband!"
23	2531	The bad news is my sex drive has been reduced to zero, so it's now a waste of time having it because I'm pretty much not having sex anyway and it's starting to affect my relationship quite badly.
23	2532	I had no sex drive and it was pretty useless due to the fact I was always on my period, preventing me from having sex.
23	2533	I lost 20 pounds while on it and my sex drive has gone up.
23	2534	My sex drive is completely gone, which is a huge problem because I'm 19 and in a relationship so it sucks and almost makes me want to get it out early..
23	2535	At about a year, I stopped having periods altogether... but I also lost my sex drive completely.
23	2536	Being married, it is a very big issue to not have a sex drive.
23	2537	I got it removed before the 3 year mark MAINLY because of my loss of sex drive.
23	2538	No loss of sex drive.
23	2539	Since then, my sex drive hasn't changed, my skin is clearer, I've lost weight, i don't have mood swings (but we all have bad days...) , I haven't had a period, and i've never had to remember to take a damn pill!!
23	2540	Low sex drive and that leads to more moodiness.
23	2541	Also the weight I have put on makes me look pregnant.I have been more mellow and my sex drive has drastically lowered.
23	2542	Yes it is great at preventing pregnancy because you loose your entire sex drive.
23	2543	No I did not gain weight, and no I did not lose my sex drive.
23	2544	I have periods that last for months on months, and my sex drive has gone down so much.
23	2545	My sex drive is non existent.
23	2546	However I have lost complete sex drive the urge of any sexual acts.
23	2547	Plus I feel like I'm in a bad mood all the time, I'm tired, & no sex drive.
23	2548	My sex drive decreased a bit.
23	2549	I'm moody and have no sex drive.
23	2550	Everything else is normal, my body feels fine, my sex drive is still high, & I have not gained or lost any weight, nor have I had any unusual mood swings.
23	2551	I can't even tell its inserted in my arm and I still have a very high sex drive.
23	2552	Sex drive is still great with my boyfriend.
23	2553	Which is very annoying since I do still have a sex drive haha.
23	2554	I still have strong sex drive.
23	2555	My sex drive has also gone COMPLETELY.
23	2556	With little to no effort at all I've gained 45lbs, zero sex drive, horrible mood swings with periods of depression.
23	2557	My sex drive is completely gone, I've become more depressed and when I do get my period, they last for a month or longer!
23	2558	Absolutely no sex drive, which is out of character for me and my partner hated.
23	2559	No pregnancy scares & no loss of sex drive.
23	2560	My sex drive is back full force- very light cramping- a bit of nausea after any alcohol.
23	2561	It has not affected my sex drive and everything else is going good.
23	2562	My mood and sex drive were a little off at the beginning but quickly returned back to normal.
23	2563	My period stopped that night and my sex drive has increased.
23	2564	My sex drive doesn't exist.
23	2565	My sex drive is nonexistent.
23	2566	Before that I was happy, high sex drive (always have had high sex drive), regular periods, and overall very long life.
23	2567	I have no sex drive and I feel like my hair/face is always greasy.
23	2568	Being on the Implanon was not that bad, I didn't have a period with it until 5 months before I had it removed, I didn't have weight gain, but it did cause me to not have a sex drive, I was moody, depressed, mad and emotional but it was bearable.
23	2569	Sex drive was completely non-existent for a few months but other than that no pregnancies or serious problems.
23	2570	My sex drive did decline although I can't totally blame that on the Nexplanon.
23	2571	But as for the pregnancy part, me and my boyfriend have unprotected sex alot and no babies - sex drive has not decreased one bit.
23	2572	My sex drive plummeted.
23	2573	My sex drive is down a little and I've put on a few pounds, but it's worth it to have no periods.
23	2574	Also my sex drive has been slowly but surely diminishing.
23	2575	I do seem to have low sex drive sometimes but not frequently.
23	2576	I did have side effects, my major ones are depression, lack of sex drive, and mood swings.
23	2577	At first I felt like I had no sex drive at all, which I didn't know was a side effect, but now my sex drive is back.
23	2578	My sex drive is strong and I'm not pregnant.
23	2579	I actually feel like my sex drive has increased.
23	2580	No mood swings, no strong appetite, GREAT SEX DRIVE.
23	2581	I was, like many, nervous because of all the horror stories I heard about bleeding and moodiness and decreased sex drive, but decided to try it.
23	2582	And I haven't noticed a significant difference in my sex drive, though it has decreased a little - my boyfriend and I have had no problems.
23	2583	Sex drive has decreased noticeably.
23	2584	Also I have little to no sex drive.
23	2585	I've read a lot of reviews of girls saying they lost their sex drive.
23	2586	ZERO sex drive when my husband tries I just laugh.
23	2587	I have absolutely NO sex drive.
23	2588	The only other side effect I've experienced is a total lack of any sex drive whatsoever.
23	2589	I began to bleed constantly and my sex drive basically disappeared.
23	2590	I haven't had sexual intercourse in months because of the prolong period and no sex drive.
23	2591	My sex drive totally left the building and mood swings are crazy.
23	2592	My reasons for switching were weight gain, mood swings, and loss of sex drive.
23	2593	I had depo b4 this an My libido was non existent, and intercourse hurt bad which in why I switched the nexplanon but those side effects didn't get any better either..
23	2594	But the biggest effect I experienced was the complete decline of my libido.
23	2595	Migraines that were crippling for days and excessive amount of weight gain, low self esteem, no libido, I didn't even want my husband around me much less touching me in anyway.
23	2596	I don't feel like I have whiplash from my moods, my libido is back, and my skin is clear again.
23	2597	ZERO libido.
23	2598	My libido is still high but I can't have sex because of the bleeding
23	2599	This has been the worst for my girlfriend.... she constantly gets mood swings and her libido has dramatically decreased to the point where I kiss her sets her unease.
23	2600	I snapped at my family often and the libido was gone.
23	2601	Also I've noticed no libido.
23	2602	My libido is somewhat reduced, which in my case isn't a bad thing.
23	2603	Good news is I haven't gained weight, noticed a change in my libido, or gotten pregnant.
23	2604	I often feel depressed and am extremely moody and I hasn't effected my libido thankfully.
23	2605	During the first two weeks I was very moody and emotional with no libido but that has gone and my body feels it's regular normalcy.
23	2606	I got nexplanon put it last July and I hate the irregular cycles and the decreased libido.
23	2607	They decreased my libido, made me feel sick a lot and pills are just annoying to have to take anyway.
23	2608	I was really worried it would kill my libido, as was my experience with the pill, but it didn't affect it at all, in fact I feel so much more free now I enjoy sex a lot more.
23	2609	The only other major side effects are that my libido has almost completely disappeared and I have gained a bit of weight  I can't seem to shake(although I'm actively working out and dieting).
23	2610	Then I had no period for six months, and my libido disappeared.
23	2611	Great contraception, I lost all my libido and bleeding like a stuck pig isnt too attractive!
23	2612	I'm about 6 months in and I've already gained 12 more pounds, mood swings, low libido, and sever depression.
23	2613	My libido has even gone back to normal.
23	2614	I was also incredibly irritable and depressed on an almost daily basis, which put just as much of a damper on intimacy with my boyfriend as the virtually nonexistent libido that it gave me.
23	2615	Not only has this medicine completely destroyed my libido, it has put a complete strain on my relation due to my refusal for affection.
23	2616	On top of that, I have zero libido...ZERO!
23	2617	I do have close to zero libido which I actually don't mind but obviously may be an issue for others.
23	2618	I am a little worried about the fact that I have zero libido and no desire to be intimate with my husband.
23	2619	But I've had no issues with libido.
23	2620	Plus it was free with my health coverage AND my libido is back.
23	2621	I have zero weight gain and my periods have remained the same since before I got it.
23	2622	I have gone from 130 pounds to 200 pounds and can't shake the weight gain what so ever!
23	2623	No major weight gain.
23	2624	Weight gain, and lack of ability to lose weight was pretty bad.
23	2625	I've also noticed a bit of weight gain but nothing major (might just be me).
23	2626	I use to have it years ago when it was called implanon , and I never had a issue but a bit of weight gain , but my doctor says that only thing changed was the name but this time around I'm having TERRIBLE mood swings , angry most of the time , depressed , and lots of crying .
23	2627	But the incredible mood swings, depression, weight gain, and fatigue are just not worth it.
23	2628	After this little week period I started experiencing weight gain and then the mood swings set in.
23	2629	Haven’t really had any side effect because just a little weight gain but every BC I feel like you gain a little!
23	2630	What I don't like is my weight gain, and my period was just too irregular.
23	2631	Maybe a little weight gain but almost every BC affects your weight
23	2632	I had taken BC in the past where I experienced weight gain & this was no different.
23	2633	Just like any other birth control, this stopped my period with 1 day of light bleeding, some weight gain, I felt a little depressed or lazy so I forced myself to exercise.
23	2634	Today, I just got my Nexplanon removed because of the 80 pound weight gain I had and it was affecting my health.
23	2635	No weight gain till 2 1/2 year later when  I gained 35 pound's.
23	2636	I would definitely say the worst side effect I’ve gotten is the weight gain.
23	2637	Other than that, I'd say the pros out weigh the cons but currently I'm looking into a non-hormonal option just to see if this was truly causing my weight gain
23	2638	I had no weight gain, my hormones seem stable, I haven't had any problems whatsoever.
23	2639	Other side effects included a weight gain of 10 pounds and unexpected mood swings.
23	2640	Again, I was super happy the first year, even with the rapid weight gain.
23	2641	I had no issues with weight gain or weight loss.
23	2642	I’m surely thinking about getting off due to constant pain & constant weight gain.
23	2643	I hate this birth control I have been bleeding for thirty some days and I haven't stopped I feel so sick and the mood swings the weight gain is horrible.
23	2644	It has been very affective in preventing pregnancy but the weight gain has been outrageous.
23	2645	I rarely get my period which is a plus, and it does it's job but the weight gain is miserable.
23	2646	I have weird cravings for foods (some that I did not even like before lol) and have experienced some weight gain but I think it is because of poor food choices.
23	2647	The weight gain and sore breasts are really enough.
23	2648	No weight gain but, I did bleed in some capacity for the entire 11 months I had it.
23	2649	I had nexplanon in since November of last year at first it was going good the then after a month i got head aches and just want to sleep all day but then the weight gain started and depression most of the time.
23	2650	No weight gain, but considering everything else who cares.
23	2651	Weight gain is the only thing I haven't seen too much.
23	2652	I had no periods, mood swings, weight gain, or any generally negative side effects.
23	2653	However, after those first six weeks were up I have experienced/been experiencing weight gain (approx.
23	2654	That is such a rapid weight gain that I now have stretch marks on my hips and thighs!
23	2655	Let's not forget about the dramatic weight gain.
23	2656	I got the implant now over 6 weeks ago and unlike other reviews I've read I haven't had any weight gain or mod swings but my cycle is horrible!!
23	2657	Most these reviews seem pretty negative, but I had little to no period, no weight gain, no emotional distress, and no pregnancy!
23	2658	Oh did I mention rapid weight gain with extreme cravings!
23	2659	Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure it caused all of my weight gain, but I'm not pregnant so there's that.
23	2660	I have became verbally abusive and have low self esteem due to my weight gain... No matter what I did, I couldn't feel secure.
23	2661	I am having slight weight gain but I'm 5'9in so it's not noticeable.
23	2662	I may have had some slight weight gain, but nothing significant all of my clothes still fit.
23	2663	Tiredness and weight gain.
23	2664	I can agree on the weight gain - although I had a sedentary job when I had it in, it's like the weight just creeps up!
23	2665	I got this implanted into my arm exactly two years ago.. my doctor has now recommended me to get this taken out of my arm as soon as possible do to my abnormal weight gain.
23	2666	I had no signs of weight gain, my periods were normal.
23	2667	I'm always feeling depressed and the weight gain really has me even more depressed.
23	2668	Cons about this birth control weight gain, two to three week periods that are very light, horrible mood swings, memory loss, horrible back pain.
23	2669	I have had the weight gain, but that's my fault too cause I suck at exercising.
23	2670	No weight gain or mood swings.
23	2671	I haven't broken out and haven't had crazy weight gain or mood swings its just the constant on my period that is bugging me.
23	2672	However none of my bleeding has been uncomfortable I have not experience weight gain your mood swings.
23	2673	Don't have to remember a pill everyday, haven't experienced any weight gain, maybe a few mood swings just my body adjusting to the hormones going through my body.
23	2674	I experienced bloating and weight gain that was explainable to me (I was not thinking about the birth control) because I have very high metabolism.
23	2675	My only negative points would be horrible weight gain during the duration of having it and the weight was near impossible to lose.
23	2676	I have constant moods swings, extremely irritable, weight gain & bloating, and I have now had a period/spotting for a full month.
23	2677	The Weight gain I've not lost but 9 pounds since giving birth I was 115 prior to birth and now I stay at 155.
23	2678	It has been 3 years, only side affect may be weight gain, unable to say if that's just me getting older (30 now).
23	2679	Only because of the weight gain.
23	2680	Weight gain!
23	2681	After experimenting with various pills and suffering from mood swings, this was the one method that didn't give me mood swings or weight gain.
23	2682	I haven't had any allergic reactions, weight gain, or mood changes.
23	2683	However, it's extremely effective and I didn't have any weight gain or harsh side effects other than a longer period.
23	2684	I noticed some weight gain and mood swings but I thought it was worth it for not getting pregnant.
23	2685	No period, no weight gain, no side effects at all it's been great!
23	2686	Then the weight gain started, I was always a size one, and over the course of a year I jumped to size 5.
23	2687	I was relatively healthy in terms of diet and physical activity and had never experienced significant weight gain prior to the Nuvaring.
23	2688	I selected this birth control specifically for the convenience and I was under the impression that there was really no risk of weight gain.
23	2689	I equated the weight gain to the "freshman 15", but I have been eating 1700 calories a day and working out 7 days a week and the weight keeps piling on.
23	2690	I was excited to start because I saw most reviews said no weight gain and it was the best birth control out there...WRONG.
23	2691	It did cause serious weight gain and apparently during the removal it was embedded into my arm muscle.
23	2692	I'm 21 years old and I have came from the Depo Shot 2 years to the Nexplanon I DO NOT RECOMMEND EITHER ONE especially if you are worried about serious weight gain.
23	2693	I had no weight gain, but experienced very depressed mood and the constant on and off bleeding.
23	2694	The plus side is I do not have a period and have not gotten prego but the weight gain is awful and I was told that it wasn't normal on this to gain a lot of weight.
23	2695	But no weight gain.
23	2696	I didn't realize my steady weight gain though..
23	2697	I did receive a little weight gain, I can be a little moody sometimes and my boobs and tummy get very tender once a month, but although I have the hormonal effect of a monthly period I very rarely (once every 3 months) receive very light bleeding/spotting.
23	2698	After having specifically asked if here was any connection between birth control and weight gain (and being told there is no correlation) I made sure to continue my regular workout routine and I have yet to gain weight.
23	2699	While many people have experienced weight gain I've experienced extreme weight loss.
23	2700	In addition to the very, very long periods, pain everyday, weight gain and fatigue.
23	2701	I did not experience any weight gain or mood swings or bad skin overall good experience.
23	2702	I haven't experienced any weight gain or skin problems.
23	2703	It actually stopped mine and I had no weight gain.
23	2704	Been on it for 3 months, 20 pound weight gain - always hungry and never full.
23	2705	No periods, but not worth the weight gain and uncontrollable appetite...  Was managing weight very well prior to implant...
23	2706	If it weren't for the weight gain I'd get it done again.
23	2707	In terms of weight gain, I have gained about 30lbs back that I lost.
23	2708	, I knew one of the side effects would be weight gain and that was my biggest fear , I went gym 3 times a week and ate healthy , it was only then I realised none of it mattered and that only after 6 months I had put on 2 stone !!!
23	2709	No weight gain or pain no side effects
23	2710	No weight gain.
23	2711	Other than that I have not had any pregnancy scares or other issues such as weight gain or depression.
23	2712	My OB said he wanted to try something different because of my weight gain so I was all for it.
23	2713	I'm scrolling through the reviews of this birth control and I feel as if everyone is really magnifying the weight gain.
23	2714	The weight gain comes from cravings, the same type you have when you're on your period.
23	2715	If it weren't for the weight gain I would stick with it but I'm getting it out tomorrow.
23	2716	I have also experienced significant weight gain and mood shifts.
23	2717	Plus side I haven't had any reasonable weight gain from insert.
23	2718	Mood swings, anxiety out of control, hot flashes and 50 lbs weight gain.
23	2719	But weight gain and water retention is a game changer for me.
23	2720	I have had minor weight gain which I am going to attribute more to my less than active lifestyle, (less than ten pounds).
23	2721	I don't blame nexplanon for weight gain as it is probably due to the simple fact that I don't workout regularly as much as I need to.
23	2722	Also the weight gain is horrible I went from 137 to 160 in a year and I work out everyday eat healthy nothing will make it go down.
23	2723	(Mostly weight gain and depression)
23	2724	I became EXTREMELY emotional, my hair started shedding, WEIGHT GAIN!
23	2725	As I hit my first year mark I began getting pregnancy symptoms so I took a few tests even went to the doctor and I wasn't thankfully but turns out all my side effects (nausea, sensitive smell, weight gain, mood swings, excessive sleeping, and even frequent urination) were due to the nexplanon.
23	2726	It's made me have very bad mood swings and also weight gain.
23	2727	Also because of the weight gain it's hard to feel in my arm.
23	2728	No weight gain or loss.
23	2729	I had this thing the Nexplanon fitted 8/02/2016 February 2016 and first couple of months was fine it stopped the bleeding after a month in March,Then around August 2016 I noticed a massive weight gain without any extreme change in diet exercise, It felt like I was a pregnant lady which (I am not as I  don't like children & never want them hense the implant fitted.)
23	2730	The only part I like is the weight gain because I can actually fit my clothes now.. 6 months will be in February and my doctor says my monthly bleeding will stop.. Hopefully it does because this sucks, really!
23	2731	I've had crazy depression out of no where and weight gain like crazy.
23	2732	But the only con I have, is the weight gain.
23	2733	I've gained at least 25lbs the past year, the first year I did not experience any or much weight gain.
23	2734	the 2nd year on Nexplanon is when I had this drastic weight gain and I've done everything, I've changed my eating habits, regular in gym and I can't lose any weight!
23	2735	I've had trouble sleeping (too much sleeping) weight gain, constantly having "periods" and I've been Extremely moody..
23	2736	The mood swings are just awful, oh and not to mention the weight gain in such a short time.
23	2737	The weight gain is ridiculous gained about 20 pounds.
23	2738	This weight gain is rediculously dramatic.
23	2739	The weight gain...oh lord.
23	2740	I had no weight gain or mood swings.
23	2741	Mood swings were horrible and the weight gain was out of control.
23	2742	Btw- Weight gain is never caused from BC ladies lol.
23	2743	So I had my implant put in May 2014 and the first year and a half was great I felt perfectly fine didn't have weight gain or anything.
23	2744	Second, the weight gain.
23	2745	I have developed health issues due to the weight gain in the past 6months.
23	2746	The weight gain and severe depression are the worst.
23	2747	I was nervous because so many reviews mentioned weight gain, and that's one of my general biggest fears.
23	2748	About three weeks later I got the nexaplon inserted,  I consistently had weight gain month over month, even while breast-feeding.
23	2749	The weight gain since I have had it in was 30 pounds.
23	2750	I love to run and the weight gain has taken a negative toll on it.
23	2751	My skin is the clearest it's been, I haven't had a period since August, my mood swings have gotten SO much better and my weight gain stopped.
23	2752	This is a very effective form of birth control and I also didn't have any periods at all but the weight gain was terrible.
23	2753	The weight gain wasn't as bad as the Depo shot but the mood swings were the same
23	2754	I thought my weight gain was just extra pounds I didn't lose from the baby and I just needed to try harder.
23	2755	I didn't experience any weight gain.
23	2756	The only negative side effects I have experienced are some minor weight gain (although I have experienced weight gain on every birth control I've tried) and considerable breast pain a few days before I start my period.
23	2757	No changes in skin, possibly could have contributed to emotional distresses and weight gain but other things changed in my life too so I can not say definitively that it was the nexplanon.
23	2758	the weight gain is horrible!!
23	2759	I didn't want to go with hormones because of side effects like weight gain.
23	2760	Upper lip hair, mood swings often, depression, some weight gain, fatigue, and occasionally pain at insertion site.
23	2761	My situation now is I refuse to take it off as I didn't experience any weight gain depression or any other weird mood as that is caused my my family.
23	2762	Of course it's effective because I haven't gotten pregnant, but the mood swings and awful weight gain have made me miserable.
23	2763	I was excited about the weight gain since I'm slim and had lost a few pounds but my weight is stable.
23	2764	I haven't noticed any weight gain but I was heavy to start with and my skin is actually BETTER Than before.
23	2765	Have had a bit of weight gain but I couldn't say for sure if it has been from the birth control haha I didn't have any issues with implantation, healing, or the effectiveness so far.
23	2766	The downside to this is I'm almost always on my period, my moodswings are quite intense and I've definetly had weight gain.
23	2767	No weight gain, or mood swings or anything but now it got pretty bad.
23	2768	No periods, no pain, no mood swings, no weight gain, and no babies.
23	2769	I have been on this birth control going on my second year, I haven't noticed any weight gain, and I have had very few periods.
23	2770	I've always been very active so the weight gain was unexplainable.

23	2772	I did not experience any weight gain.
23	2773	I have had some effects which are irregular menstrual cycles and weight gain which the doctor did say was very common.
23	2774	If you want to feel like you're walking in a cloud, forgetfulness, constant fatigue, fits of rage, depression and crying fits, personality changes, weight gain and constant anxiety and you can't make sense of any of it, then get the Nexplanon.
23	2775	I've also experienced weight gain (I was 170 when I got it and I'm now 207), and also it's hard to lose it.
23	2776	I have about 3months with the "device" and I have noticed anxiety, weight gain, lack of energy all I want to do is sleep and well bleeding/spotting every day.

23	2778	Extreme weight gain that I can't shake off.

23	2832	The weight gain is horrible and no matter what you do like eat healthy, or go to the gym it will not shed.

23	2846	No weight gain, but I do work out almost daily.

23	2876	I'm please with the implant helping my period and I can live with the bad skin and weight gain xxx

23	2878	I haven't experienced any weight gain or hair loss!

23	2889	I loved this method of birth control bc for one NO BABIES and this is my third year now it's due to come out in October and also no periods however I was a light bleeder and my breast got huge started out a B now a dd and weight gain I thought the weight gain was because I started drinking and partying and having sex more which could also have a factor to do with it but I have to work three times harder to loose weight which is a killer I'm thinking about trying mirena again or paragard lower hormones or none and getting them to soften up my cervix and also I have become very moody but before reading that as a side effect I thought it was just me growing up got it when I was 19 now 22
23	2890	No periods, no weight gain, no mood swings.

23	2894	I had no weight gain and no mood swings, but the first few weeks I felt so tired!

23	2896	I plan to keep an eye out for the weight gain.
23	2897	I've had this for about 4 months now and its stopped my periods completely, I love it as a form of birth control but the main down side is the weight gain.

23	2900	I did experience weight gain, a panic attack, and suicidal thoughts.
23	2901	No weight gain (I've actually LOST weight) and the only thing negative I could say is I have a tiny circular scar where it was placed, but it doesn't bother me at all.
23	2902	I got it two weeks ago, its wonderful, no weight gain so far.
23	2903	The only good thing about this is I didn't get pregnant but from all the weight gain I'm super depressed now.
23	2904	3rd, the weight gain is out of control.
23	2905	It caused me nothing but issues such as 20 lb weight gain, depression, extreme hunger, month long periods (I was basically always on my period.)
23	2906	Pros: No weight gain, no pill, light periods.
23	2907	I haven't really had a period since then..  and in Nov it will be 1 year with me having it in.. no weight gain and if so it's me because I love to eat.. lol.. but no other side effects for me!!!
23	2908	My doctor keeps trying to blame me for the weight gain but I eat between 900-1200cal a day and it's mostly vegetables or tofu!
23	2909	My OB insists that the Nexplanon shouldn't be the cause of my weight gain, but I've changed nothing else during this time frame.
23	2910	I realize that it's a very fail proof birth control, but I can't take this weight gain any longer.

23	2915	The weight gain along with the emotions makes me feel even worse and then leads to more sadness.
23	2916	I started noticing weight gain, about 15 pounds and for my height it showed a lot.

23	2919	I'm gaining literally a lot of weight, at first the weight gain isn't noticeable, but then it just hits you.
23	2920	Some weight gain, but again doubt it's Nexplanon related.
23	2921	I have no weight gain and am 115lbs.
23	2922	And I'm so excited for the weight gain, just hope it's not excessive!!!!
23	2923	Not much weight gain although I have lost about 3 pounds.
23	2924	Though the weight gain is good for me since I've always been hopelessly underweight no matter what I did.
23	2925	Other than that I've had no weight gain,  no break outs,  or anything awful.
23	2926	I haven't experienced any weight gain or mood swings like I did with daily pills or the depo shot.
23	2927	I got the implant April 29th 2015 and I started bleeding today (May 23rd 2015) I haven't had any breakouts, no weight gain and no mood swings but it may just be too soon to determine.
23	2928	However after 6months I noticed a drastic increase in weight gain and crying whenever stressed, which was not an issue before.
23	2929	As far as weight gain i have'nt gained or lost weight.
23	2930	This is absolutely amazing seeing as though I decided to change my birth control from depo due to the ridiculous 60lb weight gain I had in less than a year on that.
23	2931	Other than the weight gain I loved the nexplanon.
23	2932	I've also not had any of the other side effects some people have had such as weight gain.

23	2936	No weight gain actually lost weight.
23	2937	And my breasts have gone up from a large B/small C to a large C. Other than the weight gain I have no problems with the Nexplanon Implant.
23	2938	The one thing I will say though is that it made me gain 15 pounds within the first 3 months but other than that no further weight gain
23	2939	No random breakouts on my face and no weight gain from it.
23	2940	Also have not noticed any particular weight gain or moodiness so far.

23	2947	No weight gain, but I do get cravings when it should be my time of the month.
23	2948	Bleeding has stopped for 6 weeks and counting although I am fighting slight weight gain of 3 to 5 pounds.
23	2949	And I don't have to keep up with any other birth control, no side effects no mood change, love having sex and no weight gain.
23	2950	I haven't had any weight gain, but I am also an avid exerciser.
23	2951	I also notice a significant weight gain was wondering if it's because I don't get a period and what can I do?
23	2952	I can't speak for those who have had weight gain, as I am always hungry and put on a bit of weight from thyroid issues.
23	2953	I've had no side effects such as weight gain.
23	2954	I have breakouts more than normal and slight weight gain.
23	2955	No weight gain and it has helped me lose weight.
23	2956	But not only that, Nexplanon does not have a side effect of gaining weight, it's explained to you when you get it that it doesn't have the hormone that birth control pills have that cause weight gain.
23	2957	I have not had any significant problems with weight gain.
23	2958	I am extremely moody and have experienced a slight weight gain.

23	2963	I also have a friend that has it and she really likes it although she has experienced some weight gain.
23	2964	So far my experience with this birth control method has been fabulous, I got it 6wks postpartum & had one period that was very light bleeding and lasted about a week, I haven't experienced weight gain nor hair loss.
23	2965	Hair loss, yeast infection, frequent discharges, and especially weight gain!
23	2966	CONS: Weight gain of 7lbs in 6 months, and the biggest con of all.
23	2967	Had some bad mood swings the first month and have had a minimal amount of weight gain over 6 months (3-5 lbs).
23	2968	except for a little bit of weight gain but I can use it because I'm already really skinny.
23	2969	Since being on this medication I have found that my anxiety level is much higher (which my anxiety is anger based) I go 2-3 weeks without a period then about 2-3 weeks ON with a period (usually light but still annoying) and the biggest kicker is my weight gain.
23	2970	I have noticed a little weight gain but not a lot.
23	2971	I also did not experience any weight gain, in fact, my breasts decreased in size (unfortunately for a AA cup).
23	2972	Other than that, no weight gain (I've actually lost weight after gaining 15lbs in 8 mos on pills!

23	3206	And said all I do is sit on my ass that's why I gained it.
23	3207	I've gained 40lbs, always tired and sad, I have terrible mood swings and I'm severely depressed.
23	3208	I haven't gained weight.
23	3209	My periods are so minimal I almost forget I have them, I haven't gained weight or had any serious side effects!
23	3210	I have also gained 20 pounds (but that could also be attributed to me going to college) but overall, this birth control does what it's supposed to, with some uncomfortable side effects.
23	3211	I've gained 20 almost 30 pounds!
23	3212	I have not gained any weight i actually lost 5 pounds on it.
23	3213	I gained about 15-20 pounds on and off the whole time and the one side effect I get the most is numbness.
23	3214	Some minor changes were that my breasts gained a cup size for the first six months (the only side effect I miss!
23	3215	), and I gained 7lbs within the first three months (not really an issue to me, but I did notice it was difficult to shift, even with a controlled diet and exercise routine).
23	3216	I gained 60 lbs in the matter of a few months (I am not exaggerating).
23	3217	However, I've gained 30 pounds and that's why I removed it before the time.
23	3218	I gained 10 pounds within the first year and the other 20 this past year.
23	3219	I have gained 30(+) pounds!!!
23	3220	I have not gained weight but my skin is not as nice as it was when I was on the pill.
23	3221	I have already gained about 15-20lbs and I haven't even had it for a year.
23	3222	I gained 20 pounds even despite the fact that I am a vegetarian and workout 6 times a week.
23	3223	I have gained 18 pounds and I've never had a problem with weight.
23	3224	Now they are a lot lighter only downside is that I gained a few pounds (I became a lot less active also which added to the gained weight).
23	3225	I also gained about 50 pounds.
23	3226	Mostly because I had gained weight making it a bit harder to get the nexplanon out.
23	3227	I wouldn't say it made me gain weight, but the weight I have gained is almost impossible to lose.
23	3228	I haven't gained any weight, my skin is clearer than ever and I am definitely not pregnant.
23	3229	oh i gained weight because the birth control."
23	3230	I gained 25lbs, had horrible mood swings, irregular bleeding but didn't get pregnant.
23	3231	This birth control is great if your one to forget the pill (like myself) but I've been on it for a year and have gained at least 40 pounds!!!
23	3232	I've always been a bigger girl weighing around 180-190 but this past year I've been more active in my career than ever and ive gained 40 pounds.
23	3233	I gained 30 pounds while this thing has been in my arm and it has really made me feel awful about myself.
23	3234	This is the 2nd yr & after my period went off about a week later I had sex & had a period after that but now I don't have one.. Only thing I HATE about this BC is that it makes me feel like I could be pregnant & ive gained a lot of weight.
23	3235	I've also gained 30lbs w/o changing my diet so I ate less and gained 10 more.
23	3236	I've gained almost 40 pounds since being on Nexplanon.
23	3237	I gained nearly 45 pounds while on.
23	3238	I gained 40 pounds of water weight (edema).
23	3239	The only cons with this is that I never gained any weight, my skin got a little bit better and its convenient!
23	3240	I've gained 10-15 lbs (I stopped weighing myself- it was too depressing).
23	3241	It's caused me 2 have serious  stomach  issues with pain & seseitvity back & for to docs 2 see why I'm always in pain can puke at any time I want just like I was pregnant.my head is always pounding my hair is oily & I've gained over 50 pounds and I'm very active even though I have no energy I make myself walk or hike a lot!
23	3242	this birth control makes me feel pregnant,no period, mood swings, cravings,every symptom a woman can have during pregnancy,i suffer from,i've also gained 30 lb.s since insertion,extreme exhaustion, I used to never be able to sleep,now all I want to do is sleep,im nauseated all day, everything wrong,nothing good
23	3243	I have gained weight, my face stays broken out, and I'm not as happy as I used to be.
23	3244	Not only have I had extreme bleeding issues the WHOLE TIME, but I have also re gained weight that I previously lost.
23	3245	Ever since I got it almost 2 years ago, I have gained almost 50 pounds because of it and I can't lose it.
23	3246	I gained 30 lbs.
23	3247	But I would say the WORST part of this birth control is that I gained over 40 lbs in one year.
23	3248	The bleeding is extremely light so it's not too much of a pain.Other than the bleeding, I have not gained weight aside from my own doing by eating fast food & not working out.
23	3249	I also gained about 7 pounds.
23	3250	Previously when I gained weight on bc, it was very proportional- some at my waist, some at my breasts, etc.- this time, however, it was all around my waist, and exercise did not help.
23	3251	I also gained weight even with going to the gym everyday.
23	3252	I started nexplanon Feb 2nd 2016 the first 2 weeks were great but I got really depressed and had some horrible mood swings I gained 6 pounds but shed that off.
23	3253	My hormones became crazy, I gained more that 50 pounds, and I get annoyed easily.
23	3254	The expiration day is coming in fast.The doctor said he can't do anything until I loose the weight I gained when I got on it, for me that is impossible since nothing helps me loose weight from crazy hormones I have.
23	3255	What I do not like is that I have gained 60-70 lbs since I've gotten it.
23	3256	I really don't like how much weight I've gained from it.
23	3257	I've also gained weight since it was implanted and I am an avid yogi.
23	3258	never gained a pound, never went through any side effects and never got pregnant.
23	3259	I have gained 25 pounds.
23	3260	I've gained 23lbs since then, and no matter how hard I try, I can't lose it, and just keep getting heavier.
23	3261	I've gained 12-15lbs.
23	3262	I haven't gained any weight.
23	3263	I have bled for 9 months gained 50 lbs and my boobs have blowed up like ballons.
23	3264	I haven't gained weight with this implant ether.
23	3265	I definitely don't want to gain weight especially while still on the process of loosing the 35lbs I gained while pregnant.
23	3266	As for weight I've gained probably 6 pounds so far.
23	3267	I wanted it out once I noticed that my period wouhdn't come and that I was aggressive and cause I gained a lot of weight I'm like 200 pounds.
23	3268	I've gained 20 POUNDS since it was put in and it's only January!
23	3269	I gained 20 lbs on Nexplanon over the course of a year and a half, gaining 10 of those during the last 3 months while dieting.
23	3270	Migraines, nausea, gained 20 lbs, even had hot flashes.
23	3271	Not to mention I've gained like 20lbs.
23	3272	I have gained some mega weight which sucks but I don't watch what I eat either.
23	3273	I was put on this birth control when I was 15 I was 150lbs I gained 50lbs then I replaced it and got a new one and I'm gaining even more weight it barely helps with periods anymore my periods last for 5 weeks at a time now and barely anytime in between to have a break
23	3274	I gained weight, I didn't change my eating or exercise habits so I know it wasn't my lifestyle that did it.
23	3275	I have gained 60 pounds, began to lose my hair, started sprouting manly hair all over my body, and developed cysts under my skin due to this.
23	3276	I have gained about 40-50 lbs in the last 2 years!!!!
23	3277	Now three months later I've gained 20 lbs and the periods have become worse!
23	3278	I have not become pregnant but I have gained a lot of weight.
23	3279	I gained about fifteen-twenty pounds.
23	3280	Other than that I've gained weight and struggled to lose (still haven't and still struggling).
23	3281	I've gained maybe 5-10lbs.
23	3282	I gained a bunch of weight, I started having pregnancy side effects and that is what made me take the stick out.
23	3283	I haven't gained weight, I don't have any hormonal side affects, or anything like that.
23	3284	I've lost hair, I've gained weight, my back and stomach hurt all the time and I am literally psychotic my emotions never stop.
23	3285	It was basically a last resort because I got pregnant on birth control pills, gained 80 pounds on depo, nuvaring didn't agree with my body & my mirena IUD dislodged itself and almost perforated my cervix and vaginal wall.
23	3286	[Review Part Six] I haven't gained any weight, which is cool.My periods have completely stopped, which is also cool because I used to have extremely painful periods.But, I haven't gained anything positive whatsoever from the Nexplanon implant.
23	3287	I had this in for three years and over the time I have gained 30 pounds and also experienced long periods, moodswings and headaches.I just had it removed today because I don't want the extra hormones I'm thinking of getting my tubes tied because I'm over the birth control.
23	3288	Only then, after reading more closely into side-effects of the implant, did I realise that the 30 lbs I've gained in that time may be linked.
23	3289	I'm sick of the mood swings, and the weight I've gained with it, I used to have such a flat skinny tummy and now I don't anymore.
23	3290	I've also gained a tremendous amount of weight.
23	3291	I gained 20 lbs in the first month and another 10 soon after.
23	3292	I've gained a lot of weight since on this BC and have been on others in the past but this is by far the worst one.
23	3293	I have gained over 30 pounds.
23	3294	But I do have a heart condition, depression, a thyroid problem and I've gained 47 pounds.
23	3295	I lost weight at first then I gained it back.
23	3296	Also, I've gained like 10 pounds.
23	3297	I have gained weight about 10lbs, but I'm not entirely sure if that is from Nexplanon or no longer nursing.
23	3298	I've gained 30 pounds, have insomnia, and am moody and depressed.
23	3299	During those 3 months I also gained 30 pounds!
23	3300	I've gained over 5 pound and conitnue to gain weight.
23	3301	Not surprisingly, I've gained weight because  of this.
23	3302	I've neither lost or gained weight.
23	3303	I have also gained 15 lbs...I have always been slender..and now I have worn sweat pants for the past 6 months because none of my clothes fit.
23	3304	I started the nexplanon in May 2014 and ever since then I gained 17 pounds.
23	3305	I got on it because of heavy bleeding and I'll say it works very efficient for that but....The mood swings are horrible like nothing I've ever experienced.I've gained around 5  pounds so far that I just can't keep off.So it works for what I got it but the side effects are pretty bad.
23	3306	When that finally stopped I instantly gained  about 30 pounds.
23	3307	But I have gained quite a bit of weight,  I went from a flat stomach to a little bit of a pudge.
23	3308	I gained over 30 pounds within 2 years.
23	3309	But I have gained 10lbs, no matter how much I workout I can't seem to lose it.

23	3390	I would not recommend this to anyone I have gained so much weight this is the most I weighed every in my life I eat healthy plus work out and noth change.
23	3391	So far with the nexplanon I have been able to lose the weight I gained on the pill and very rarely feel angry.
23	3392	I have gained 10 lbs which is what I didn't want to happen especially right after having a baby!
23	3393	I have gained a significant amount of weight while on birth control but eating junk food doesn't help either.
23	3394	Six months into having the implant, and I have gained about 20 lbs and have a fair amount of hair loss.
23	3395	Now that I'm on nexplanon I have lost all the weight that I've gained and more, I don't have to take the pill,my period is very light and haven't had one since but we will see.
23	3396	I had it the full three years 2012-2015 and I gained 30 pounds on it.
23	3397	Cramps have reduced and I have gained no weight.
23	3398	Had it for the first 3 years and I noticed that I had gained quite a bit of weight, roughly 50 pounds.
23	3399	I've gained 30 pounds and my diet had remained the same since before it was put in.
23	3400	After about 3 months I had gained 10 pounds after not gaining any weight at all before the procedure.
23	3401	However, I have gained about 25 pounds, averaging 10 pounds per year.
23	3402	I have gained so much weigh plus my period last a month then a two week break then another month long period.
23	3403	I have been depressed and gained 22 lbs.
23	3404	My doctor decided to remove it because i wasn't able to lose those gained pounds , we thought it will be better with something else with less hormones!!
23	3405	I have not gained a lot of weight but I can be moody from time to time but overall this birth control is the easiest option!
23	3406	After she got it in she gained almost 65 pounds she was 115lb.
23	3407	My skin is the same, I haven't gained any weight (actually lost a few pounds), a little mood swings, no periods, and no pregnancy.
23	3408	On implanon, I gained some weight over the 3 years (probably 15 lbs) but I was able to lose it with exercise.
23	3409	I've gained probably 30 lbs since I had it put in in January 2014.
23	3410	I now have gained about twenty pounds and I have cellulite everywhere.
23	3411	I've gained 25 pounds, I don't want to have sex, plus who wants to have sex on their period!?
23	3412	I gained weight but it's nothing I can't lose at the gym.
23	3413	I haven't gained weight or lost my hair.
23	3414	I have gained a little bit of weight and my breasts have gotten bigger.
23	3415	I have been taking aerobics for 10 weeks and I gained weight instead (<8lbs).
23	3416	I decided to remove it to see if I lose the 30lbs I gained and with a change to an organic diet will reverse my precancerous  cells and if I'll lose weight too.
23	3417	I'm a little moody and gained 15 pounds, but I also don't exercise a lot.
23	3418	But then I gained almost 40 lbs even though I hadn't changed my diet or exercise routine.
23	3419	Yet I still gained a good 40lbs with a healthy diet and working out 5 days a week.
23	3420	Now two years later...I have gained over 30lbs and I have not had any changes in my lifestyle.
23	3421	After that I gained it all back and then some, I've worked out and watched my portions but nothing has helped.
23	3422	I've gained 15 pounds I can't seem to lose.
23	3423	I have gained 7Lbs since starting this.
23	3424	But now I have gained weight and even when I don't eat or only eat salads and eat healthy,I can't lose weight.
23	3425	I've also gained 15 pounds and I don't think its worth all the side effects
23	3426	I've gained like four pounds, but it's not the end of the world.
23	3427	I haven't gained any weight which is the only plus.
23	3428	Also I have gained a lot of weight.
23	3429	I think I may have gained 10lbs.
23	3430	I've gained 22 lbs, 15 being in the first two months.
23	3431	I also have not gained any weight (actually lost 10 lbs).
23	3432	I've gained so much.
23	3433	But I've gained a lot of weight.
23	3434	I gained 10 pounds within two weeks of having this, all in my stomach.
23	3435	With the Depo shot I had a period for 2 months, gained 40 pounds.
23	3436	I have gained a little weight and my mood swings are all over the place but its nothing I can't control.
23	3437	The only thing I don't like is that I gained 10lbs.
23	3438	I have gained weight and I have felt some nausea.
23	3439	But I have gained about 20-30 pounds since I have been on it.
23	3440	However, it is TERRIBLE for me I have since gained 40 pounds!
23	3441	But I've gained about 15 pounds which is the only reason I'm thinking of getting it removed.
23	3442	I haven't gained any weight on Nexplanon.
23	3443	I have gained about ten pounds and depression and anxiety have gotten worse.
23	3444	I cry a lot now and I'm always hungry, although I haven't gained any weight.
23	3445	I gained 10 pounds, I'm only keeping it for the birth control and because it regulates my addictive sexual activity.
23	3446	I have only been on it for a month and I have already gained 10 pounds.
23	3447	I have gained 35 lbs the last 3 months and have not changed my eating habits or lifestyle.
23	3448	I hate it, I've gained almost 30 pounds with it and counting!
23	3449	And I gained 50 pounds!
23	3450	I haven't gained any weight, in fact I've lost weight.
23	3451	I've gained 15 pounds but I've always ate a little more than usual so I'm not 100% sure it's the birth control.
23	3452	I have not gained weight so that is a plus.
23	3453	I've also gained around 5lbs without changing anything else in my lifestyle.
23	3454	I've also gained a little weight.
23	3455	I haven't gained a ton of weight, my skin does break out a bit more though.
23	3456	In the last 6 months I have gained 20 lbs.
23	3457	I gained ten pounds that I can't seem to shake; despite GAINING weight, my breasts have SHRUNK over a cup size.
23	3458	And I have gained about 25-30 pounds, Without changing my exercising or eating habits.
23	3459	I have gained a little weight also.
23	3460	I've gained about 5-8 pounds but it could be other environmental factors.
23	3461	I have not gained weight.
23	3462	After November 2013 I had a period every other day and it only lasted an hour, not to mention I have gained 60LBS and my doctor refuses to remove it.
23	3463	No I'm not fat but I have gained some weight.
23	3464	I've gained 15lbs and there has been no change in my diet.
23	3465	I have gained a little weight, but I'm quite skinny, so I don't mind.
23	3466	I am coming up on a year being on this and have gained a total of about 18lbs without much change in my diet.
23	3467	I haven't gained any weight or had a change in appetite.
23	3468	Also, not as noticeable at first- I've gained weight steadily.
23	3469	I haven't gained any weight except maybe a pound or two but that's because I already had a weakness for sweets.
23	3470	I had gained 16 lbs.
23	3471	I haven't gained any weight or lost any hair, my hair is actually longer than its ever been.
23	3472	I haven't gained any weight, I've actually lost, but I eat right and exercise.
23	3473	I also gained about 15 pounds but that was ok with me because I am super skinny and needed it!
23	3474	I've gained over 20 lbs.
23	3475	I think I gained 22lbs I went from 116lbs to 138lbs.
23	3476	I decided I had enough of the Depo shot gained 10lbs on it.
23	3477	I've gained like 20lbs as well.
23	3478	I've also gained about 15 pounds.
23	3479	I have gained weight but I do recommend this to many young girls and women.
23	3480	This was due to the extreme nausea and lack of appetite.
23	3481	I had the usual nausea and dizziness.
23	3482	Headaches & nausea prevent you from living your life to the fullest.
23	3483	Minor side effect like nausea and some mood swings here and there.
23	3484	Without birth control I have a very harsh period that consists of heavy bleeding, vomiting, nausea, fatigued and sometimes I even faint.
23	3485	I have had constant nausea where I thought I was pregnant.
23	3486	It's also like I haven't eaten, and makes the nausea go away afterwards.
23	3487	(I stopped using the pill Levora due to excessive nausea).
23	3488	I don't have to worry about it, the bleeding has stopped (so far altogether, but it's only been near 2 months), I have no nausea from it, no known side effects honestly.
23	3489	I had pregnancy symptoms on Nexplanon including nausea in the mornings.
23	3490	I got the implant out 2/21, and now I have the worst nausea of my life.
23	3491	Migraines, nausea, abdominal pain, mood swings, weakness and insomnia and countless other problems.
23	3492	My doctor told me that my nausea was coming from my nexplanon after having it two years & three months & I should probably get it removed.
23	3493	I had mood swings and nausea severely in the first three months.
23	3494	I first got on Implanon after the birth of my daughter back in 2013, I've always had anxiety & I'm young so I figured that everything was normal because many women have depression after giving birth, however, when I got back on the implant, (this time Nexplanon, in Feb 2016), I started feeling worse & worse; panic attacks, dizziness & nausea, now I'm planning to have it taken out.
23	3495	No nausea like the pills, no vaginal wetness like the ring, no aches in bones like depo...
23	3496	I think it is also the cause of my dizziness, lightheadedness, and nausea.
23	3497	At first I was so excited to not have to worry about pregnancy scares, forgetting to take my pill, and the nausea I would receive if I took it at the wrong time of day.
23	3498	I hate the nausea feeling and the small increase in breast size but I can handle it.
23	3499	The only other side effects is nausea and increased appetite.
23	3500	During this last 2.5 years I have been bloated had nausea and horrible IBS symptoms which I believe to be associated from the birth control.
23	3501	Since then I have constant nausea, I have gain weight ( I work out out daily), and I am only off my period 1 week out the month.. Other than the fact it is quite effective I completely hate it.
23	3502	It was so bad that I went to the doctor & she prescribed me pills to help with the nausea while I waited to see if I would get adjusted to it or not.
23	3503	Dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, and I was always tired.
23	3504	And there's no nausea or really any warning..
23	3505	I also have experienced pregnancy like sypmtoms such as nausea, and sometimes actually vomitting!
23	3506	My breast hurt when I first got it and I experienced nausea while hungry.
23	3507	I still have terrible nausea when I'm hungry but I've learned how to manage it the best way I can.
23	3508	I always felt like I was pregnant because I had symptoms like nausea, bloating, mood swings, and my breasts swelled up.
23	3509	Then, instead of bearable pain, I now have it pretty bad with nausea.
23	3510	The first few days were rough, my arm would feel like the muscle strength would randomly disappear sometimes and there was a day where I had a few hours of morning sickness like nausea.
23	3511	I have extreme nausea everyday ( especially when i get up in the morning ) and randomly multiple times throughout the day, its hard for me to go to school and do normal things because i feel so sick.
23	3512	I was sluggish barely able to walk, dizzy, nausea was my best friend like seriously.
23	3513	A new side effect that's gotten pretty out of control lately has been my mood swings (I cry over any little thing, I'm emotional about EVERYTHING) and the nausea (NOT FUN).
23	3514	Headaches and nausea make me think I am pregnant.
23	3515	There is also a lot of nausea for me.
23	3516	The only side effects I have experienced was nausea the first week (only for a short time midday) and I was moody for a short period (I also was on my period when it was inserted - so I cannot rule out that I was still PMSing).
23	3517	Only complaint is that I get a little nausea when I wake up but it goes away.
23	3518	I occasionally will get bouts of nausea and during my normal monthly hormone fluctuations tend to get a little weepy but my Dr. told me to expect this as the first few months the hormone is a little stronger.
23	3519	I'm always tired and I'm always nauseated.
23	3520	As it got closer to the end date I started to feel nauseated every day & throwing up sometimes for three weeks.
23	3521	I am nauseated ALL the time and sick ALL the time.
23	3522	I also started to feel nauseous every time I ate something.
23	3523	Within hours of having it put in I felt so sick and nauseous.
23	3524	I've been nauseous, having cravings, fatigued.
23	3525	I have used this method of birth control because I tried the pill and it made me nauseous and the IUD was too much pain to insert.
23	3526	I was nauseous and constantly felt dehydrated.
23	3527	I'll take ibuprofen or Tylenol and I get nauseous!
23	3528	It's effected my stomach and made me nauseous even.
23	3529	This does not make me feel sick, or nauseous but it's VERY difficult to keep buying pads, I never spent this much when's I didn't use birth control!
23	3530	Pills make me nauseous.
23	3531	I do get nauseous here & there, & my skin is a lot more oily but other than that I can't really complain.
23	3532	Oh and I feel nauseous all the time.
23	3533	A year later of being on nexplanon had made me feel weak and nauseous at times, heck i sometimes swore I was pregnant.
23	3534	I get nauseous very easily and suddenly.
23	3535	The first couple of weeks was perfect, but after I started feeling nauseous, dizzy and anxious all the time.
23	3536	Until now, my hair is falling out and starting to thin, I have bad chest pains, I get dizzy, nauseous, makes my stomach hurt with everything that I eat, depression, and suicidal thoughts.
23	3537	I feel sick constantly as well as nauseous and light headed.
23	3538	I get light headed and nauseous.
23	3539	I am also nauseous a lot.
23	3540	The very next day I became very nauseous & kept gagging.
23	3541	The only side effects are that sometime when lifting heavy objects I get really weak, also it's made me very nauseous to any smell.
23	3542	The first month I had heavy dizzy spells, I couldn't walk without holding onto the wall and felt nauseous.
23	3543	I've lost a few pounds since getting nexplanon because it does suppress my appetite quiet a bit ( from 125 to 118) the first couple days after insertion I was a little nauseous and couldn't really eat.
23	3544	I was recommended this as I get extremely nauseous with most birth control pills, and haven't experienced any since getting it.
23	3545	I still have it a week later and now I'm nauseous.
23	3546	My other side effects were right after I got it I had heartburn for about 2 weeks and I was nauseous at night for a couple of days.
23	3547	I was nauseous everyday, very moody, and stressed out for no reason.
23	3548	Not nauseous at all, and I was nauseous for 9 months everyday.
23	3549	Sometimes I am hungry all the time for days, other times I am nauseous every time I eat.
23	3550	I would get nauseous after eating, so I stopped eating as much.
23	3551	For weeks at a time I will either be extremely nauseous and not hungry at all, or very hungry all the time.
23	3552	I also almost constantly feel nauseous and I believe it's caused depression symptoms.
23	3553	Hot flashes and I felt super nauseous when I would get hungry.
23	3554	However, I'm noticing that exercise makes me nauseous.
23	3555	Also, when I get hungry but aren't home to eat, I get nauseous too.
23	3556	I've been nauseous nonstop!
23	3557	I found myself with a sore throat, slight rash on my face, abdominal and back pain as well as a swollen groin, blurry vision and really sore breast (almost severe), so dizzy and fatigue I couldn’t stand I even had chills for days and the mood swings were crazy.
23	3558	(Basically, I have to eat a breakfast and eat lunch no later than 1 if I want to avoid getting dizzy.)
23	3559	The day after I got it done, I experienced a dizzy spell.
23	3560	2 days after I got it done, I experienced a second dizzy spell.
23	3561	Once in awhile I would get super dizzy and lightheaded.
23	3562	I got so depressed I was having really dark thoughts, and I was always dizzy and tired.
23	3563	My mood has been horrible, and I am dizzy all the time.
23	3564	I get dizzy spells and literally have zero energy.
23	3565	I go through 4 emotions a day, I have sleepless nights, feel drained and dizzy everyday.
23	3566	I feel dizzy and light head, angry, depressed, I had a period for most of the time.
23	3567	I had the nexplanon implanted and everything was fine then 9 months later it started making me dizzy and passing out along with chest pain it almost put me in the hospital I would not recommend this to anyone.
23	3568	After reading reviews, some say they need to snack every 2-3 hours to not feel dizzy... At that point I would rather not have the implant at all.
23	3569	Also, get very dizzy frequently.
23	3570	It is effective of not getting you pregnant but the symptoms are not worth it i was thrpwing up,dizzy, having hot flashes, bad ass stomach pains and back pains very far more worst than having another baby.
23	3571	It makes me light-headed and dizzy...so bad that half the time I can't even drive my car!
23	3572	I hate this I got this implanted in late February 2016& about a week after insertion I started feeling sick flu like symptoms weak light headed and dizzy I lost weight I feel depressed and I always feel like crying...I feel lethargic at times for no reason  this does not agree with my body like the Implannon did!!!
23	3573	I have never before been dizzy and now I have vertigo all the time (lately every day) which makes even walking hard sometimes.
23	3574	I'm dizzy when I stand up and become short of breath easily.
23	3575	Just got this implant today and I've been a little dizzy.
23	3576	Wasn't bad I been feeling on and off dizzy spells I do suffer from panic disorder but that another story its too early to give a fair rating I hope this works out
23	3577	Then I start feeling dizzy, so I went to the hospital.
23	3578	This month has been dreadful, I have been depressed, stressed, crying, bleeding for 3 weeks now and I feel dizzy nearly every day.
23	3579	It wasn't painful but however after you do get dizzy and sleepy after you get it inserted.
23	3580	If I get too hungry I start feeling super dizzy.
23	3581	Also, the first few days of adjusting to the medicine was tough and I was dizzy quite a bit, but that has since waned.
23	3582	Headaches and dizziness are also common for me.
23	3583	Constant bleeding/Clotting brown goo, anxiety, depression(I just want to be alone most of the time), vulnerable, sensitivity, ACNE(skin has been moderately clear my whole life), Insecurity, lack of appetite, dizziness, and lack of sleep & concentration.
23	3584	I also had depression, NAUSEA,& dizziness.
23	3585	Terrible dizziness.
23	3586	Body pain, stomach issues, dizziness to the extent of having vertigo, etc.
23	3587	I just had the implant removed after 6 months of awful mood swings, 3-week-long periods, dizziness, morning sickness symptoms, insomnia, and heightened anxiety.
23	3588	dizziness!
23	3589	After this I suffered awful, awful physical symptoms such as: weakness in limbs, extreme dizziness (vertigo symptoms) sickness, my whole body even went numb at one point!
23	3590	I am experiencing dizziness more lately and I'm sad quite a bit.
23	3591	I can't get myself to be happy unless I'm with my daughter and sometimes the small things she does makes me have another mood swing.
23	3592	I started loosing my hair, I did not ever want to have sex with my boyfriend, I had terrible mood swing, I was depressed and I actually lost weight.
23	3593	Hopefully my mind can remain stable enough to make it til then without another crazy mood swing of depression.
23	3594	I've had mood swing, I've been prescribed antidepressants, and most recently I had a period that lasted 5 months straight.
23	3595	had this birth control for two years and let me tell u it made me mad crazy I cried for no reason I had horrible mood swing horrible migrains I got super depress
23	3596	However, my mood swings started kicking in and they were horrible.
23	3597	My breasts are always tender (have been since I got this inserted), and my mood swings are still kind of bad, but they’re getting better.
23	3598	My wife has depression, and this device caused her mental state to bypass "mood swings," and go for super extreme mood change status - almost caused divorce, and would have if it hadn't been removed 3 days ago.
23	3599	No massive mood swings.
23	3600	It doesn't give me weird mood swings or make me gain weight.
23	3601	In the beginning it gave me terrible mood swings.
23	3602	I'm not gonna say I was having mood swings.
23	3603	The mood swings, depression and anxiety is REAL ladies.
23	3604	I think I did have terrible mood swings the first couple months (mixed with the heartache of a breakup) so that was horrid, but it's been over 2 years since insertion and I'm 100% me, happy when I'm not PMS-ing, and pretty much worry free!!
23	3605	Mood swings were crazy though, my family didn't want me going to the house anymore, I almost lost my 4 year relationship boyfriend, but good thing he was understandable about the mood swings.
23	3606	The mood swings are outrageous.
23	3607	I’m literally irritated about everything, that turns into anger, then it turns into crying because of the frustration of the mood swings.
23	3608	I have had slight mood swings, however that comes with any birth control.
23	3609	The depression, anger, anxiety, and even suicidal effects of this birth control  not only drove me insane but my family & boyfriend could no longer deal with my mood swings.
23	3610	I need mine out asap only had it in for about 3 month and its the worse thing ever constantly bleed mood swings are unreal constantly arguing with my boyfriend for no such reason .
23	3611	I didn't get pregnant, which was good, but I experienced extreme "mood swings" and "depression".
23	3612	This is my 2nd Nexplanon the first go around was fine I didn’t experience the mood swings or anything of that nature.. however towards the end I had my period for almost a month straight... my 3 yrs was up and I got it again hoping it would be different and NOPE!!
23	3613	I had mood swings, crazy periods  and out of the norm behavior.
23	3614	Did not notice mood swings or change to my emotions (at least I don’t think so).
23	3615	Less mood swings.
23	3616	The Acne it causes comes and goes, and my mood swings are major but I guess every woman has a different reaction to it.
23	3617	The bleeding stuck around through 2 months of pills and was accompanied by mood swings (which to be honest could have been due to the several month long period).
23	3618	I have had the worst mood swings and horrendous anxiety and anger towards my loving boyfriend.
23	3619	My mood swings were insane and I honestly felt like a different person.
23	3620	My mood swings have been all over the board and I find myself feeling depressed and anxious more often than not.
23	3621	They're between 9 and 16 days apart, they're heavy, and I have really awful mood swings.
23	3622	My mood swings and anxiety have been unmanageable.
23	3623	Terrible mood swings, basically on my period for an entire year, and had some of the heaviest periods I've ever experienced.
23	3624	I'm constantly tired, starving, I have crazy mood swings, I put on 20+ pounds, my clothes don't fit me any more.
23	3625	I had just about every side effect listed on their site, from mood swings, to even being diagnosed with vaginitis due to the implant.
23	3626	I expected the appetite change and bleeding, they didn't bother me too much but the mood swings got me, I thought I was going crazy.
23	3627	Then there is the mood swings and the anger, I'm just horrible!!
23	3628	I'm rating it an 8 because I have only one complaint: mood swings.
23	3629	Previous to this I was taking the pill (Apri) and I experienced some mood swings, but nothing compared to on this.
23	3630	For the first 6 months I had crazy mood swings.
23	3631	The first week I was very emotional and my mood swings were crazy but that settled down pretty quickly.
23	3632	I had mood swings terribly, but it did its job no babies.
23	3633	About one year after using this product I started having mood swings feeling so weak and tired,but never thought about my Nexplanon having to be the blame!
23	3634	The final straw was the extreme mood swings I had.
23	3635	I also experienced very strong mood swings starting a few months in - I would go from feeling perfectly fine to wanting to cry at the slightest thing and I usually couldn't shake off the negative feelings for the rest of the day.
23	3636	Mood swings like no other.
23	3637	It's made my health so much worse periods horrible and mood swings.
23	3638	My mood swings are stable.
23	3639	I've had crazy mood swings that I've never seen myself have before.

23	3652	I started to have mood swings and felt very depressed most of the time.
23	3653	The last few months however, I've had really horrible mood swings and been extremely depressed.
23	3654	I've become depressed and have mean mood swings!
23	3655	I have always been a happy positive strong person but this year has been terrible due to the mood swings caused by the nexplanon.
23	3656	The only thing that I don't like is that I get mood swings like I can be normal and in a matter of nothing I get really cranky and bitchy and I had loose all my patience with my 2 year old son.
23	3657	My first month I experienced minor mood swings and major fatigue and random low blood sugar episodes.
23	3658	The scariest and worst part about the implant were the mood swings.
23	3659	For years I was on birth control to regulate my period and mood swings, but since I'm deployed on a ship for most of the year, I had to pay out of pocket for my pills because my insurance only covered 3 month "vacation" packs.
23	3660	After that's I still had the mood swings and hunger.
23	3661	Already was I experiencing mood swings.
23	3662	The first half a year with it, I experienced annoying mood swings.
23	3663	I've had the nexplanon since 2012, the first round was amazing, no period no side effects what so ever, my second round on the other hand has been pretty bad, I've had the second round about a year now and a couple months after I got a period and was getting it about twice a month, finally I went to my Gyno and he prescribed me progesterone pills a series of 14 and it stopped finally.. then started back up every other week again, I felt like I was going crazy my mood swings and anxiety were on another lever so finally I got blood work at the endocrinologist Bc I thought some thing was seriously wrong with me.
23	3664	That might be one of the mood swings talking but that effectively proves my point.
23	3665	And the mood swings I won't even begin, husband goes crazy so do I, best part it's gonna cost $300 to remove!!
23	3666	Have cravings and bad mood swings.
23	3667	My mood swings are also off the walls.
23	3668	Got this because naturally my mood swings were crazy (very extreme & hormonally-driven) & I wanted to stabilise them a bit.
23	3669	Since getting it inserted I've experience anxieties and mood swings like never before.
23	3670	This has not only made my period out of whack it has also caused me to have crazy mood swings and bouts of depression.
23	3671	Mood Swings, Banging Headaches and  hot/cold flashes.
23	3672	I was going thru so many mood swings and I thought it was from my post partum and lately I've been really annoyed with anything and everyone, the second month my period lasted about 2 weeks the third month I got it twice !
23	3673	Lost a lot of weight while breastfeeding 30 lb including baby weight, but once I stopped breastfeeding the weight came back and definitely had mood swings, irritable & emotional which I never experienced after my first child.
23	3674	On top of the hive I have had severe mood swings and overall am super sensitive.
23	3675	I suffer from depression and lots of anxiety mood swings and yes the implant did make it worst... a lot worst to where I had to fill my whole medicine cubby with a lot of meds.
23	3676	But it does work I will tell you that, the only thing that really bothered me was the mood swings and constant yeast infections.
23	3677	My mood swings have been out of control and my depression has been way worse ever since I have been on this birth control.
23	3678	No mood swings, no anger fits, no overreactions.
23	3679	My mood swings were horrible and I bled all the time.
23	3680	I had nexplanon inserted in January 2017 Before that I was 182 and I'm now 206.The mood swings are horrible and my cravings for food is on a different level.
23	3681	I have not had my period yet, hoping it will stay the same at least, as for the mood swings...every little thing has been getting on my nerves and I have started crying for no reason 3 times already.
23	3682	However, some side affects I've gone through we're mood swings and irregular menstrual cycle.
23	3683	It's convenient but my mood swings are a horrendous!
23	3684	BEWARE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH  and don't think "it's just you" if you have side effects like SEVERE mood swings, depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.
23	3685	No mood swings.
23	3686	I've had this birth control for about 8 months now and ever since then my mood swings and anxiety level are terrible.
23	3687	However recently, since starting university in September, I've had dramatic mood swings and often cry hysterically about nothing when I'm by myself.
23	3688	As I've only ever used low dose estrogen birth control pills, Nexplanon sent my mood swings through the roof within the first two weeks.
23	3689	I mean out of control, cry-in-my-car-at-work , ugly mood swings.
23	3690	The mood swings aren't really happening anymore, I don't feel depressed/anxious/sad at all.
23	3691	If it weren't for the wild mood swings I'd rate a full 10.
23	3692	My mood swings are insane!
23	3693	Mood swings are horrible.
23	3694	I have crazy mood swings for no reason, even when I'm not on my period.
23	3695	in addition to this, my mood swings have been horrible the entire past 10 months.
23	3696	Another thing is I have mood swings that happen every month where I'm either depressed or always angry or both and it happens like one week.
23	3697	I didn't experience mood swings or bad skin.
23	3698	I've had this birth control for almost two years now and in the beginning I had horrible mood swings, granted I was already diagnosed with depression prior to getting this birth control.
23	3699	I also experience mood swings which also have been very unhealthy to my relationship.
23	3700	Now this last 6 months my period has been regular but my mood swings are the same.
23	3701	No mood swings or nothing.
23	3702	I've definitely noticed my skin worsen, I also agree with other reviews about the mood swings.
23	3703	I had horrible mood swings, anxiety and episodes where I felt very depressed and would cry for no reason, which was definitely unlike me.
23	3704	Fast forward to almost a year of having it in now, the mood swings and depression are still there, just not as bad, not as much energy throughout the day and I get my period 2-3 times a month.
23	3705	Second, I been depressed with major mood swings.
23	3706	I've had crazy mood swings and a lot more anger/aggression.
23	3707	I also have much worse mood swings.
23	3708	I have a lot of mood swings
23	3709	I would recommend not getting this treatment unless you want to have depression almost all the time and gain mood swings.
23	3710	5 days after insertion I began to have debilitating mood swings.
23	3711	I've been the same weight since starting, no mood swings, only get my period about 3 times a year for less than  a week.
23	3712	I had bad mood swings!!!
23	3713	And as far as mood swings go, I feel they are a pretty regular side effect to having a period.
23	3714	I haven't had terrible mood swings and when I feel sad or moody I just remind myself that it's the hormones and it's really nothing I can't handle.
23	3715	My mood swings are killer.
23	3716	My mood swings sucks.
23	3717	So far have been on this birth control about 2 months....noticing strong mood swings to.the point im verbally abusing my kids by using swear words constantly.
23	3718	Then I remembered the implant and maybe it's causing me to have extreme mood swings.
23	3719	.I get upset and cry and very insecure I get bad mood swings.
23	3720	I've been on the implant for two years now & the first year was smooth sailing but the 2nd year I started gaining a lot of weight & having uncontrollable mood swings.
23	3721	I also had mood swings, pain from the birth control to my elbow, head aches, my breast was always hurting.
23	3722	My major doubt was regarding mood swings and depression with Nexplanon but after getting it inserted I did not have any of these issues.
23	3723	& I also had severe reduced motivation with extreme tiredness & extreme mood swings
23	3724	I have uncontrollable mood swings.
23	3725	I overall would not recommend this to anyone unless you can deal with extreme mood swings and other health related issues.
23	3726	I did experience some mood swings the first months or so and my period stopped almost immediately (which I'm glad for).
23	3727	I haven't had any mood swings, I had zero menstrual cycles since implantation and I have not gotten pregnant in the past two years.
23	3728	I am getting it taken out a few months early due to the mood swings.
23	3729	After years of taking the pill and going through rigorous mood swings and having to remember to take the pill, I wanted a better option.
23	3730	I also get extreme mood swings from the amount of hormones.
23	3731	Then came the mood swings.
23	3732	When I say mood swings, I mean it felt like I wasn't even being treated for my Bipolar (which was controlled for over a year btw).
23	3733	I have crazy mood swings, depression, and I cry for no reason all the time.
23	3734	I had terrible mood swings.
23	3735	I didn't experience mood swings, depression or anything emotional wise.
23	3736	First yr went well besides anxiety, depression and mood swings.
23	3737	Mood swings from hell that send my family diving for the trenches.
23	3738	My mood swings are absolutely terrible lately and I've  had some depression (I'm generally a very happy person).
23	3739	As well as mood swings.
23	3740	I don't recall any mood swings and I've always been an emotional person.
23	3741	The worst part is the depression and mood swings though.
23	3742	I also experienced extreme mood swings.
23	3743	Its brilliant, its one less thing to worry about,  and about the "mood swings" I use to get really bad PMS but thats really not a issue now ,im probably a little more tearful and sensitive in then i was before i had it put in but its manageable.
23	3744	I got the implant in January of this year I was a hundred and fifty pounds and by the time I got it out in October I was a hundred and seventy I'm having severe mood swings.
23	3745	I bleed constantly, am in a depressed or irritated mood all the time, and when I am in a good mood it never lasts more than a few hours because my mood swings are so horrible.
23	3746	I still get a bit more spots on my face and back then I did before implant,  but my periods are completely gone for almost 1 year now,  which I love and mood swings are back to normal.
23	3747	(Hot flashes, mood swings, cravings..) my periods last 3 weeks and I get them every other month.
23	3748	I never started my period on my own and at the age 17 I was put on BC pills and that  made me pass out so I switched to the depo shot and it made me hurt and very sickish I couldn't eat so I was then convinced by my doctor to go on the nexplanon and it worked up until I couldn't eat again or do anything and my mood swings were horrible...
23	3749	I had horrible anxiety and mood swings.
23	3750	Mood swings worse than when I was pregnant, crying over little things, angry, just not me.
23	3751	Major mood swings and as someone who already suffers from anxiety/depressing, this implant made self management of keeping those at bay, impossible.
23	3752	I will say that I do believe it causes mood swings because I have found myself to be extra emotional for no apparent reason.
23	3753	I've also had mood swings.
23	3754	I've been an emotional wreck the entire time & have had terrible mood swings.
23	3755	I did experience bloating, INSANE mood swings and breakouts though.
23	3756	no mood swings or depression YET.
23	3757	In the first few weeks I also had terrible mood swings, taking them out on my partner felt horrible.
23	3758	I'm already an emotional person since before the implant so I don't want to say it's caused mood swings.
23	3759	However, the mood swings are out of control and i can feel myself getting angry over nothing at times.
23	3760	I started to experience crippling mood swings, I would be driving to work and a song would come on and I would burst into tears.
23	3761	I have had severe mood swings to the point I could choke someone for looking at me the wrong way.
23	3762	I would bleed so much, my mood swings were terrible, the depression was horrible and I would not recommend this to anyone.
23	3763	With this birth control, I have noticed a lot of mood swings.
23	3764	Mood swings are promidant as well.
23	3765	I haven't had too bad of mood swings.
23	3766	I notice more discharge and more mood swings and it's crazy.
23	3767	Constant tiredness and mood swings as well, and in the last week of having it I was feeling sick all the time meaning I had to miss work.
23	3768	For the first 6 months I bled very lightly I needed to use a panty liner it was very annoying so it frustrated me a lot and I had bad mood swings because of this frustration, after taking birth control that my OBGYN prescribed to me while on the nexplanon somehow it stopped the bleeding and my periods went back to normal I didn't have them consistently I probably had 3 periods a year but what I have noticed I've been having very bad facial hair upper lip and Chin I get a wax at least once a week all in all I like the fact that I can't get pregnant but not really liking the side effects it's also very hard to lose weight
23	3769	I have mood swings from hell!
23	3770	I have had the mood swings but to me, that is expected when hormones are altered especially after pregnancy.
23	3771	The only side effect that's really affected me is the mood swings I go from  murderous rage to weepy depression in a matter of moments .
23	3772	I suffer from anxiety and for the first 6 months my mood swings were off the charts.
23	3773	The first couple of months I didn't have a period, but I did have severe mood swings and anxiety.
23	3774	I do get mood swings periodically but nothing bad and it is well worth it.
23	3775	So I got this implant 08/2015 and the first 4 months my periods were normal and first 2 months I had a few mood swings.
23	3776	No mood swings, no bloating, no PMS signs at all.
23	3777	Also, I have hysterical mood swings and find myself depressed and tired more intensely than ever before.

23	3826	I never had any mood swings etc before nexplanon.
23	3827	My depression is worse, and my irrability and mood swings from it is causing friction with my fiancé :( hopefully ensurense covers the cost of taking it out.
23	3828	My mood swings are too.
23	3829	I already have bipolar II and borderline personality disorder, along with generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD, and it's definitely made my mood swings worse (though it is hard to tell because they're already severe, as you can well imagine).
23	3830	Some head aches and some mood swings but not as bad as others.
23	3831	I've also experienced severe depression and mood swings.

23	3926	Mood swings like crazy.
23	3927	My mood swings are horrible and I feel depressed!
23	3928	I feel sorry for my bf cause he has to deal with a gf with mood swings!
23	3929	No mood swings etc.
23	3930	I have had mood swings but those last a day or 2.
23	3931	After a couple months, I began to bleed regularly (every day) and my mood swings were horrible.
23	3932	If you have any history of depression or mood swings I WOULD NOT recommend this birth control.
23	3933	I don't feel any mood swings other than what I would have before so Its just my normal me.
23	3934	Only 3-4 small bleedings in that time, and everything felt great, no mood swings, etc.
23	3935	I had crazy mood swings always emotional and on the verge of crying about any and everything.
23	3936	My mood swings have gotten a lot worse and I'm always tired and don't have the energy to do anything.
23	3937	I had extreme mood swings in previous birth control and high blood pressure so I can't be put on the combo pill, but since being on this I seem to always be smiling and laughing.
23	3938	My mood swings are horrible.
23	3939	And the worst part would be the mood swings.
23	3940	5 pounds in the first week and over 15 since, not to mention the awful mood swings, I have never had a history of depression but while on it I would randomly feel miserable, like the hopeless kind of depression, I broke out and just generally wanted to crawl out of my skin, I had it removed yesterday, felt the same as going in and I'm hopeful my body will return to normal with time.
23	3941	never had a problem with my skin or mood swings...now been 25 and just after having my second one inserted I think their brilliant not for everyone by the looks of these reviews but me and my boyfriend of 2 years swear by it only negative is its very expensive if your insurance doesn'tt cover it
23	3942	It has made me turn into a psycho bitch with crazy mood swings.
23	3943	I actually lost a few pounds which is nice and I haven't had terrible mood swings (I pretty much haven't had any to be honest).
23	3944	Mood swings are insane crazy.
23	3945	I did have a little mood swings at first but they subsided.
23	3946	Mood swings I'm always crying or angry.
23	3947	The negative side effects I've seen have been some break outs on my face, mild mood swings and irritability.
23	3948	The only side effect that I've really noticed is my mood swings.
23	3949	In the first few months, I had mood swings (irritability, anger, sadness), but that passed.
23	3950	I've also witness mood swings and depression.
23	3951	At almost the 3 year mark she started having really bad anxiety, panic attacks, mood swings, depression.
23	3952	My daughter was the happiest most out going person and now can not get out of bed, bad mood swings, anxiety, panic attacks are overwhelming, can't eat has lost about 25 pounds in a week can't sleep and suicide.
23	3953	Now I haven't bled any since I've had it inserted but the mood swings have been horrifying.
23	3954	Hopefully nothing changes besides the mood swings getting better.
23	3955	As far as mood swings I have them real bad.
23	3956	Mood swings are minimal if not non-existent feel more laid back than usual and have an appetite for food and my boyfriend which is more than I could ask for (: Recommend !!!!!!!
23	3957	So I got the implant on April 15 and immediately I started feeling mood swings , one moment I felt happy the next mad .
23	3958	I haven't had any problems with mood swings, depression nothing like that.If anything it has improved my mood.
23	3959	I'm also experiencing the WORST mood swings EVER.
23	3960	I have had mild mood swings that I didn't even realize until I read other reviews.
23	3961	I have started waking up stupidly early (no matter what time I go to bed) with terrible feelings of anxiety (despite never suffering this ever before)...and am very tearful and have mood swings.
23	3962	It has also caused terrible depression and mood swings.
23	3963	My mood swings have been through the roof!
23	3964	I took my nexplanon out 3 days ago and skin is back to normal almost perfect and no mood swings.
23	3965	I have intense mood swings where within 5 minutes I'll change from excited to hating everything for no reason.
23	3966	I decided to try Nexplanon because the Depo Provera gave me mood swings and longer periods.
23	3967	I believe I had some mood swings for a few weeks in the beginning.
23	3968	The downfalls are: mood swings a week before period begins (unreasonably sad with no reasons whatsoever), irregular bleeding (no idea when it will come,  brown at beginning then heavy), long lasting periods (like a month), and when it was inserted my doctor hit a vital nerve causing me to faint.
23	3969	Previously had PMDD that included panic attacks, depression, oversleeping, mood swings, binge eating etc.
23	3970	Not been on for long but mainly got it for PMDD symptoms - which are very similar to the mood swings effects of Nexplanon.
23	3971	I was pregnant for 6 weeks before I got the implant and the slight mood swings are nothing compared to my awful pregnancy hormones.
23	3972	However I have had severe mood swings.
23	3973	In the beginning, I had a horrible time with the nonstop bleeding and the crazy mood swings but stuck through it and now everything is clear blue skies!
23	3974	I did have mood swings in the first few weeks but nothing out of control.
23	3975	I haven't noticed any more mood swings than normal, I am a teenager and that teds to happen a lot anyway.
23	3976	I've had no period, no mood swings, and it did not affect my milk supply.
23	3977	My side affects are: mood swings, depression, I sleep a lot more, and I eat like a grown man fresh out of prison.
23	3978	Four days ago I felt symptoms come back even worse; experiencing mood swings, manic depression, suicidal thoughts, back pain, anxiety, heavy period.
23	3979	I would say it does cause a good bit of mood swings.
23	3980	Its insertion was painless (only a little bit of soreness in the following days) I did have some mood swings for the first couple of weeks but now it is totally fine!
23	3981	I get very bad mood swings, I also get depressed sometimes.
23	3982	I've also experienced the mood swings and mild depression.
23	3983	ive read about mood swings... yeah, well im always moody.
23	3984	In the first 3 weeks or so I developed extremely greasy hair and horrible mood swings.
23	3985	My only real complaints about this are the mood swings.
23	3986	I think the biggest problem I have faced is the emotional and hardness of my mood swings.
23	3987	No mood swings whatsoever...so far so good.
23	3988	Although I could go without the mood swings and depressed feelings at times.
23	3989	Now, my skin is clearer, I don't have mood swings anymore.
23	3990	The highs/lows of my mood swings left me feeling like I was losing my mind.
23	3991	My mood swings have been horrible & I can't stop eating.
23	3992	My mood swings are horrible & I cry for no reason (my poor husband).
23	3993	I rated this birth control a nine because I have experienced some crazzzy mood changes, but it was only for the first 2 weeks!
23	3994	In the beginning I had the typical mood changes, temporary increased appetite and 2 weeks after the insertion I had a light period that lasted about a week.
23	3995	I have noticed mood changes but didn't think anything of it until I felt like I couldn't get out of this state of sadness.
23	3996	I went to ER to get anxiety medicine to try to control this crazy mood changes.
23	3997	I will be getting this thing out ASAP, I feel like my mood changes are on a downward spiral.
23	3998	I had not noticed anything, but my mother and partner immediately noticed mood changes.
23	3999	My only discrepancy with it is that you go through stages of depression and your mood changes constantly.
23	4000	And about the mood changes.
23	4001	I haven't had any mood changes like some people have on the implant, and I have noticed no change in weight, in fact it has gone down a bit.
23	4002	My mood changes so quickly.
23	4003	I have experienced mood changes, somewhat of a depression and immense fatigue at times.
23	4004	My mood changed drastically due to the hormones and I wanted it out as soon as possible.
23	4005	My mood changed completely.
23	4006	However, my mood changed drastically.
23	4007	Coming up on removal & replacement date... a little nervous but I'm sure it will be a piece of cake.
23	4008	On this birth control I became very nervous all the time and was extremely sensitive.
23	4009	I have been off the medication for about 2 weeks now and have not cried or been nervous once.
23	4010	When I first got it, I read all the horror stories and bad reviews and was very nervous.
23	4011	I was nervous because of all these bad reviews, everyone is different but just give it a try, please.
23	4012	A little nervous that nothing will change and that I'm actually just crazy!
23	4013	Like most people, I was extremely nervous about the procedure to get this birth control inserted.
23	4014	I had watched multiple youtube videos on the process and was extremely nervous.
23	4015	My face has been swollen too (my friend called me a hamster), I started to be moody and nervous, all my muscles and joints started to pain.
23	4016	I was anxious,  nervous,  irritable,  on edge,  and emotional.
23	4017	I've had the implant in for about three months now, at first I was very nervous about it since I've heard many horror stories about how it will make you bleed for a month straight, however, it isn't too bad.
23	4018	I was extremely nervous and skeptical about getting this ESPECIALLY after reading all the terrible reviews, so I thought I would share my positive experience.
23	4019	It does make u nervous because it makes u wonder if you're pregnant.
23	4020	But the Nexplanon does its job, just makes me nervous because without my period, i don't know if I'm pregnant especially with the way that it mimics pregnancy symptoms.
23	4021	I was nervous all the time.
23	4022	I will admit I was very nervous about getting it done but I had a normal period as usual the first two months.
23	4023	I was nervous because I'm scared of needles but I didn't feel a thing.
23	4024	Only downside is I haven't had a period in 2 months and reading the other reviews I'm nervous to know when I will get one, or if I even will.
23	4025	I was nervous about getting it inserted but the whole process is a breeze, so if you are considering it don't worry about that!
23	4026	It makes me nervous not having a period, but it's apparently super effective.
23	4027	When the Dr first put it on me I was super nervous but it was a short sting.
23	4028	I was nervous about the constant bleeding, as a lot of people reported, but only had a period for ten days than nothing since then.
23	4029	I was nervous about getting the implant based on bad reviews, but I'm glad I did.
23	4030	I was nervous since I had so much pain with the insertion.
23	4031	Ladies, I want to make sure all of you know that birth control works differently with every woman, and most reviews online are from negative experiences, for I was so nervous to get this inserted because of all the negative online reviews.
23	4032	I was nervous about getting a hormonal birth control birth control.
23	4033	I'm nervous about what other side effects will come, but I just needed to share this.
23	4034	I was a bit nervous at first I thought my arm would never be the same.
23	4035	It also gave me nervousness to the point where I felt like I was internally shaking, as well as shaking on the outside.
23	4036	It's the most effective form out right now and has eased my nervousness about pregnancy.
23	4037	The last six months periods are painful, hard to lose weight, I am extremely moody, anxious, and depressed.
23	4038	Had nexplanon put in a month ago been feeling very depressed and anxious.
23	4039	Two years ago I was put on a new pill and I noticed I was super hormonal, angry, depressed, anxious, stressed, etc.
23	4040	No weight change, I don't feel moody, anxious, or depressed (like i did on Levora) so it's currently amazeballs.
23	4041	I have became more anxious and irrationally angry.
23	4042	I have irregular bleeding that lasts weeks sometime, I've been feeling more depressed, sensitive, anxious and moody.
23	4043	I would cry over nothing, or get anxious or fearful.
23	4044	I'm anxious to see what next month's cycle will be like.
23	4045	I also feel that I'm always moody and anxious.
23	4046	I became EXTREMELY anxious.
23	4047	Let me just start with this: I'm an extremely anxious person.
23	4048	I have spent the last 2 months trying to figure out why I feel so angry at the drop of a hat and why being around people makes me anxious.
23	4049	I'm already an anxious person but nothing I can't handle or deal with.
23	4050	My period started back today and I'm anxious to see how long it lasts!
23	4051	I have increased energy and haven't been anxious in weeks when I would have daily anxiety attacks before.
23	4052	I'm depressed, anxious, and full of angst.
23	4053	At first,  I think it made me really anxious (which did not help with how much stress I was going through the following month.)
23	4054	Sex was embarrassing and my mood was horrible felt depressed and anxious all the time.
23	4055	Coffee, tea, or even Excedrin were making me feel anxious.
23	4056	But shortly afterwards I began to get stressed, anxious, irritable, and angry.
23	4057	Completely forget it's even in my arm most of the time, however my moods are horrendous, I cry far more than I ever used to, I snap at people and I never used to, I feel very anxious or conscious and often feel exhausted.
23	4058	BUT it has made me super anxious and emotional.
23	4059	I am extremely irritable and anxious.
23	4060	I started feeling anxious all the time and I don't want to get out of bed some days or even do any of my normal daily activities.
23	4061	In 1 month, I felt irritable and anxious.
23	4062	I suffer from major depression on it, and major anxiety.
23	4063	The severe depression and anxiety is outrageous.
23	4064	During the first week I noticed my anxiety spiked up.
23	4065	My depression and anxiety  got so horrible that I thought I was going  crazy .
23	4066	I haven’t  experienced  bleeding but my anxiety is out of control.
23	4067	It's made my skin break out so much worse and has made me start to get blemishes on my back and shoulders, but worst of all I have noticed a giant spike in anxiety and depression, to the point of suicidal thoughts and almost a suicide attempt.
23	4068	I am undiagnosed and always had social anxiety, but it got remarkably unbearable after the insertion, I plan on getting it out this year.
23	4069	I would not recommend if you have history with anxiety or depression
23	4070	I have become insecure about my weight and I no longer can drink caffeinated beverages to often because it sets off my anxiety that I never had before this bc.
23	4071	I had a lot of anxiety about it but I knew it was right for me and that was what was the most important.
23	4072	No period but had anxiety an depression worsen.
23	4073	My anxiety is unchanged.
23	4074	I haven't noticed any major mood or appetite changes  (I've already been diagnosed with anxiety and depression).
23	4075	My friend and I both have ADHD and have had previous situational anxiety.
23	4076	I actually lost weight because of high anxiety.
23	4077	My anxiety has also been off the charts crazy since the first day I got it in.
23	4078	In June 2016 I got diagnosed with major depression and anxiety, which I have never struggled with before.
23	4079	Prior to that for about 2 weeks I was so depressed I didn't want to get out of bed, I already have been clinically diagnosed with depression and anxiety and nexplanon made it worse.
23	4080	I get depression and anxiety a lot.
23	4081	Nexplanon is horrible if you already suffer from depression or anxiety.
23	4082	My Dr. put it in my arm without going over the fact that it has much more side effects, especially for me who already has anemia, low blood sugar, severe depression & anxiety, etc.
23	4083	I did however experience severe anxiety but I've always had it so I don't think it was due to the nexplanon.
23	4084	I go through 2 week periods of feeling completely myself and then suddenly drop into these phases of chronic anxiety and exhaustion.
23	4085	I  have intrusive thoughts that do not help my anxiety in the slightest and I just feel so isolated from everyone.
23	4086	I did have to see a dr and get the anxiety and depression sorted, which I think went along with untreated post partum depression for both of my girls.
23	4087	As far as anxiety and depression.
23	4088	I did notice my anxiety was horrendous at first but I spoke to my psychiatrist and he put me on some additional medication.
23	4089	My depression and anxiety have gone through the roof and I'm always tired but can't sleep.
23	4090	I have had it in for over two months now and it has caused depression, anxiety, and me to bleed every single day.
23	4091	The implant was inserted about 1 month ago in efforts to alleviate the depression and anxiety I feel the pill caused.
23	4092	I had a past of severe anxiety, and it made it even worse unfortunately.
23	4093	I get separation anxiety when he's gone and  whenever he is not home, I start crying when he doesn't get home on time.
23	4094	I've had major depression, thoughts of dying, my anxiety has also been through the roof!
23	4095	And anxiety are the worst they have ever been.
23	4096	I already struggled with depression and this made my moods totally unstable and made my depression and anxiety symptoms skyrocket.
23	4097	My anxiety shot through the roof.
23	4098	I am tired, depressed, and get bad anxiety.
23	4099	Never have had issues with depression, anxiety.
23	4100	Full blown anxiety attacks and sleepless nights.
23	4101	It started with anxiety me and my boyfriend have been together for about 8 months now and ever since I've been on it it's totally screwed everything up.
23	4102	I could control the anxiety until the depression came it got worse from there.
23	4103	I've had great experience with this except I have extreme anxiety and depression which I am on medications for that now.
23	4104	I have dealt with anxiety and slight depression in the past and it almost feels like Nexplanon mellowed my hormones out.
23	4105	My anxiety is off the charts.
23	4106	It has made my depression and anxiety so much worse.
23	4107	I got this inserted and had to have it removed after a month...DO NOT get this if you already have some anxiety.
23	4108	Please girls if you don't want to be big and have no period, depression have bad anxiety, be tired 24/7 don't get it or the depo.
23	4109	My depression and anxiety are clearing.
23	4110	It made my anxiety so so so much worse ( so bad I was hospitalized for it).
23	4111	Not to mention it has caused me to have crippling anxiety and depression.
23	4112	I've had a long history of depression and anxiety, but this medicine in no way affected that.
23	4113	I am someone who suffers from unbalanced hormones (had no idea until after insertion) and because of that I have anxiety, depression, and also other problems.
23	4114	After Nexplanon I felt very balanced out.. My anxiety went down so much and I wasn't as depressed.
23	4115	I have been using it since January 2017 and till now which is March and I have had the worst emotional side affects severe depression and anxiety.
23	4116	I've had bad depression and anxiety and I haven't had ANY periods at all...
23	4117	I suffered terrible anxiety.
23	4118	I have severe anxiety and depression.
23	4119	I've had the Nexplanon implant in for 7 weeks and within 2 days of having it in I started to experience extreme anxiety to the point of experiencing horrific panic attack's each day!
23	4120	In addition, my mood is different I feel depression, extreme anxiety, and have an attitude.
23	4121	But by the 4th month I started feeling depressed, very moody, episodes of anxiety, would cry for no reason.
23	4122	My anxiety has recently flared slightly but other birth control pills have been worse.
23	4123	I never experienced any weight issues but the fact that it exaggerated my anxiety and depression I never want to eat, or get up and be apart of the world.
23	4124	It would be an absolute dream if it didn't give me constant anxiety attacks.
23	4125	The downside of it is it makes my anxiety a thousand times worse.
23	4126	I've held off thinking I'll get over it it'll get better but it never does and with my anxiety being so bad I never wanted to call my doctor.
23	4127	I already suffered from anxiety and depression that I was managing just fine on my own with homeopathic remedies.
23	4128	I have anxiety attacks everyday it seems like.
23	4129	I thought I was in bad shape, but now thinking back and doing the math my depression and anxiety have only gotten 29383x worse since I've been on this.
23	4130	However I've noticed a significant increase monthly of severe depression and anxiety.
23	4131	Overall, I  did not get pregnant, but I will not take a chance on taking this if you want to have depression and anxiety like I do.
23	4132	My anxiety levels were also elevated and I didn't know what ever cause for this to happen.
23	4133	Do not choose this method if you are already a overly sensitive person or may have any depression or anxiety, I would not recommend this.
23	4134	After I insert it, it took me about 5/6 months to realize that the medicine caused me to become more sensitive, suffer depression and anxiety.
23	4135	No more depression, anxiety I'm back to normal!
23	4136	I already have anxiety, and the Nexplanon Implant has only increased this in me.
23	4137	During the first month especially, I had panic attacks and anxiety, unlike anything I ever experienced before.
23	4138	I have depression and anxiety and I didn't notice any changes with that or significantly with my weight.
23	4139	I got really depressed, my anxiety increased, and it just made my personality change.
23	4140	I have always had anxiety but I personally feel that the nexplanon is making it worse and I was diagnosed with IBS (for the pain and stomach upset/anxiety).
23	4141	tbh everything is actually really awesome however, my moods & anxiety are ABSOLUTELY terrible.
23	4142	I have had anxiety issues & currently take medicine, but lord, this is severe.
23	4143	I don't have severe anxiety but I did when I  first had it inserted.
23	4144	I've had depression and anxiety on and off my whole life but I have never felt this bad.
23	4145	Leaving the house would just give me anxiety.
23	4146	If you already have a bit of anxiety without it do not get it!
23	4147	I had it in for a year and suffered from more severe depression and anxiety than ever before.
23	4148	I got it removed two weeks ago and my anxiety has literally decreased so much.
23	4149	I feel so much anxiety since I got it.
23	4150	I thought my depression and anxiety was because I lost my baby.
23	4151	maybe increased anxiety?
23	4152	I already have anxiety disorder so tricky to tell
23	4153	I cried everyday, had severe anxiety, depressed.
23	4154	My anxiety is reduced significantly.
23	4155	I got the match stick implant inserted 10/13/14 and now it's 8/14/16 , and as far as pregnancy It's amazing with keeping under control , you can you use protection or not and never worry about pregnancy ( but I suggest using protection) but I have never had bad anxiety before but recently it's been crippling and I have no idea why and in heading it's because of this birth control.
23	4156	I would take out this sadness and anxiety on my boyfriend, who luckily is very understanding and put up with me.
23	4157	I have had anxiety and depression prior to use, it has not gotten any worse.
23	4158	Along with that I have anxiety which I never had before, depression, and sometimes it feels like a panic attack.
23	4159	It gave me awful anxiety and daily panic attacks.
23	4160	Before I was on nexplannon I did not have anxiety problem.
23	4161	I have experienced the worse lung crushing anxiety while having nexplannon.
23	4162	already had anxiety before it, can now add severe depression to that.
23	4163	My anxiety and depression levels are so high.
23	4164	Unfortunately because I have anxiety already this hormone made it really hard for me to live normally.
23	4165	Mostly because of the bleeding and my terrible anxiety for this implant.
23	4166	My doctor even wanted to put me on an anxiety med.
23	4167	However anxiety and depression have worsened towards the end.
23	4168	And I never had anxiety before this.
23	4169	My periods are lighter, and it gives me a peace of mind, lIke i never have anxiety anymore.
23	4170	I already have depression and anxiety and this is most certainly not helping.
23	4171	Now having the rod in my arm for 2 years, I have experienced major anxiety, depression, and mood swings.As most other young adults, working parttime and going to school parttime can cause a lot a stress on a person.. at first I thought it was normal and every other person was experiencing the same stress as me..
23	4172	My anxiety has really spiked as well as depression.
23	4173	My anxiety is worse than ever and my depression I thought I had been cured of is slowly getting worse and worse.
23	4174	My mood has been all over the map and the anxiety and depression is more than I can take.
23	4175	Also, I have had the worst anxiety and I have never had anxiety in my life.
23	4176	I've had extreme depression, anxiety, paranoia, I no longer trust my boyfriend, I've been having suicidal thoughts, some days I can't get out of bed, I feel insane, I'm not myself, l became very antisocial.
23	4177	I now have a foggy thought process and have a hard time making decisions as well as anxiety and slight depression- which I've never EVER had before.
23	4178	My anxiety is so intense I can hardly drive anywhere.
23	4179	It is making my depression and anxiety so much worse.
23	4180	I've also experienced anxiety and through myself into panic attacks.
23	4181	I have also had extreme anxiety issues.
23	4182	I seem to have an anxiety attack over the littlest things.
23	4183	At first it seemed fine I felt great and then a week or so went by and I was overthinking everything, became extremely stressed, and keep having anxiety attacks.
23	4184	Also developed bad anxiety and a ton of depersonalization bouts.
23	4185	I have depression, anxiety irrability.
23	4186	I been on nexplaonon  for a year now an this is worst birthcontrol every my periods last up to 2 weeks an I have bad anxiety attack were it feels like I can't breath or catch my breath  an  never sleepy I'm always up at night an,don't go to sleep until the afternoon I getting it remove asap
23	4187	My depression and anxiety have gotten worse but I'm not completely sure if that is because of this birthcontrol.
23	4188	Never had anxiety attacks before, do now.
23	4189	Very horrible and side affects always sleepy, shortness of breath, and anxiety.
23	4190	My anxiety was severe and I had begun feeling extreme sadness and depression.
23	4191	I've had horrible anxiety and easily angered.
23	4192	I overreact and my depression and anxiety are horrible.
23	4193	I really thought this was a nifty bc because it lasts for years with no worry of replacement or missing a dose , however my depression worsened and I developed anxiety problems in the time I have been on it .
23	4194	But my depression and anxiety sky rocketed.
23	4195	I FEEL blood clots sludge up and down my arteries sometimes, limb pain, depression, anxiety, and groggyness, which all are very unnatural for me.
23	4196	I also get bad chest pain from time to time and my anxiety has been at an all time high
23	4197	Panic attacks/ anxiety.
23	4198	Finally the stomach problems stopped, but I began having anxiety and slight depression.
23	4199	It got to the point I didn't know how to cope cause I've NEVER had anxiety OR depression.
23	4200	My anxiety hit sky high.
23	4201	The worst part of this was the anxiety worsening depression.
23	4202	I've always been very outgoing which I still am but I have developed severe anxiety, and a bit of depression.
23	4203	My anxiety and depression have gone through the roof and I can barely perform daily tasks anymore.
23	4204	I have a history of depression and anxiety but haven't noticed any increase in symptoms for the past 14 months.
23	4205	I have developed depression, and I have had several anxiety attacks.
23	4206	Nobody explained to me the negative side effects it could have on people, i had such bad anxiety I never left my house, I used to stay up all night just crying but I didn't know why.
23	4207	I developed anxiety.
23	4208	After about three months with it in I started to get depressed and have anxiety attacks 24/7.
23	4209	My anxiety is so bad that it has caused 24/7 depersonalization.
23	4210	I have been having anxiety attacks out of nowhere.
23	4211	Ive had crazy anxiety and severe depressed moods, lost a few pounds, socially limited myself, & lethargic.
23	4212	It is very helpful with not getting pregnant but if you have anxiety it makes it 100 x worse.
23	4213	Since having the implant I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and intolerable anger issues, which I won't blame completely on the implant but if anything it enhanced it enough to be put on medication, which I needed before hand just never went on.
23	4214	i suffer from general anxiety disorder and have bouts of depression and it seems like since starting it's all gotten worse!
23	4215	I had to get prescribed an anxiety medication but I don't have to take it all the time.
23	4216	I also have very mild breast pain, nothing unbearable.
23	4217	breast pain and tenderness , painful periods at times.
23	4218	I had regular periods the first year and this July will be be the 3rd year and I've been on the birth control nexplanon but I've bleeding for 3 to 4 weeks straight  each month with no one day stop no breaks at all, I feel weak all the time, constant breast pain , and constant back pain
23	4219	The second day and today I've had some breast pain but nothing too bad.
23	4220	Lately my problem has been extreme breast pain.
23	4221	I have breast tenderness once a month.
23	4222	Sex is also extremely painful, i have breast tenderness, and at one point it gave me vaginitis.
23	4223	Right now I'm just experiencing breast tenderness & although it is really uncomfortable, I'm sure being pregnant would feel worse!
23	4224	No pain with insertion, normal periods (maybe one day longer total), slight breast tenderness, no noticeable change in sex drive/weight/attitude.
23	4225	It's extremely heavy, painful, tender breasts.
23	4226	Downfall: extremely tender breasts and a little discomfort at insertion site .
23	4227	Also felt like constant PMS -  bloating, sore breasts, back ache.
23	4228	Small side effects, sore breasts, a bit tired.
23	4229	Sometimes I have sore breasts but it's all worth it!
23	4230	On the pill ai had sore breasts.
23	4231	Nexaplanon made gain weight, bleed for a month at a time, cost me hundreds of dollars in tampons & pads, caused a yeast infection and completely changed by personality (caused depression and horrible anger spells), it affected my relationships with everyone I know.
23	4232	A few weeks go by and I'm experiencing horrible vaginitis (inflammation of the vulva area) that turned into a yeast infection.
23	4233	Again, I get an over counter yeast infection creams and I'm fine.
23	4234	I would have a period that would last anywhere from a month to a month and a half and then about 3 days of no bleeding but a yeast infection.
23	4235	Also, ever since having the implant I've had thrush (yeast infection) about 3 times, and the doctors say it can't be because of the implant however I'm certain it is.
23	4236	got a yeast infection because constant bleeding threw off my pH balance.
23	4237	In addition to this I think I have the first yeast infection I've gotten in my life, and I'm much more irritable than usual.
23	4238	I changed from depo to nexplanon because I was having recurring yeast infection I also developed depression but now that I have nexplanon my depression has worsened my doctor prescribed me medicine for depression but the dosage was just up and instead of yeast infections I keep getting bv even though it's suppose to stop pregnancy I still have Symptoms of a pregnant lady I don't have a period I have horrible pain in my lower stomach like I'm having my period
23	4239	My boyfriend and I used to have sex about 4 times a week and now it's down to maybe once a month if I don't have a yeast infection.
23	4240	Right after getting it, I got a bad yeast infection.
23	4241	Yeast infections, moodiness, depression and numbness in fingers were my side effects.
23	4242	Fewer yeast infections.
23	4243	I have had it for about 8 months now and I have had vaginal, bacterial and yeast infections off and on no matter how many times I get them treated, they always come back, I have painful urination, painful sex, pain in the stomach during sex and more.
23	4244	Constant yeast infections and didn't know why.
23	4245	Increase in yeast infections, vaginal dryness.
23	4246	I read up on it and it said that one of the side effects was vaginitis this is not good very painful
23	4247	It has completely killed my sex life- not to mention the fact that I have been getting recurrent vaginitis since starting it.
23	4248	I thought it could still be post partum lochia , but now I'm not sure reading that a side effect from nexplanon could be vaginitis.
24	1	Caused me to have cystic acne after 5 months.
24	2	Starting in January, it was great, I was mostly acne free and wasn't having too many mood swings.
24	3	At about June, my acne became cystic, extremely painful and I could barely move my face without pain.
24	4	I already have issues with depression and acne and have heard good things from other's who had normally suffered from these things and that the ring changed their life.
24	5	And I have a handful of new cystic acne in weird places beyond my face.
24	6	The positives were I didn't have to think about it everyday and normally I have acne but on nuva ring I didn't experience break outs.
24	7	It has made my skin very clear and acne free and my breasts are bigger.
24	8	No acne, no mood swings, no weight gain.
24	9	It regulated my periods and made them short and light, cleared up my acne, and has effectively prevented pregnancy.
24	10	I tried it again a few months later hoping it would be different but I spotted for the whole month, I got acne, and my moods took a dip again.
24	11	I thought my acne subsided for good by senior year of high school but I'm now 21 and experiencing major cystic acne again.
24	12	The first month was great aside from acne and stomach cramps.
24	13	On top of the acne and stomach cramps, I was very sensitive during intercourse, I was unable to sleep and had horrible dreams every night.
24	14	No acne, no itchiness, some slight mood swings but I've gained weight and my sex drive is gooone.I was on beyaz before but switched because my new insurance company didn't cover beyaz.
24	15	My acne is worse.
24	16	The very first side effect I noticed was acne.
24	17	I've never had acne before until I started this.
24	18	Didn't effect acne or my sex drive.
24	19	ZERO weight gain, no acne (in fact my skin is clearer than it was before being on the NuvaRing), no mood swings, no decrease in sex drive etc.
24	20	Here is the best part: it has cleared up my severe cystic acne completely and my skin stays 100% consistently clear while I'm on it.
24	21	As someone who has struggled with acne, this is huge for me.
24	22	The pill gave me bad body acne and cystic acne which NuvaRing cleared up.
24	23	I previously had the arm implant, but the hormones caused cystic acne and irregular bleeding.
24	24	It cleared up my face of acne, I didn't gain any weight, it shortened my period to be about 3 days long and is very light, no extra moodiness or anxiety.
24	25	Nuva really worked with my schedule.The downfall is that my face broke out with cystic acne (which is extremely painful).
24	26	Pros: less acne, birth control, easy to use - you don't have to think about it a lot.
24	27	Overall, good for acne and regulating the period but not worth the emotional instability and sex drive effects.
24	28	I have had about a four pound weight gain (I attribute it to my eating habits), increased moodiness, and my acne has progressively worsened.
24	29	My acne cleared up but I did gain a little weight but nothing crazy.
24	30	Within 3 months of going on it my acne got significantly worse, but then completely cleared up in 5-6 months!
24	31	When I went off of it my acne (which was nonexistent before) popped up like crazy!
24	32	I already get migraines and have acne but I do notice I don't get migraines as often now.
24	33	It doesn't do anything different to me such as acne or weight gain.
24	34	Sex drive is good, acne cleared up for the most part, no discomfort, & no weight gain.
24	35	Postives: my skin cleared up, I have bad acne around my jawline and it made it all dissapear.
24	36	I had no acne, my sex drive not affected on or off It.
24	37	Other than that, I'm completely normal; no acne, no mood change, no weight gain, nothing.
24	38	I have been on the NuvaRing for 2 years and I absolutely love it, I have no worries towards a pregnancy, it controlled my severe acne, but my attitude changed a bit (controllable), with intercourse I find myself dry as well as painful at the beginning but my partner doesn't notice it.
24	39	I am sure this is a great method for other people, like it clears up acne and shortens periods.
24	40	On the other hand I have broken out what feels like everywhere, I've never had a problem with acne before.
24	41	After consistently being on nuva ring for over a year, I left it out for a month, so I had no birth control, and within that month my acne cleared up so I assume that the birth control is causing me to breakout more than I should.
24	42	On the plus side I do like that I don't have to keep switching it out, and I have definitely seen alot of improvement in my acne.
24	43	Its great only downside is, it doesn't help with acne so I might just have to change but I am really considering it very hard because I honestly love this form of contraception.
24	44	Intense vaginal irritation to say the very least and no change to my acne, it's been bad for as long as I can remember.
24	45	I went off of it twice for month or two at a time, and during those times, my acne came back a little (not bad because my skin is naturally pretty clear when not PMSing/on my period, but was visible nonetheless), and I was actually more emotional, had a lower libido, etc.
24	46	In reality it does wonders for acne, & is so convenient but everyone is different.
24	47	I haven't gained or loss any wieght or I have not braken out in acne or anything although I have never had that probelm.. so for now I would recommend it to anyone but if I do have problems I will change that rating!
24	48	I didn't have any other major side effects other than it made my face explode with hormonal acne.
24	49	I had very mild acne and it got worse every month that I used the ring.
24	50	I switched to Beyaz and I have zero side effects and my acne is 80% better after a week.
24	51	I was on the NuvaRing for about 6 months, and I noticed extreme breast tenderness, increased acne and the worst part was the 15lb weight gain.
24	52	This will be my third month on Nuva ring and I am having really bad headaches and acne problems.
24	53	I haven't gained any weight from the pill, but my acne issue has been worse since I have used the ring.
24	54	Prior to getting on the ring, I had moderate acne, and after a month of being on this, it cleared the acne up completely.
24	55	I had really heavy bleeding for 7 days to the point I became anemic due to the blood loss and the NuvaRing has changed my period to being very light and lasting at most 5 days and reduced my previously awful acne.
24	56	Pros: ease of use, decreased acne, reduced headaches which was wonderful.
24	57	My breasts have grown at least half a cup size and while my acne isn't gone it's lightened considerably.
24	58	No acne only side effect is that I can't keep anything down all I want to eat is fruits and salads, my doctor said it was normal and that maybe this will help with the anxiety I had before.
24	59	I have not gained weight, it has helped clear my acne and I am not pregnant, so it works.
24	60	I don't have much acne, light short periods.
24	61	No weight gain or acne but I would trade that for my normal sex life back.
24	62	It's so easy it is to use and it's been extremely effective; not just in the obvious prevention of pregnancy, but also with controlling my acne and maintaing my weight; No moodiness, no depression.
24	63	Birth control pills make me extremely nauseous, & the shot made me gain a ton of weight & caused bad acne, so the only method I can use consistently is the Nuvaring.
24	64	No acne, no remembering to take it everyday, no worrying, no cramps, light periods.
24	65	Unfortunately my acne came back (much to my dismay) when I stopped using it, but for me the NuvaRing was still not worth the side effects.
24	66	I have never had acne in my life, and I now have severe acne along my jawline and hairline, and chest.
24	67	I was concerned about how Nuvaring would affect my tendency to acne and am pleasantly surprised that it is working the same as most pills and I have not had a problem with acne.
24	68	These include severe cystic acne, 12 lb weight gain, headaches, nausea, and my mood swings have worsened.
24	69	I normally have no extreme problems with PMS, acne or mood swings.
24	70	I used NuvaRing for 2 and a half years, the first 2 years were WONDERFUL, not a single problem; or bleeding or spotting, periods were regular no mood swings or acne no depression or loss of sex drive, I gained maybe 5-10 lbs but to be honest I don't eat very healthy.
24	71	It works great for the whole "not getting pregnant" thing, but my acne is the worst it's ever been, and my migraines are hell.
24	72	My acne is cleared and I've lost a few pounds too.
24	73	Also has cleared up my acne!
24	74	Loved that I didn't have to think about the pill, but I started to get very bad cystic acne on my face, then head and bikini line.
24	75	If you start to get severe acne by the third month on the ring, visit your doctor to switch birth control methods.
24	76	After one month, I ended up with the worst acne on my back and chest that I have ever had in my life.
24	77	The acne was so bad, I almost thought it was a reaction.
24	78	I didn't have any other side effects besides the acne, but acne isn't something I can deal with.
24	79	I did notice in the beginning a little bit of acne but that was expected for the first month according to my Dr.
24	80	I'm taking it to control my hormonal mood swings and acne.
24	81	The first 3 days, my sex drive was through the roof, mood swings gone but bloating instantly but then 5 days - a week later, bloating, depressed, angry mood swings, acne has gotten 10x worse especially on my back, weight/water gain, and now a week and half later I have cramps randomly.
24	82	Less acne, less pain too.
24	83	I had symptoms from weight gain, mood swings, acne, debilitating cramps, and even serious depression.
24	84	And the worst thing was this terrible rash on my forehead that looked like tiny acne.
24	85	No acne, weight gain, mood swings, or nausea.
24	86	It improved my acne a lot, that was something I have been struggling with since I was a teenager.
24	87	The shot was a nightmare, gave me horrible back acne and made me totally nuts.
24	88	When I had enough I went back to the Nuvaring and I felt normal again and my back acne went away.
24	89	My acne cleared up, though I do break out when I get my period.
24	90	I have never had an issue with weight gain or acne.
24	91	No weight gain, no acne, no noticeable change in my sex-drive, etc.
24	92	Years ago I had been on the patch form of birth control and had enjoyed the way it shortened my periods and cleared my acne, so after a few years of being on no hormones and dealing with long periods with cramps and some acne again I decided to try Nuvaring.
24	93	I have a extremely high metabolism and have acne.
24	94	My acne has also been clearing up (I had it all over my chest and back).
24	95	Bad acne which I've never had before.
24	96	As for acne, I didn't notice any change in my skin.
24	97	I was previously on Lo-ovral, but after my gastric bypass, my body wouldn't absorb the pill correctly, giving me acne, mood swings, and breakthrough bleeding.
24	98	I never really thought I was very acne prone when I started it.
24	99	However, I had to go off of it due to insurance issues for 3 months and my acne EXPLODED like it never has before in my life.
24	100	Once I got back on the ring, the acne and greasiness went away.
24	101	NO acne, bigger breasts, don't have to take every day, only 4 periods a year, helped my mood swings etc.
24	102	There is also: discharge, acne, nausea and stomach cramping/bloating.
24	103	I feel like I'm on my period all the time and the acne (like a kid).
24	104	Noticeable side effects: much more weepy, I cry over the most ridiculous things, breasts got bigger (one good thing), much much more prone to acne, so I have to watch what I eat, my sex drive has officially died.
24	105	I didn't gain any weight or get acne.
24	106	I've noticed an increase in acne along my jawline around my withdrawal week, and I have a predictable headache during that week as well.
24	107	I've been struggling with acne for a long time and I am on the middle of my second month and my skin is almost perfectly clear.
24	108	No acne, (not a huge sufferer of acne normally), no painful cramps (yet) I got on the NuvaRing immediately after getting off the Depo Provera.
24	109	But the cons of the ring have been pretty bad - horrible acne (painful bumps, cystic acne on chin/jam), depression, moodiness, crying, trouble focusing, vaginal dryness and discharge, abdominal bloating, etc.
24	110	With OTHER pills, I have had weight gain (not in my breasts unfortunately), acne, moodiness, lack of sex drive, spotting, periods that lasted forever etc.
24	111	No weight gain, no mood swings, no acne.
24	112	Have slight acne breakout.
24	113	My first month on NuvaRing I also had a moderate acne breakout (very unusual for me).
24	114	My breasts swelled, and became annoyingly sensitive, my face broke out with acne and I gained weight over two months time.
24	115	I did have some side effects (mild bloating, headaches, irregular period, acne) however, most have subsided or become tolerable.
24	116	The last time I was on it for about a week when my hands started breaking out in a weird rash and I felt odd.
24	117	I felt bloated all the time and I started breaking out.
24	118	CONS: I'm breaking out more than normal (the pill controlled my breakouts to like 1 a week if i was keeping up my skincare) and I've had about 5 white heads since starting and i don't normally get white heads so I'm not thrilled about that, also It drains my energy & i can't stay up more than 5-7 hours before NEEDING a nap, its so bad i can barely keep my eyes open even while driving at that point and when i do nap its VERY HARD to wake up fully and not feel groggy, hoping that stops.
24	119	Super nice because you don't have to remember a pill everyday, but after about a week I was borderline suicidal, moody and breaking out like crazy.
24	120	I was sold, until I noticed I have been consistently breaking out like a teenager, I am unusually dry and it is painful at first during sex because of this.
24	121	My face has been breaking out more than when I was in high school.
24	122	Two weeks into it however I have begun breaking out all over my body (I NEVER break out, EVER) and my forehead is littered with pimples.
24	123	I started breaking out on my face (which NEVER happened before) and I gained about 10-15 lbs (not that I was doing anything differently that would cause this).
24	124	I haven't had any of these problems with Nuvaring, the only thing I have against it is my skin seems to be a little more prone to breaking out when I'm on it.
24	125	Weight gain, too emotional, face breaking out like crazy.
24	126	But, It's given me pimples, made my boobs sore and destroyed my sex drive.
24	127	The first month of use brought me the worst deep pimples I have ever had, not just on my face, but also on my breast.
24	128	Aside from the pimples and dizziness, I was feeling better for longer.
24	129	I thought it was amazing until I started to get huge deep pimples.
24	130	I also have a few zits on my back that weren't there before I started NuvaRing...
24	131	Some other symptoms that I got with the Nuvaring were zits, hunger, and moody!
24	132	I used to get awful PMS, terrible cramps, and ovarian cysts that would land me in the hospital.
24	133	The only side effect I have are mild leg cramps that Motrin can take care of.
24	134	However, two months after using it I had MAJOR abdominal cramps to the point where I couldn't walk.
24	135	It felt like the worst period cramps ever & I'm no wimp...two healthy boys of my own.
24	136	My periods are heavy and my cramps are unbearable but my periods are shorter.
24	137	Regulates my period and I don't have severe menstrual cramps.
24	138	My doctor recommended it because I randomly began to have a very abnormal menstural cycle and the cramps became excruciating.
24	139	Ease of use is great, I have had no cramps, bloating, or break outs.
24	140	The first day I put the ring in, I had extremely bad cramps.
24	141	These cramps were followed by such severe abdominal pain I was not able to walk or drive for a period of time.
24	142	Terrible mood swings, cramps all month long, constantly  bloated, made my periods way worse, and there was an irritating discharge.
24	143	Nauseous, sweaty, extremely tired, lethargic, unhappy, starving then not hungry at all, cramps, itchiness, headaches, dehydrated, fuzzy head, cough, teary EXTREMELY teary, anxious, nervous, irritable.. you name it I had it!
24	144	Helped with cramps, but periods got confusing.
24	145	I got BAD headaches and the worst cramps I've ever had.
24	146	However, as the months of me using it piled up, so did my mood changes, killer cramps from hell, and increased anxiety.
24	147	PMS used to be mild to nonexistent, went to migraines from hell, debilitating cramps, etc.
24	148	I did have horrible cramps my first month using it when my period came but after a few months my body got used to it..
24	149	I did notice thatwhen I had no health insurance, I went about a month without it; I had gotten my period & it was horribly heavy & terrible cramps.
24	150	It lasted 2 months, filled with terrible cramps and very heavy bleeding.
24	151	I started getting bad leg cramps, migraines, shortness of breath, dizziness, bad abdominal pain, and some days couldn't get out of bed to take care of my 3 kids I was in so much pain.
24	152	I know others say it helps with cramps as well, but my pain hasn't decreased as far as I can remember.
24	153	I take it out on Monday and my period usually doesn't start until Thursday/Friday, with very mild period cramps for about a day and after that it's fine.
24	154	Only reason I gave it a 9/10 is because the day I put it in I get mild discomfort, almost like period cramps.
24	155	I used to have awful problems on various birth control pills such as Yas and Yazmin such as cramps and random spotting.
24	156	I've used NuvaRing for over two months now, and when I first started using it I had stomach pains (like cramps) for two days, but since then nothing.
24	157	BUT my period cramps are AWFUL!
24	158	I have also been on my period since the time I put it in which was two weeks ago, and the cramps have been extremely painful.
24	159	The only con I have is that after I take out the ring on the end of the 3rd week, my cramps from period seem to be more painful.
24	160	It actually made my periods lighter and I barely have cramps.
24	161	I do feel blowed everyday n I get pains in my stomach here and their like period cramps but nothing to intence.
24	162	I gained 15 pounds, was depressed, angry, had constant headaches, extreme fatigue and for the first time in my life i had cramps!
24	163	(I had never had cramps before!
24	164	I no longer have cramps and im no longer depressed!
24	165	Very few cramps when my period arrives which is exactly Wednesday to Friday every 4th week  (double awesome) plus my skin feels so soft and all of a sudden my hair grows wicked fast?
24	166	Also I barely have any cramps with nuvaring and have shorter period.
24	167	Bad depression, bad temper, bad cramps, sensitive breast, weight gain, tired and not in the mood for anything.
24	168	I started getting leg cramps which usually never happen and is supposed to be a sign of blood clots as stated in the side effects.
24	169	I love that I don't have to worry about a daily pill, light periods, normal moods vs pill, no cramps...almost everything I want!
24	170	My side effects are awful headaches and cramps here and there.
24	171	My whole reasoning to get on birth control was to help my miserable cramps, and periods.
24	172	I was so excited to have no cramps, and a short period.
24	173	Then, about a week later I started getting horrendous cramps, even worse than my period cramps.
24	174	The only downsides have been lots of breast tenderness which has FINALLY passed and bad cramps, randomly.
24	175	I've never had bad cramps so that part does suck.
24	176	I had cramps and terrible side effects all the time and just had it taken out last month because I have gained around 10lbs in my stomach area.
24	177	I get major mood swings, anxiety, depression, leg cramps and not interested in sex.
24	178	I did notice hair loss and I did start getting leg cramps during my time on this medication.
24	179	This month has been different (i.e., midmonth cramps, breast tenderness, lower back pain).
24	180	However, the convenience and the fact that my severe cramps and heavy flow greatly diminished, made it worth it to me.
24	181	It's helped regulate my periods and control my cramps.
24	182	When I started the Nuvaring I felt it inside my body and had a lot of cramps.
24	183	A few days later I started experiencing more cramps and very strong upper stomach pain.
24	184	I would be stuck at home for at least a day because my cramps were that awful.
24	185	After I started it my periods became normal, five days long, and significantly less cramps.
24	186	Headaches, and oh my gosh the back and and stomach cramps were almost as bad as when I had labor pains with my son.
24	187	After 3-4 months, I started getting intense cramps, bloating, and breast sensitivity for about a week before my period that lasted until I popped the next one back in.
24	188	After the NuvaRing no cramps at all and my period lasts about 3-4 days tops!
24	189	The only thing is that it did not help with my cramps and back pain, as the months go on, the pain gets worse and worse.
24	190	My periods are ridiculously light, 2 days long, and I have no cramps or PMS.
24	191	No side effects and actually my period cramps disappeared.
24	192	I started using the Nuvaring because I was having severe menstrual cramps and heavy periods.
24	193	At first, the side effects were acceptable- my chest broke out like crazy, it looked like a had a severe rash, but that was nothing, since my ridiculous cramps went away.
24	194	I have experienced some serious PMS symptoms since I've been on the ring (not every time but I think it's getting more frequent) like irritability and general emotionalness, some pretty severe cramps (which I rarely got before), and tiredness.
24	195	Recently, I had a super heavy flow during my period plus cramps.
24	196	There are no cramps and its very little but extremely annoying.
24	197	I've only experienced mild cramping since first using it (cramps while off my period), but nothing near unbearable.
24	198	Oh but it did help me with my severe cramps which my fiance loves!
24	199	I have also noticed a significant reduction in cramps and much lighter periods.
24	200	Nausea, headaches and occasional cramps were present.
24	201	Pros are many: 3 day period, few cramps, easy to use, can't feel during sex or anytime.
24	202	Nuvaring has regulated my cycle, practically diminished any menstrual cramps, and given me peace of mind, which is most important to me.
24	203	Granted, my experience with Yaz was not the best (breakthrough bleeding a lot), but upon using NuvaRing, my face broke out, I gained weight and I had constant cramps.
24	204	Plus I have nausea and painful cramps.
24	205	Other birth controls for me made me have awful mood swings, weight gain and awful cramps.
24	206	I am new to Nuvaring, just been using it for a month and have had a few side effects which are cramps, spotting, and the worst was a yeast infection, but I actually like it!
24	207	Unfortunately I have had more depressive periods and cramps have been horrible.
24	208	I was the girl who had horrible cycles, front and back cramps that could keep me out for the first day-sometimes two days-of my cycle.
24	209	I didn't have hardly any cramps and my mood swings lessened.
24	210	Of course I experience many side effects, such as headache, cramps, breast tenderness, bloating, breakthrough bleeding (first month only) and feeling pregnant all the time.
24	211	It can fall out during sex, and my cramps were awful.
24	212	2-3 months side effects started to kick in, more abdominal cramps, normal discharge, extreme bloating very often, nausea, and headaches.
24	213	I also used to have bad cramps but this helped a lot.
24	214	My periods are short, only about 2 1/2 days of light flow, but the cramps start 2 days before that and last right up til I put the next ring in.
24	215	The only problem I have had is when the Nuva Ring is out after the 3 weeks, I get VERY heavy menstrual flow and bad cramps.
24	216	Also, I've been having random cramps, or sharp pains in my abdomen.
24	217	My period has gone from 5 days to 3 days with a substantial decrease in cramp pain.
24	218	Now I have a regular period and my migraines are gone and I hardly ever cramp.
24	219	It also seemed to increase cramping which was something I never had problems with before but it wasn’t unbearable.
24	220	I've used it for 3 weeks and ended up with horrible headaches, extreme cramping in my stomach for a week now non stop, feeling delusional and very irritable with no sex drive what so ever when before taking this I've always had a very high sex drive.
24	221	So I was on the Nuva ring for 3-4 weeks and at first I experienced a lot of cramping and discomfort during sex.
24	222	I had severe cramping on my first day and Googled only to discover I wasn't alone.
24	223	I have only had it in for two days and have felt very nauseous, extremely tired, dizzy, angry, depressed, and have had a terrible headache and cramping.
24	224	I feel nothing now except for a moment of cramping.
24	225	My first few days on it were okay, I did not feel any of the symptoms besides a little bit of heavier cramping and more abdominal pain while on my period.
24	226	slight cramping but nothing out of the ordinary.
24	227	I experienced minimal cramping the first month and continued bloating during my periods.
24	228	I was sleepy, nausea like crazy, and cramping.
24	229	I had some fatigue day 1-2 also and some cramping and headache day 3. my sex drive has been insanely high.
24	230	The only symptom I have had is muscle cramping.
24	231	I didn't have cramping or anything but in the first 5 days I gained 5 lbs despite exercising 5 days per week.
24	232	I thought BC was supposed to help with cramping?
24	233	I experienced light cramping and my libido went down.
24	234	I was too weak and had too severe cramping to leave my bed for 12 hours.
24	235	Pros: No remembering pills, easy insertion/removal, never feel it/think about it, significantly less cramping with periods
24	236	Pros: Didn't get pregnant, regular periods, no cramping, no weight loss
24	237	No weight gain, super clear skin, no mood swings, light periods with no cramping and the convenience of not having to take a pill everyday.
24	238	I did have some side effects such as cramping and breakthrough bleeding, as well as the ring actually sliding out.
24	239	I was put on Microgestin FE 1/20 but stopped after the first month due to awful cramping in my arms/legs (which I still get during PMS) a year later I started NuvaRing and so far it has been no hassle at all.
24	240	My periods are light, 4 days long and I have little to no cramping when before I would be unable to move for hours due to menstrual cramps/ovulation and my flow was heavy for at least 5 days.
24	241	The cramping wouldn't go away, along with the cramping - my skin changed from silky soft to desert dry, and I was extremely itchy all over my body.
24	242	I do get the occasional stomach cramping.
24	243	My period was light, barely any cramping, & no spotting or ovary pains from my PCOS.
24	244	I normally have bad PMS and mood swings and bad cramping.
24	245	Breakthough bleeding.. cramping and bloating.. mood swings.
24	246	My first 6 months on NuvaRing were wonderful - my doc was using it to treat my symptoms of endometriosis (vomiting, intense cramping, etc).
24	247	The only side effects I have gotten are a little backache, little mood swings and slight cramping, but the plus side is I have shorter periods and lighter ones, overall best decision ever!
24	248	Little cramping but overall a great birth control method for me.
24	249	No increase in appetite, no cramping, no mood swings, and no pregnancies.
24	250	I have been on birth control for about 13 years and have used different types all have the same side effects; mood swings, bloating, cramping, weight gain, lack of sex drive and poor natural lubrication during sex.
24	251	Very mild cramping when it is period week, but the periods only last 2-3 days.
24	252	The constant cramping that came with it, along with the back pains and headaches just was not worth it.
24	253	No cramping or bloating or weight gain.
24	254	My stomach has been cramping some, but not anything compared to when I was on the pill.
24	255	I have little cramping and I know the EXACT dates I will flow.
24	256	I have had abdominal cramping and crazy mood swings, depression.
24	257	Now my periods only last about 2 days, no cramping, still no real weight gain.
24	258	Some cramping around my period that is mild and lasting longer than it used to when I was not on hormones.
24	259	I had clearer skin while I was on it and less cramping than I did before it.
24	260	The  side effects that I have experienced were mostly common- some water weight gain, shorter and lighter menstrual cycles, some cramping during my cycle.
24	261	Also, I have random abdomen cramping.
24	262	Makes my periods lighter/shorter/less crampy which is convenient, but I'm tired of the dryness/itching/discharge.
24	263	This isn't spotting.
24	264	No spotting or breast tenderness.
24	265	I bled almost constantly the entire time, and it was very heavy spotting, heavier than I had ever had from a period before using the ring.
24	266	I love not having to remember to take a pill every day, and although I get a bit of spotting before my period I do have a lighter flow and for only 4 days instead of 7.
24	267	After 3 weeks I started spotting.
24	268	I've been on it for 5 months now...during the 3rd month, I started bleeding (at first I thought it was spotting, but it lasts for like 2 weeks).
24	269	My periods have been very regular, no spotting, no mood swings, no change in sex drive.
24	270	I used to have a 7 day period and now it's 3 full days and 2 spotting days.
24	271	My sex drive has not decreased, no vaginal irritation but excessive lubrication, my period lasts 2-3 days, and no spotting while ring is inserted.
24	272	The first month I had about 10 days of spotting before my period.
24	273	I noticed I have a little spotting around the 3rd week of having it in.
24	274	I have had no weight gain, spotting, skin discolorations, nausea, or any other common side affect while I have been on this.
24	275	I had problems with mood swings and spotting with the pill so a friend said to try the ring and its eliminated those problems for me.
24	276	I had little to no spotting, and the initial three month break-in time frame was easy and I had no irregularities.
24	277	BAD bloating around the midsection (I am otherwise a slender woman and the bloat didn't look right on me), thinning hair, dark spotting of the skin on my back and stomach, borderline severe depression and anxiety.
24	278	After I inserted my next ring I have not stopped bleeding and its not just light spotting, its heavy bleeding most of the time.
24	279	I experienced spotting during the first month, but have not experienced any side effects since then.
24	280	On the regular pill, I was grateful to have eight or nine days without spotting; it was a miracle.
24	281	I don't feel it during sex, I feel completely normal, never experienced it slipping out, and no nasty spotting like the Depo shot.
24	282	My doctor gave me a trial ring and I was on it for one month, in which I was spotting or bleeding the entire month!!!
24	283	No real spotting either.
24	284	I first was on the pill, and I was spotting almost every day for months.
24	285	No periods or spotting.
24	286	However, I had spotting for around 20 days, which is something that's normal for me when I first go on birth control.
24	287	I haven't experienced weight gain, mood fluctuations, or spotting while on it.
24	288	Also I had breakthrough spotting the ENTIRE first month I was on the ring.
24	289	It made my period A LOT lighter (went from seven days with heavy bleeding to four days of just spotting), and the only downside I can find with it are the cost ($78).
24	290	With the ring leave it in 3 wks or 3wks n 2 days take it out for 4 days allow myself to spot to make sure I'm still good and put it back in.
24	291	I started with the ortho lo (the basic one in movies in the round case), Yaz came out and I switched to that, I was so tired of remembering to take a pill everyday, during my yearly pap my OBGYN told me about the patch I used it for a few years and I never gained weight on the pill or ring but for some reason the patch did make me gain some weight, I was always worried I put in the wrong spot and it wasn't going to work, taking it off weekly hurt like an extra strong bandaid and left purple gluey sticky stuff I had to scrub off with alcohol.
24	292	I used to spot on the pill mid-cycle pretty much every month.
24	293	I didn't know that I had an infection (my symptoms were one spot that was really itchy and fishy smelling discharge for about two-four days every month) and I left it untreated for months which caused it to be horrible (well, I don't know if the Nuvaring made it horrible or me leaving it untreated caused that).
24	294	I normally have to get my hair thinned at every haircut, now I have about a silver dollar sized bald spot - totally bald.
24	295	This is the second birth control I've used (had the pill Seasonale back in 2005, did nothing but spot all the time for six weeks), with the NuvaRing it is easy to insert, easy to remove and doesn't dislodge or fall out unless you might have some other issues.
24	296	I had severe headache and mood swings elevated high blood pressure..so much pain.
24	297	I've had a headache that has lasted over a week.
24	298	First couple days it worked out okay, I had a headache here or there and was pretty moody but other than that it was okay.
24	299	I am extremely tired, headache, and just feel off.
24	300	Then After 1.5 years I gained 10lbs, had tons of problems with my hair breaking, headaches off and on (never had a headache in my life), moody (unusual for me) chest pains, breast sore and plumper, As soon as I came off it within one week I dropped 5 lbs, now on my fourth week off and have lost 7.5 lbs.
24	301	I also started salivating a lot more (on the verge of drooling), had a much increased appetite, was nauseous, and on the day I decided to remove it, I was very dizzy for most of the day, nauseous, and had a headache.
24	302	I already suffer from migraine headaches and they stayed about the same but when I first take the ring out I automatically get a headache.
24	303	And when I first put it in I get a headache.
24	304	I had associated the headache and mood swings I experience with the Nuva Ring as run of the mill symptoms related to my cycle.
24	305	If the headache gets bad I simply use a pain killer and voila!
24	306	I had a pounding headache, I felt like I had not slept in three days, and I wanted to eat everything in sight.
24	307	Unfortunately, Nuvaring makes me SO tired that I gained weight due to inactivity since all I want to do is sleep, I suspect it has caused anxiety & depression (although I can't be sure), and it gives me a terrible headache & nausea the first 3 days I put a new ring in.
24	308	I got one migraine headache and was very bloated for the first couple weeks.
24	309	But so far I have had no side effects from Nuvaring minus the occasional very slight headache which I am already prone to and a little bit of extra discharge, which is also easily remedied.
24	310	I had a terrible headache and on going back pain which I thought was from my epidural but according to other reviews was from the Nuvaring.
24	311	When I first started it was working for me, but lately I'm finding that I'm getting serious headache ever so often and my eyes are now a bit blurry.
24	312	I enjoy the convenience of the ring but ever since I put the ring in about 4 days ago I have had a constant headache, extremely emotional, and very fatigued.
24	313	I have the same symptoms as follow (weight gain, so moody, I have never been so moody, increase vaginal discharge, constant headache, my fiance and I definitely feel the ring during intercourse).
24	314	I experienced some fatigue for a few days, a terrible headache for a few days and diarrhea this whole month.
24	315	I had nausea and headache.
24	316	Now I am at the 3rd week and I don%u2019t have nausea or headache.
24	317	I'm also tired constantly and have experienced pretty intense headaches and a lower sex drive.
24	318	I've also gotten some headaches and noticed some bloating around my abdomen.
24	319	Vaginal discomfort, headaches, ache, depression, fatigue, mild nausea, complete loss of sex drive, and a weird sense of feeling unbalanced, but not quite dizzy.
24	320	I have experienced some bloating and headaches easily but it's usually around a certain time of the month.
24	321	The only downside of it for me was I started getting headaches from it - easily cured with water and Advil!
24	322	I was put on Nuvaring after trying several different pills that didn't work for me (weight gain, irritability, headaches) and the Nuvaring has been amazing!
24	323	I have severe headaches, breast tenderness, and I'm tired all the time.
24	324	I soon begin to once in a while feel headaches and lots of tiredness.
24	325	I took those pills for a month but was advised by my gyn to switch bc because I started to get blurred vision and migraine headaches.
24	326	Only 2 drawbacks have been frequent headaches and daily discharge (inconvenient, but not a huge deal).
24	327	When I first started it, I had the typical headaches and nauseous feeling that's normal when starting BC.
24	328	I had this in for about two months, at which point I started experiencing horrible headaches.
24	329	Also I get 1-2 headaches a day since starting nuva.
24	330	No moodiness, no nausea, no headaches.
24	331	My headaches and moodiness lessened (now I just get a bit emotional around my period) and my sex drive has returned to normal.
24	332	CONS: takes a LONG TIME to adjust, slight weight gain, headaches, occasional moodiness.
24	333	I'm over it moving, slipping, falling out in my sleep, my gut aches, headaches and over all frustration and the cost was a waste of my money!
24	334	What scared me off of the ring is that every month a week before I start my period, I have gotten really dizzy, lightheaded and have been getting headaches.
24	335	Also the day after I put it in I started getting really bad headaches and I felt upset.
24	336	When I switched the side effects were fine, the only difference was I had headaches more often but it did help my weight problems.
24	337	I also get headaches here and there those have to be my only side affect with it.
24	338	My labito went down incredibly low to the point where the thought of even having sex would just give me headaches.
24	339	The two side effects that I've experienced are low libido and I get headaches a lot easier.
24	340	I was on the pill for 4 years and I had extreme anxiety and headaches.
24	341	A lot less headaches, no anxiety.
24	342	Since February 2015, I experienced shortness of breath, dry cough, headaches, pain and numbness in my legs and a sharp pain in my chest when I inhale.
24	343	Was getting headaches, couldn't sleep, had an anxiety attack out of nowhere and the brown discharge was gross plus it made my vag sore and itchy.
24	344	For the first month or two, I had terrible headaches at the end of the days I had class, but everything else was fine.
24	345	Although I did not experience these headaches at all or these levels of mood swings before starting the NuvaRing, I explained them to myself as the normal adult symptoms I’d developed with getting older as I didn’t want to cry wolf or say the sky was falling when it wasn’t.
24	346	I had a few side effects: weight gain(with no change in diet), headaches, NO sex drive, and periods that started a week early.
24	347	Initially on it to control my headaches, now to prevent a baby.
24	348	Gained 30 pounds, headaches & absolutely no sex drive.
24	349	Bad back ache, abdominal tenderness, diarrhea, break outs along my jaw, upper back and hairline, vaginal irritation, headaches, occasional low grade fever, abdominal pain after sex, lack of energy, lack of concentration and I'm extremely cranky.
24	350	I did not have any issues with headaches, feeling nauseous or differences in my appetite.
24	351	I got very naseous and had bad headaches.
24	352	Of course there were still hormones in my system but the nausea and the severe headaches went away almost instantly.
24	353	With Nuvaring 3 months in, I have had mood swings headaches, weight gain 142lbs to 157lbs.
24	354	I have also gained about 10-15 pounds, which is not normal for me at all (20 years old), low to really no sex drive, headaches, nausea.
24	355	I experienced some side effects (headaches & nausea) but didn't think to attribute them to the Nuvaring.
24	356	Then they became regular, and the headaches got bad!
24	357	Anyhow I'm going to 4 years of using the NuvaRing and I've started to get many side effects, from many headaches to low sex drive and a lot of Breast tenderness.
24	358	I use the ring for 4 weeks, then take it out for 4 days to minimize any headaches.
24	359	At first, my headaches got worse -- I was having them when the ring was in and when it was out.
24	360	However, after about 3 months of erratic headaches, things seem to be settling down.
24	361	I am prone to anxiety and headaches but all that has been just business as usual for me, no increase.
24	362	The headaches are bad when I do get them and the back pain is a killer but nothing a little Motrin can't handle.
24	363	All I know is that since I've been on it I've had massive headaches weeks at a time and nausea constantly and I wanted to trigger that at my gluten sensitivity and maybe eating something wrong.
24	364	Pro: No headaches or nausea.
24	365	I used to be on the pill and it was a huge hassle for me (I always forgot to take it) and I had a long list of negative side effects (weight gain, upset stomach and headaches).
24	366	I've been getting some headaches and back pain too but I'm not sure it's because of the ring.
24	367	I took the NuvaRing out and now I've had unbearable headaches.
24	368	Zero sex drive, horrible headaches, 24/7 nausea, ache, and diarrhea.
24	369	The only small thing I'm not really comfortable with is the vaginal secretion and sometimes I get headaches right before I'm supposed to remove it.
24	370	But I also experienced serious mood swings, headaches and depression, and the heavy discharge.
24	371	Kariva gave me terrible headaches that put me in the emergency room.
24	372	I had headaches, felt unmotivated, and indifferent about life.
24	373	I have constant headaches.
24	374	Started Nuvaring on a Sunday and by Tuesdsay I was in the emergency room with  severe abdominal pain, back pain, and headaches.
24	375	One week later, put a new ring in, and then started having serious pee issues- pain and burning, moodiness like all get-out, headaches.
24	376	I'm not thank goodness, but these side effects have been getting worse.I have been getting headaches and I am moody brat lately.
24	377	On Nuvaring still have mood swings, more headaches now, at times feel very tired, still have bad breakouts and also an almost non existent sex drive.
24	378	I had a migraine once, too.
24	379	However, recently I have been having one horrible migraine every month the day before my period (the day I take nuvaring out).
24	380	My migraine specialist suggested that I try it and have triptans as a backup.
24	381	Eventually I'm planning to leave it in for 4 weeks but in the mean time I only had 1 migraine and could tell it was going to be bad so I took a triptan.
24	382	Took it out, got migraines, hot flashes anxiety and irregular periods.
24	383	I get hot flashes and migraines every day.
24	384	I've never had migraines before.
24	385	I have the worst stomach pain and migraines!!!!!
24	386	My migraines are much less frequent.
24	387	At first I had some pretty terrible mood swings and migraines.
24	388	Alot of my pain and migraines have decreased since being off it just 5 days.
24	389	This birth control was a life saver I originally went on this because I had severe migraines due to hormones and this by far was the best choice for me because there is no hormonel spikes also I only get my period four times a year.
24	390	I still get migraines once in a blue moon but they're not nearly as severe as they once were.
24	391	I highly recommend this product to anyone who has an unpredictable schedule and might forget to take a pill and anyone who might be plagued with severe migraines due to hormones.
24	392	At the same time I started experiencing what were likely aura migraines.
24	393	I was bleeding so bad, I had horrible migraines, blood clots coming out and vomiting.
24	394	I had to stop using because the last 6 months I started experiencing severe migraines.
24	395	My ob/gyn switched me from the patch to Nuvaring because I was getting estrogen-withdrawal migraines when I took the patch off.
24	396	I went on the Nuvaring because I get excruciating menstrual migraines.
24	397	They were different symptoms than migraines.
24	398	I haven't had any noticeable mood issues or migraines.
24	399	I have migraines and this hasn't aggravated them like the Ortho Tri-Cyclen did.
24	400	Gone through migraines, excessive bleeding patterns, no sex drive at all,  mood swings, as most recently while on Loestrin 24 I spent 14 months basically crying every day until I finally switched to Nuvaring.
24	401	I got migraines and extreme nausea.
24	402	Now my skin is even, and I no longer get migraines.
24	403	But haven't had anymore migraines since going on which is why I have to take birth control (regulates my hormones) but I'm seriously considering going off just because of the 2 side effects I am having.
24	404	I get very moody, severe migraines and of course, my sex drive was non-existent.
24	405	Also, I have migraines regularly and didn't want to try a IUD or anything inserted in my arm.
24	406	Mad at my husband for no reason and no sex drive.
24	407	No sex drive anymore and I can feel things with my boyfriend changing due to my irritability, anxiety, and no sex drive.
24	408	It does decrease your sex drive but I don’t really care
24	409	My biggest change was a COMPLETE loss in my sex drive.
24	410	I did experience vaginal dryness and extreme decrease in my sex drive, which really made sex unpleasurable at times.
24	411	Worst of all  I lost my sex drive.
24	412	In this time I lost my virginity and it was extremely painful and I had no sex drive.
24	413	I figured the pain was just from the first time but the pain continued every time I had intercourse and I rarely even wanted to have sex; because it hurt and I had no sex drive.
24	414	I thought there was something wrong with my body and the low sex drive was a symptom of depression.
24	415	my sex drive seems fine, it might have gone away for a few weeks but that could have also been due to stress.
24	416	About 2 years in, my sex drive was non-existent.
24	417	I had no sex drive and I ended up getting a yeast infection the last week having it in.
24	418	However, it may completely eliminate your sex drive.
24	419	I've enjoyed this product BUT I can say it has changed my mood and I have no sex drive.
24	420	The only con I had was I lost sex drive for about 5 months.
24	421	I have an increased sex drive too.
24	422	Only 2 weeks in and already have a yeast infection, major  anxiety, feeling depressed and a loss of sex drive....
24	423	Mood swings, depression, low sex drive, etc.
24	424	Month two has been better as far as nausea, but I have NO SEX DRIVE.
24	425	A couple things I've noticed is that my breasts are extremely tender and my sex drive is unfortunately VERY low.
24	426	I've been on it for 2 years and there's been no changes in my sex drive.
24	427	My sex drive is down.
24	428	PROS: can't forget to take it, has made me even more lubricated down there (hasn't affected sex drive negatively at all)
24	429	I've experienced no weight gain, no mood swings, and maintain a healthy sex drive.
24	430	My sex drive hasn't suffered much either!
24	431	It has decreased my sex drive tremendously but I also don't want to have another baby yet, so not having sex with my husband like we used to isn't a big deal for either of us.
24	432	It also killed my sex drive, but I kind of expected that.
24	433	But for me it causes about a 10lb weightgain and kills my sex drive.
24	434	I was hoping it would increase my sex drive but it's the same.
24	435	I love my nuvaring besides the fact that it has killed my sex drive.
24	436	I have no sex drive.
24	437	I also have a decrease in sex drive, vaginal dryness, and discomfort when having intercourse.
24	438	I would agree with many other reviewers- zero sex drive.
24	439	I don't really have a sex drive but it doesn't bother me.
24	440	I have had no problems except I literally have no sex drive anymore.
24	441	My sex drive has always been above average and since being on this birth control, I have had zero desire to have sex and when I do, it takes quite a bit of foreplay to get me only barely wet.
24	442	However, I had great skin, short periods (3 days, my back would kill for the first day) and never got a decreased sex drive.
24	443	I have such a decreased sex drive and it is so affected and sometimes puts a strain on my relationship, (I have been with him for 3 years so he's been thru the BC changes and has noticed himself)..and the ring has probably made my aniexty worse, I did not have anxiety problems until using the ring, they are mild episodes but still annoying to have.
24	444	No weight gain yet, my skin is staying clear, increased sex drive a lot, I feel a bit sad but I've felt like this since the birth of my son 6w ago.
24	445	Over the past year I did experience decreased sex drive, fatigue, increase in anxiety and weight gain.
24	446	I used to get horrible side effects from the pill but the only negative side effect from the Nuva ring is that about 2 weeks out of the month I don't have really any sex drive but I'll take that over acting like a lunatic and not even getting to have sex cause I scared my partner off haha.
24	447	My sex drive was noticeably diminished to the point where I didn't even want to have sex sometimes (and that NEVER happens lol).
24	448	My sex drive has stayed the same over all these years.
24	449	No sex drive either, as in I could never have sex again while on this drug and I'd be fine.
24	450	My sex drive had decreased nausea every morning.
24	451	It hasn't decreased my sex drive...
24	452	Also my sex drive is so low I couldn't care less if I ever have sex again which is NOT normal for me.
24	453	Cleared my face up and it didn't affect my sex drive.
24	454	Long story short my sex drive was non existent.
24	455	On NuvaRing, my sex drive has somewhat returned (of course not as much as if I wasn't in birth control), it's easier for me to "get there", and I don't have PMS nearly as bad.
24	456	I read the side effects and was scared to be moody or have a low sex drive.
24	457	I have absolutely no sex drive.
24	458	I lost my sex drive almost completely and seven months later I am still struggling to get my sex drive back.
24	459	Things have changed since, my sex drive is low, I'm an emotional trainwreck for no reason.
24	460	My sex drive might be down a little bit but nothing major.
24	461	Over the last two years I've had a dramatic increase in side effects, zero, and I mean ZERO sex drive.
24	462	I had zero weight gain and I my sex drive was normal.
24	463	I have gained 15 pounds, lost my sex drive, and have been extremely Moody and unable to feel like myself.
24	464	Reading through different threads I now have come to believe that the NuvaRing has diminished my sex drive.
24	465	My sex drive is gone....and my face is broken out to the point where I get new blemishes daily.
24	466	It does not come out during sex, no dryness down there, high sex drive!!!
24	467	My doctor recommended the Nuvaring to me after I told her how I didnt like taking birth control pills because I forget and also I had no sex drive while on the pill.
24	468	It has taken a toll on our marriage due to my low sex drive not sure if it's related to the product but after reading a few reviews I'm guessing it is.
24	469	My sex drive I believe has increased a tiny bit... already was high but I haven't had sex yet since I have had it in due to my partners work schedule.
24	470	Also I have had some weight gain, and loss of sex drive - but both are minor.
24	471	I haven't gained any weight that I've noticed, my sex drive is still very high.
24	472	No weight gain (loss 10lb), no depression, increase sex drive.
24	473	My sex drive has decreased tremendously!
24	474	Sex drive may be decreased but that suits my husband better anyway.
24	475	Fast forward to 3-5 months, I was moody, I was even a little depressed, and I had no sex drive.
24	476	Also my sex drive decreased 100%!!
24	477	Kills my sex drive.
24	478	But the only down side is that I have absolutely no sex drive whatsoever.
24	479	I hate that the ring wants to slip out half the time, painful for me and partner during sex, & decreased sex drive.
24	480	My sex drive has actually increased, not likely from the ring itself, but from the peace of mind knowing I didn't forget a dose.
24	481	I am skeptical if I've gained weight from it though and my sex drive did decrease.
24	482	The only thing I don't like it absolutely no sex drive.
24	483	I have had no negative side effects except for lowered sex drive and moderate dryness during intercourse.
24	484	NuvaRing caused for me to have no sex drive whatsoever.
24	485	And my sex drive went way down on the ring.
24	486	The down sides are decreased sex drive for one week of my cycle after my period, and for the first 6 month I experienced dryness but that went away.
24	487	I gained around 7 pounds, wanted to sleep all the time and lost completely my sex drive.
24	488	However, I can't help but notice that I've gained weight especially around my waistline which almost never happens, and my sex drive has decreased.
24	489	It dulls my sex drive a bit, but nothing major.
24	490	Another thing is about 6 months into it I felt like I had no sex drive.
24	491	A lot of women said their sex drive went down but I feel like mine went up.
24	492	Dr switched me to Loestrin, however I lost my sex drive completely.
24	493	My sex drive is back, my yeast infections are gone, the little blackheads I had are almost all gone as well.
24	494	Every other I have tried (Mircette, Beyaz, Ortho Tri-cyclen and one other I can't recall) have all caused weight gain, anxiety/agitation, nausea, extremely decreased sex drive and various other symptoms.
24	495	I've hardly had sex since I've been on it because I have no sex drive.
24	496	No mood swings, no lack of sex drive.
24	497	Sex drive not effected like others have said in their reviews.
24	498	I have been very moody lately and will cry for basically no reason and my sex drive is definitely lower.
24	499	It doesn't decrease my sex drive, and although I am newly married, I have to admit my sexual desire has increased.
24	500	Have been using it for about 2 years, no problems light period, no weight gain but I didn't realize my lack of sex drive until I got off of it.
24	501	However my sex drive has declined.
24	502	However, after the first month or so, my sex drive was completely gone.
24	503	There are a couple down sides to it though, no sex drive and tendency to gain weight.
24	504	However the decrease in sex drive is quite irritating for both my husband and myself.
24	505	I have had tender breasts and to top that off low sex drive and supposed breakthrough bleeding for two months straight.
24	506	After being on it for only 3 months, I noticed an extreme weight gain, loss of sex drive, virtually no vaginal fluid, breast tenderness, anxiety, and severe mood swings.
24	507	But as time went on, after the first year or so, I began to notice my sex drive wasn't as strong.
24	508	Two years in, I had zero sex drive whatsoever, and three years in I experienced many more side effects.
24	509	I have since gained almost 15 lbs and have no sex drive, which is putting a major strain on my relationship.
24	510	Cons would have to be the decrease in sex drive but a little exercise helps with that.
24	511	My sex drive is still the same.
24	512	Other than that, I love that I don't have to remember to take it everyday and my sex drive hasn't changed a bit.
24	513	I was prepared for some side effects but so far there's only more wetness (not bothersome) and a reduction in sex drive (haven't decided if it's bothersome or not yet).
24	514	I've been on the ring for about 2 years and I LOVE the ease of it but don't like the decrease in sex drive (its non existent) and the increase in breast size.
24	515	Also my sex drive has increased and both me and my husband don't feel it!
24	516	I love the Ring, but I did get side effects like sore breasts and low sex drive, which I think goes with any hormone birth control.
24	517	The pills were also lowering my sex drive, but with the Nuvaring all my problems are gone!
24	518	After about 6 months, I started losing my sex drive and when I did have sex, it would be painful.
24	519	After being on Ortho TriCyclen Lo for 10 months, I found that I had zero sex drive.
24	520	After only using Nuvaring for a week, I see a HUGE difference in my sex drive.
24	521	I thought maybe I just needed more time to adjust to it and now, a year and a half later, I have absolutely no sex drive, am exhausted, and cry/am anxious for no reason.
24	522	My sex drive has begun to come back- something I thought I no longer even had, and I feel like a normal person again.
24	523	It has not given me any mood swings, it has BOOSTED my sex drive!
24	524	I haven't really noticed any change in my sex drive.
24	525	I actually have a sex drive for the first time in 3 months.
24	526	The downsides I've experienced are: mild discomfort, vaginal irritation and low sex drive.
24	527	I hated take the pill and Yaz and Tri-Sprintec made me so depressed, moody and I had no sex drive.
24	528	My sex drive is getting better so wish me luck.
24	529	Cons- my boyfriend and I feel it during sex so we take it out, it gets me very moody and emotional, if my sex drive was at 100%; it's now at 40%.
24	530	I have been on the ring for 2 years, but I am now realizing that my mood swings, hair loss and zero sex drive is from this birth control.
24	531	The only thing is my sex drive has dropped dramatically.
24	532	What makes my score not a 10 is the fact that it has dramatically killed my sex drive.
24	533	The first time around I loved not having to remember to take a pill everyday and I had no mood swings, and no lack of sex drive, there was only a few times where I could actually feel it during intercourse that was a bit uncomfortable.
24	534	Those being; loss of sex drive, emotional roller coaster, weight gain, breast tenderness, no energy, and (ethical reason) it's horrible for the environment.
24	535	I lost all of my sex drive, along with natural vaginal lubrication (I now have to resort to lube every time).
24	536	As time continued however, my sex drive took a dive, I got tired all the time, and I find that whenever I'm on the ring, I get nasty discharge that goes away when I go off for a month or two.
24	537	The Nuvaring cleared my skin, gave me (welcome) curves, and increased my sex drive.
24	538	and had to buy ALL new clothes), lose ALL sex drive, and drained me of all energy.
24	539	I'm always miserable and depressed and my sex drive is gone.
24	540	I recently noticed that I couldn't accurately place it in me, or it would slide out all the time, and I had zero sex drive.
24	541	The first month I had it in my sex drive was a bit low, and I felt tired.
24	542	I've tried Yaz.. gave me chest pains and loss of sex drive.
24	543	But it killed my sex drive from the second month using it (unless the ring comes out for a few days) and I have had a few yeast infections and almost constant discharge.
24	544	Now that I'm off birth control I feel a lot less bloated and I have my sex drive back!
24	545	No weight gain, skin good, sex drive the same.
24	546	The first birth control I ever used that is no hassle, no major side effects, well some minor is the vaginal infection (but plain yogurt with active culture will do the job and take care of it) and yes it does decrease your sex drive.
24	547	No feelings of depression, no skin-breakouts, no change in sex drive and no dryness.
24	548	You can also forget about your sex drive!
24	549	My only complaint is the extremely low sex drive.
24	550	My sex drive has completely disappeared which was not a normal thing for me.
24	551	Since I've been on it I have noticed my zero sex drive and constant break outs.
24	552	I'll be getting off this and going back to condoms if I don't get a sex drive soon.
24	553	I dropped 5 lbs instantly, had a huge sex drive, more lubrication, and just felt better.
24	554	After 3 months I had enough of the itching and not that great of a sex drive.
24	555	Oh, and no sex drive at all.
24	556	However, I've noticed that my sex drive has diminished greatly over the past year or so.
24	557	I've lost over 15 pounds and am very happy with my sex drive.
24	558	I see all these comments saying that the sex drive drops, lubrication is down.....not in my case.
24	559	But this second month I have had a small yeast infection and been pretty dry down there and my sex drive is not what it was but not gone.
24	560	I do hope it does not kill my sex drive.
24	561	I have about zero to no sex drive and experience dryness during sex.
24	562	It doesn't make sense to me to use a birth control that kills you sex drive and therefore the reason you are on it, so I'm switching to the IUD in the next couple of weeks.
24	563	The biggest draw back for me is my diminished sex drive.
24	564	Other than the decreased sex drive, I haven’t experienced any other side effects like weight gain or moodiness.
24	565	I have an increased sex drive and have had no slipping and it has never fallen out.
24	566	Side effects have been very mild, such as slight decrease in vaginal lubrication, occasional vaginal irritation, and slight decrease in sex drive.
24	567	It was overall a positive experience, but it costs so much and I'm hoping the lower hormone doses in an IUD will boost my sex drive a bit.
24	568	The ONLY downside was that I had absolutely no sex drive.
24	569	If it weren't for the 100% change in sex drive (and the fact there's no generic yet), I'd go back on Nuvaring in a heartbeat.
24	570	My sex drive decreased to nothing.
24	571	It is very convenient not having to remember taking a pill everyday, but my sex drive went from very, very high (before the ring), to nothing.
24	572	I absolutely cannot live without my sex drive.
24	573	My major side effect is no sex drive!
24	574	I had no loss of sex drive, no hair loss and never fell out during sex.
24	575	It has decreased my sex drive, but that's okay for me.
24	576	Within a month I noticed a decrease in my sex drive, and I've had vaginal dryness which makes sex painful.
24	577	I never really noticed but I had no sex drive.
24	578	I love the NuvaRing and it has no side effects on my sex drive or any other part of my life.
24	579	Just so everyone on here knows, it is not just Nuvaring that kills your sex drive, all hormonal contraceptives do it.
24	580	My sex drive did not decrease on NuvaRing.
24	581	Con's: No sex drive, dryness, crazy mood swings.
24	582	My sex drive has been reduced to nothing, except late in my period, not coincidentally when the ring has been out the longest.
24	583	I hate to give up a birth control that's so easy to use, but I refuse to spend my life without any sex drive.
24	584	But one the the side effects I have that I don't like is no sex drive.
24	585	My sex drive went way down along with lubrication.
24	586	I had a pretty high libido before Nuva ring.
24	587	Only real symptoms have been a decrease libido and weight loss (I've been eating the same amounts/foods and haven't increased exercise but have lost 2-3 pounds)
24	588	I have been on Nuva ring for quite a few years I though it was great and loved that I didn't have to think about taking a pill but as the years have went by I'm noticing I'm not myself still getting chest pain and leg pain tired all the time no patience, no libido very emotional not sure what to do.
24	589	When I first started this I felt anxious a lot and always moody, definitely didn't have any libido what so ever.
24	590	Complete loss of libido hit me about month 7, and that's when I decided to quit.
24	591	No libido.
24	592	I was very depressed , anxious and I cried all the time..not to mention the lack of libido sucks.
24	593	I did have mood swings right before my period and possible drop in libido, but I'm not sure if it was from the NR or due to stress.
24	594	The depression and decreased libido were the main things I couldn't stand, so I got off it after six months.
24	595	I experienced a dramatic drop in libido and this was ultimately the main reason for me to stop but there were other side effects as nausea, some weight gain and it really irritated my urinary tract in the beginning too.
24	596	That being said, NR has given me extreme mood swings and depression and also very low libido.
24	597	Maybe the worst part is that I have a very low libido.
24	598	Long story short, I ran out of refills and went a few weeks without and realized the nuva was surpressing my libido.
24	599	I did love how easy it was and didn't have to think about it everyday, but I did experience vaginal dryness and a decreased libido (which I mean, is good when you don't want to be pregnant, and don't even want to have sex to begin with).
24	600	The only thing I've noticed is that my libido has decreased significantly!
24	601	I was formerly in LoLoestrinFe and had horrible horrible mood swings and a complete disappearance of libido.
24	602	I also have no libido to speak of when before it was healthy.
24	603	It has however caused my libido to go down.
24	604	Once my body adjusted, (which took about a month of use) it made my periods lighter, increased my cup size, and my libido!
24	605	I'm very moody with this birth control and my libido is ALL THE WAY DOWN.
24	606	It killed my libido.
24	607	Overall I stopped after 6 months because my lack of libido was frustrating for me and him.
24	608	I was depressed, sex hurt, and my libido was gone.
24	609	And, the best part, my libido is back!
24	610	Diminished libido also.
24	611	My libido is very low but I'm not sure if that's me or the ring.
24	612	I had no issues with libido prior to taking the pill, so I was devastated to find my new sex life lacking.
24	613	But, after two months of no libido, and no lubrication, I am done with it.
24	614	I also have not had any issues with depression but I have noticed my libido is a bit less since I have been on it.
24	615	In the past, I've not been able to take hormonal birth control because it zaps my libido and makes orgasm difficult to achieve.
24	616	With NuvaRing, since the dosage of hormones is small, I have had no decrease in libido (yeah!)
24	617	My libido was very low, putting quite a strain on my relationship with my boyfriend.
24	618	I started using Nuvaring 3 months ago, I've experienced breakthrough bleeding, mood swings and depression, decreased libido and dryness.
24	619	Unfortunately, NuvaRing has killed my libido, which started shortly after I began using it and has only gotten worse.
24	620	I never had weight gain or mood changes.
24	621	I've had no side effects or weight gain (a part from the natural small weight gain with age).
24	622	I did not experience any side effects or weight gain, and my periods were light and short (only 3 days by the end).
24	623	I haven't had any weight gain.
24	624	Now, I'm at 12 months in (definitely not pregnant by the way) and I finally am noticing an overall weight gain in addition to my belly bloat.
24	625	I didn't experience any mood swings or weight gain.
24	626	Weight gain.
24	627	I have never had issues with mood swings, weight gain etc.
24	628	Within the three weeks I started to notice how much I was sleeping, mood changes, weight gain, and feeling completely horrible about myself.
24	629	I've never had any true issues with any weight gain on BC, but I am very prone to yeast infections.
24	630	I knew weight gain was possible but this has been the worst side effect for me.
24	631	No weight gain, and I have clear skin!
24	632	I have experienced around 25 pounds of weight gain.
24	633	I was only around 110lbs when I started this birth control so the weight gain looks healthy.
24	634	No problems with the Nuvaring aside from slight weight gain (couple of pounds), which I can live with.
24	635	So I had tried the pill in college which left me 30lbs heavier, fast forward 4 years and I find myself trying to pick out a birth control that wouldn't cause such a dramatic weight gain.
24	636	No weight gain, no mood disturbances, no pain, etc.
24	637	I took the Nuvaring out about 2 months ago and I have noticed a difference in my attitude and the weight gain stopped.
24	638	I was on the pill before and I definitely felt the side effects...I was hungry all the time, breakouts, moodiness and depression...and weight gain.
24	639	I never noticed any weight gain or mood changes.
24	640	However I will say I've had minor weight gain, and some minor hair loss.
24	641	Tender breasts, weight gain, mood swings where I don't even recognize myself.
24	642	I have weight gain.
24	643	I did not experiance any mood swings or weight gain and I loved that fact that I always was in complete control of it there was never any guessing if it fell out or moved like the IUD's.
24	644	It's easy, periods have been light and no weight gain or issues with mood.
24	645	No weight gain, easier periods, less bloating.
24	646	no weight gain, actually I have lost about 2 pounds, not sure if there is any relation there.
24	647	I switched to Nuvaring because my weight gain with the pill was excessive.
24	648	General Pros:Easy to use and low maintenance, No weight gain (butnever had issues w this), Doesn't affect my moods.
24	649	Let's start with the positives though - regular periods that are very light, almost perfect skin except when on the period, no hair loss, no mood changes, and no weight gain.
24	650	But over time, I noticed my face start to break out a little more, had weight gain and my vagina was always dry which led to problems within our sex life.
24	651	Crazy anxiety a few days before period, weight gain (15 pounds in 3 months), constantly bloated.
24	652	If it wasn't for the significant weight gain, I would have stayed on it.
24	653	PROS: No weight gain (I actually dropped the weight I gained from the pill soon after I started), very clear skin, even moods with no major mood swings, don't feel or notice it, no daily remembering required, periods significantly lighter, shorter, and with less discomfort, effective immediately at regulating my cycle and has continued that way throughout use, it even has enough hormones in a ring to leave it in and skip your period if you prefer.
24	654	No weight gain.
24	655	Otherwise, I experienced no weight gain or hormonal issues.
24	656	I don't see any weight gain but I believe it's too early to know.
24	657	However, I have experienced weight gain which I thought was what I was eating and drinking but looking back, the weight gain started right when I switch back from the pill to the NuvaRing.
24	658	I haven't noticed weight gain or loss.
24	659	I have tried Loestrin Fe 24 & Ortho Tri Cyclen, both to no avail.. mood swings, depression, weight gain *permanently* of 10 pounds each time.
24	660	With every birth control there are bouts of Sadness and anxiousness, but you distract yourself by watching great movies and eating popcorn, not tons of goodies which probably increases weight gain.
24	661	I have never attributed weight gain the the Nuva Ring, but my own diet.
24	662	I experienced no weight gain (people blame their birth control for that way too often), my skin was fine, no mood swings, no side effects whatsoever.
24	663	I've had no weight gain and my hormones are the same as they've always been.
24	664	I am able to deal with the weight gain and adjust my lifestyle to where it is not a problem.
24	665	It's a fantastic form of birth control; You only have to remember to take it out every 3 weeks, no mood swings, no weight gain (I actually lost 20 pounds while using the ring from switching to a healthy lifestyle), and my boyfriend doesn't feel it during sex.
24	666	I had no side effects, no weight gain, my periods where regular, except that my partner was able to feel it which was no problem.
24	667	I switched from pills which caused major weight gain and significant side effects after prolonged use.
24	668	Had a little weight gain at the beginning but that can happen with all birth controls.
24	669	I've been on at least six different pills with different hormone levels, and other than weight gain and depression, the pill had no effect on me.
24	670	I had no weight gain or mood swings, and never even notice it in there.
24	671	I didnt experience any weight gain it was quite the opposite I have noticed that I am losing weight but in a healthy amount.
24	672	No mood swings, no weight gain, shorter period, and barely any PMS.
24	673	I have fatigue, 8-10 weight gain, widening of my hips, and about a 2 cup breast size increase.
24	674	What's worse is that a lot of the weight gain in around my abdomen so none of my clothes fit.
24	675	Since I went on Nuvaring I have not experienced weight gain and I have not felt any abnormal mood swings.
24	676	No major side effects- I think my small weight gain was due to college more than Nuvaring.
24	677	I haven't had any weight gain, except for my breasts got two sizes bigger.
24	678	No weight gain, fuller breasts, no crazy mood swings.
24	679	I have been eating a little more, but no weight gain except my breasts and no complaints there.
24	680	But I've had no weight gain, no nothing after the first week!
24	681	Just a little weight gain (5-10 lbs) but larger breasts.
24	682	I don't have mood swings and no weight gain.
24	683	I loved how easy it was, I didn't experience any pain or weight gain and my complexion improved greatly!
24	684	I haven't had any problems with the medication; no weight gain, no mood swings.
24	685	Very sad about it though, this birth control is perfect besides the weight gain.
24	686	I mean with all the mood swings, weight gain, it was overwhelming.
24	687	I have had no weight gain, back pain.
24	688	No weight gain for me.
24	689	Side effects,  weight gain, mood swings, irregular periods etc.
24	690	I have had no noticeable weight gain, or mood swings and my period is on almost the same day every month and they have become very short and light lasting only 1 to 2 days.
24	691	I didn't experience any weight gain and it gave me a regular period, my partner and I never experienced any discomfort from it, and it was definitely an improvement from the "crazy moodiness" I had on the Depo shot.
24	692	I have had no mood swings, weight gain nor depression.
24	693	The Nuvaring personally helped me because I was on the depo shot for about 7 months and I gained so much weight and constantly wanted to eat.
24	694	Let me start by saying I have gained about 15 lbs in 3 months and my breasts have grown 2 cup sizes.
24	695	I gained 20 lbs and could not lose it with dieting and working out.
24	696	My boobs have grown a size and I have gained approximately 10 pounds.
24	697	I also gained a lot of weight coming off, 13 lbs in 2 weeks.
24	698	Also I gained so much weight, and I exercise and ate pretty decent where I shouldn't gain 30lbs all together.
24	699	When it was about a year into the ring I gained about 15lbs then I stopped it for 2 months lost a few pounds easy and then put myself back on it and gained 30lbs.
24	700	The biggest issue for me is that I've probably gained 40 lbs since I started and I've been the same weight for years.
24	701	I have not gained any weight and it has not affected intercourse but it may cost me my relationship.
24	702	It's very easy to use, my skin is clear, my periods are much more tolerable, I have gained about 15-20 pounds within the last year, but I was only 105 lbs, so I look healthier and my breasts are a lot larger.
24	703	I've been on this medication for about 2 months and I've already gained 15 pounds.
24	704	BUT I feel like I have a UTI all the time, my skin has gotten worse and I've gained 10 lbs even while eating healthy and cutting out processed foods and dairy (I'm 5'1, so 10 lbs feels like 20 lbs).
24	705	I gained 4 pounds the first week and I'm VEGAN!
24	706	More recently I have noticed being dry for no reason even when I'm extremely turned on, and I have gained 15 pounds since I've had it with no change in my diet or excercise.
24	707	I've gained about 1 cup size also.
24	708	I have also gained a few pounds since being on this birth control, but I can deal with that.
24	709	On the flip side- never gained weight, was super easy to insert and forget about, maintained periods, didn't feel like it caused moodiness or was mentally hazardous.
24	710	I have been on the ring for a few months I have had an increase in appetite, times where I feel nauseated out of no where, I have gained 12 lbs!!
24	711	I was even training for a half marathon and still gained weight.
24	712	In one year I gained about 12-15 lbs.
24	713	With the Nuva ring my weight has been stable (I did start a workout/diet plan so this may be the reason why I haven't gained any weight.
24	714	I've tried the IUD but I gained weight to much to quick.
24	715	I have also gained some weight.
24	716	But after about a year I noticed I gained about ten lbs.
24	717	I gained a lot of weight being on the Patch but when I was on the Ring, I was able to lose the weight and stay the same weight.
24	718	I have times when I get depressed, I had mood swings, felt like throwing up and even when I didn't even eat I gained about 15lbs.
24	719	From the second month to the sixth month, I gained about twenty pounds with no significant lifestyle changes or dietary changes besides the NuvaRing.
24	720	I also have not gained any unwanted weight from using this contraceptive, which is a huge thing for me.
24	721	The weight was extremely hard to lose while I was on the ring, but after I switched to another contraceptive the weight I had gained melted off.
24	722	I haven't gained any weight and I've been on it for two years but the side effects just aren't worth it.
24	723	At this stage I just saw my OB/Gyn today because I have gained so much weight and bloat.
24	724	My doctor said I have gained 10 lbs and need to remove NuvaRing.
24	725	I think I gained about 10 lbs while taking it, but I don't think that was due to the birth control, my husband also never noticed it during sex, added bonus;) I wish I could take it while breastfeeding, but my doctor doesn't recommend it.
24	726	I ride my bike 16 miles daily and have still gained a pound.
24	727	I gained 20 pounds.
24	728	In that year I gained almost 30 pounds and have had insane mood swings.
24	729	The one and only complaint is that I have gained a good 10 pounds.
24	730	I never experienced any negative side effects and I never gained any weight.
24	731	I have gained about 6lbs (from 110 to 116) in that three months.
24	732	I also gained a cup size and my breasts are CONSTANTLY sore/tender.
24	733	But I noticed my appetite increased and I gained 40 lbs.
24	734	I gained maybe 10 pounds, and two cup sizes.
24	735	BUT I have gained a little weight.. not much, but I think that's because I lost weight when I started the pills.
24	736	Prior to the ring I used different birth control pills (Ortho, Yasmin), all of which my body did not respond well to, as I gained weight and felt like I had weird mood swings.
24	737	However I will take that over the 15  pounds I gained while on the pill.
24	738	I haven't gained any weight or had terrible mood swings.
24	739	It is hard to say if I gained any weight because I was on it for so long but when I did go off of it I noticed I dropped a few pounds and had a little more energy.
24	740	Only side effects are I gained 15 pounds but I wanted to do that's probably why I gained so much.
24	741	I gained 20 lbs.
24	742	I was on Yaz before for 2 years then I switched because I had gained a lot of weight.
24	743	I also gained a lot of weight, my periods were terrible along with never on time.
24	744	I've had mood swings, felt very depressed and gained weight.
24	745	I gained about 20 lbs while on it for 6 months.
24	746	I've gained 15 pounds since I started taking NuvaRing 3 months ago.
24	747	I gained fifteen pounds in two months.
24	748	The best part was that it made me lose all of the water weight I had gained on another type of birth control.
24	749	I have not gained weight or had any significant side effects.
24	750	I asked my NP about it, and she agreed it would be a good plan to treat my PCOS, as well to prevent pregnancy,  I'm on my second week and so far I haven't gained weight, but actually  lost 5 pounds without trying.
24	751	When I began the NuvaRing in 2007 or early 2008 I absolutely loved it because I didn't have to take a pill everyday and taking the birth control pill made me nauseous and I gained a lot of weight.
24	752	With NuvaRing I gained no weight at all the first time around.
24	753	I've tried Ortho Tri-cyclen (hated it, gained a lot of weight that took many years to take off), Tri-Norinyl (liked this but still had to take a pill everyday), Paraguard IUD (hurt for the 1st week then was fine, expelled it after 3 months though).
24	754	Also, I've gained nearly 40 pounds despite being more active than ever.
24	755	I have gained a few pounds, but that's no big deal, because it beats thinking I am pregnant every month or that I'm going to die from losing so much blood.
24	756	I've been depressed ever since I started, nausea every once in a while but literally crying my eyes out every single day.
24	757	I have serious feelings of depression, no appetite, nausea after eating, and NO ENERGY!
24	758	I was on it for 6 months with few side effects (vaginal discharge and itchiness, mild nausea and the occasional dizzy spell.
24	759	Additionally, during my second month I did have a case of nausea and vomiting for about two days; I'm not sure where this stemmed from though.
24	760	at the beginning I had some nausea and dizziness this lasted about 2 days.
24	761	The bad so far is: a little nausea, and definitely some dizziness which is improving.
24	762	No nausea.
24	763	Monthlong bleeding, nausea, dizziness, lower back and leg pain.
24	764	The side effects that I endured with nausea and breast tenderness for the first month.
24	765	The only thing I'd have to say that I didn't like at first with this birth control was the nausea, dizziness and mood swing I had within the first (about) three months.
24	766	I also experienced nausea and/or vomiting everyday.
24	767	My only side effect I dislike is the nausea.
24	768	Im trying to look past the extreme nausea---but if i did not have that i wouldve been happy with Nuvaring.
24	769	However, after about 10 days in, I experienced panic, tingling, nausea, increased irritability, moodiness and signs of depression.
24	770	The nausea has subsided, but the gas still comes back occasionally.
24	771	So far I already thought I was pregnant because I had nausea and extreme salivation.
24	772	I started on the oral contraceptive pill but got horrible nausea and vomiting, so this was my next option.
24	773	NuvaRing has been fantastic, it has a fraction of the hormones and I get no nausea.
24	774	And the only side effect that I noticed was nausea.
24	775	I did experience some of the nausea the first week but it quickly went away with time.
24	776	First birth control I've ever been on and I have had little to no side effects with the only tangible ones being weight loss ( lost 5lbs ) & some mood swings or nausea during my first week of inserting Nuvaring and the night after I take it out.
24	777	I really loved the NUVARING...the only side effect that I had experience was slight nausea at the beginning.
24	778	The nausea and diarrhea are always worse just after I've eaten.
24	779	The only side effect I experience a lot from is nausea.
24	780	The only down side so far has been the nausea I get in the mornings.
24	781	Been on the pill for 20 yrs and over the past few years have noticed more nausea.
24	782	It's expensive but worth it to me because I no longer experience nausea, break through bleeding, or deal with having to take a pill every day.
24	783	I experienced nausea and fatigue and as the days progressed things became somewhat worse.
24	784	I randomly get nausea and cannot eat.
24	785	I'm assuming though that the thorough disgust and nausea at the sight, smell and taste of hamburger last night is because the ring has the same hormones as being pregnant.
24	786	I have nausea, I vomited once, and tender breasts.
24	787	I also get nausea the day after I insert a new ring, though I think that would fade if I kept using NuvaRing.
24	788	Nuvaring made me so nauseated I was throwing up for 2 weeks straight.
24	789	I've also been tired, cranky, nauseated and I never want sex.
24	790	My only complaint is that the second day after putting it in I feel nauseated and when I take it out, I get really moody by the third day.
24	791	I had it in for less than one week because I became extremely depressed, crying spells, constipated, and nauseated.
24	792	I tried 3 times every time i was on it my stomach hurt so bad and I felt nauseous.
24	793	The first month I felt slightly nauseous the second and third day of being on the ring.
24	794	After that I was so nauseous I was constantly  taking zofran and reglan and could barely function.
24	795	So I put the ring in on the first day of my period, 2 days later my period stopped and I am feeling nauseous, very tired, lost in appetite, and some discharge.
24	796	It also made me very nauseous and throw up quite a lot.
24	797	I got more depressed than I ever had in my life (I've struggled for years, but this was different) and I was nauseous after every time I ate, so I just stopped eating.
24	798	I started using NR because oral contraceptives made me extremely nauseous so my dr suggested skipping the GI tract all together.
24	799	I'm nauseous and hungry at the same time.
24	800	I felt nauseous and weird.
24	801	I had it in for a week and then every now and then would feel slightly nauseous.
24	802	I am nauseous all the time, especially the first couple of days after putting it in.
24	803	My breasts hurt all the time I feel nauseous and sick constantly and the smells of certain food make me sick.
24	804	I've gotten moody, sore and I'm nauseous beyond belief.
24	805	Then only down side was the side effects, I'm a pretty tiny girl (5"7 under 120 pounds) and the ring made me really nauseous, unbelievably tired, my entire body was sore especially in my legs and overall made me feel a little weird.
24	806	The first 3 months when I put the ring in after the ring free break, I would be very nauseous because my body didn't have the hormones for a week, that was a downside.
24	807	Is extremely nauseous, loss of appiette and bad heartburn.
24	808	For the first week and a half though, I was very nauseous and felt like I needed to throw up and I was very gassy!
24	809	The only downside is it makes me very nauseous when I first put a new one in.
24	810	The pills make me sick and I feel nauseous all the time.
24	811	All birth control makes me nauseous but the Nuvaring is not nearly as bad as the others.
24	812	I'm nauseous a lot.
24	813	I have been very emotional, have bad anxiety, shaking of hands and whole body, very nauseous all the time.
24	814	I have been constantly nauseous with no appetite at all.
24	815	I admit, I feel tired and nauseous but that is probably because I have not been on birth control for 3 months since I was not sexually active during that time.
24	816	I've been so dizzy and my stomach has hurt so bad I couldn't even get out of bed.
24	817	I am a little more tired then usual and sometimes have dizzy spells.
24	818	I have had aches, vomiting, pains in my abdomen and I was very very dizzy.
24	819	I ended up feeling dizzy and lightheaded and moody and not motivated to have sex.
24	820	But I'm not nearly so dizzy as I was on the pill.
24	821	Over time though, I started to experience worse and worse heart palpitations, dizziness, anxiety and paranoia.
24	822	Within 24 hours of using the NuvaRing, I had severe stomach pain and dizziness that would not seem to go away.
24	823	When I was first on it I had extreme dizziness.
24	824	My advice for everyone that's having different mood swing .
24	825	Sure, I get the occasional mood swing, however this is nothing unmanageable.
24	826	I also had a very very slight mood swing, nothing that I can't handle, but it went away after 2 weeks or so.
24	827	For the first month I did have more mood swings and increased anxiety/depression, however I was in a bad situation so I think it just amplified it.
24	828	So I kept using it and by the 4th month no mood swings or side effects.
24	829	I was on NuvaRing for about 3 months and had to stop taking it because of the ridiculous mood swings I was having.
24	830	Only issue was the mood swings that drove me absolutely insane lol.
24	831	It is definitely very convenient, however I developed severe mood swings and anxiousness while on this form of birth control.
24	832	The reason I ultimately got off of it was because after 7 months of severe anxiety, mood swings, and angry outburst with no explanation, I figured out that it could potentially be my Nuva Ring.
24	833	I had a few mood swings, which was different than my regular monthly moodiness.
24	834	Uncontrollable mood swings.
24	835	I noticed a little lethargy and some mood swings, but not bad.
24	836	It has caused me severe anxiety, mood swings, uncontrollable crying, severe panic attacks.
24	837	I'm emotional, anything can make me cry, and I continue to have frequent mood swings.
24	838	I stopped using it because I noticed that during the months of usage, I experienced extreme depression,& mood swings.
24	839	Now I am 4 months in and I lost appetite (which all in all is not a bad thing), I have terrible mood swings and got extremely teary and depressed.
24	840	I had horrible mood swings, and it made my anxiety and depression so much worse.
24	841	I'm four days days in, and the mood swings are terrible.
24	842	I have no history of depression or mood swings.
24	843	I am not having any depression, but I am super irritable, and have mood swings.
24	844	I also feel like I'm having crazy mood swings angry ones.
24	845	However, the NuvaRing gives me crazy mood swings every month like clockwork.
24	846	Breastart are always tender, no mood swings, appetite changes, weight loss/gain.
24	847	On top of that, my mood swings are INSANE.
24	848	I haven't had any weight/appetite gain, mood swings or massive fatigue.
24	849	My mood swings were unpredictable and nasty.
24	850	This BC gives me the most extreme mood swings I have ever experienced.
24	851	If you already have mood swings, anxiety and or a history of depression please search for other options because this thing will intensify what you have like no other.
24	852	I've never been on bc prior to this and I did mention to the dr if it'll make your mood swings worse and she assured me it wouldn't.
24	853	I feel like I already struggled with some depression and mood swings but being on this just takes it to a whole other level.
24	854	I've also noticed extreme mood swings that third week it's in.
24	855	I have mood swings and struggle with anxiety regulation but I'm not sure that these issues are due to the birth control.
24	856	I had tried a variety of different pills, but I experienced terrible mood swings on most.
24	857	I like the Nuvaring because it does not cause me to experience  those  mood  swings, I have lighter and shorter periods and it is convenient  not to have to take a pill everyday.
24	858	I still have mood swings sometimes, but I think it's just an age thing.
24	859	I had commented before and I also wanted to say that I haven't experienced any mood swings and I STILL WANT TO HAVE SEX!
24	860	The 2nd month I started having crazy mood swings, and bloating.
24	861	I experience extreme mood swings, I'm a lot more angry, I find myself depressed, have random urges to cry and my periods are just as painful as before.
24	862	I am naturally a moody person and I love food so I can't say my mood swings or being overweight can be blamed on NuvaRing.
24	863	I tried Nuvaring in Oct 2012 and stopped it July 2013 because of mood swings and bloating.
24	864	Went back on the Nuvaring in Sept 2013 and all was fine for the first 2 months but month 3 I got my mood swings back and I am so irritable that any tiny thing annoys me.
24	865	Has had mood swings - happy to sad and vice versa.
24	866	I had breakthrough bleeding all 3 weeks, head-ach's, anxiety , insane mood swings - felt like crying or got super angry at the drop of a hat, not sure if this is attributed to the nuvaring but I lost about 12 lbs in a month.
24	867	Hopefully I can get over the mood swings because other than that I believe the NuvaRing was the best choice for me.
24	868	Within two weeks I had very bad mood swings, I was anxious and paranoid all the time.
24	869	Although it is extremely convenient, I have had the worst mood swings EVER.
24	870	The mood swings over power the convenience of the NR for me.
24	871	I almost immediately experienced major mood swings, crying, getting offended by things that normally don't bother me.
24	872	So far I feel my mood swings have actually balanced out.
24	873	I felt mood swings before and I was on no birth control.
24	874	I also have experienced mood swings and last summer I had sun spots on my face (NEVER had those before!).
24	875	I'm going to stop using it soon because I'm tired of the mood swings!
24	876	Aside from not being able to get as wet and some random mood swings, I think it's great!
24	877	I also have times of severe mood swings and depression.
24	878	No mood swings.
24	879	No mood swings, I feel great and for a long time I can predict when my menses will come (have been irregular from the start).
24	880	No mood swings yet and I start next week.
24	881	I feel so bad because I made my boyfriend go through a lot with my awful mood swings.
24	882	No mood swings or depression.
24	883	No mood swings for me or weight gain/loss but....
24	884	I've been on about 6 different types of pills since 2008 and each has made me extremely irritable with horrible mood swings.
24	885	I gave this a 5 out of 10 because I haven't noticed any weight changes or mood swings which is a huge plus.
24	886	No daily pill, no sickness, mood swings, or breakouts.
24	887	I have had a few mood swings but most women have them.
24	888	My mood swings weren't bad, my periods were regular but it became uncomfortable.
24	889	It made my skin the best it's ever been in my life and I had no weird side effects like mood swings and depression.
24	890	I can put it in once and forget about it, and its low dose means no more mood swings from birth control!
24	891	I have had breakouts the entire time, lower back aches, HORRIBLE mood swings, it has slipped out more than once, and given me terrible anxiety.
24	892	The first week I had really bad mood swings because my doctor told me to take it while I was PMSing about 1 week before I was supposed to get my period which I knew was going to happen.
24	893	I was on "the pill" and it made me very ill, depressed, and gave me mood swings.
24	894	That didn't matter since I also had bleeding, mood swings and felt so bloated I doubt I was all that sexy to my husband anyway.
24	895	Now, I do have mood swings, but that is normal for women, regardless what birth control methods you use.
24	896	My mood swings have disappeared.
24	897	I have had no real mood swings as opposed to the pill.
24	898	No mood swings for me.
24	899	I have had bad experiences, in terms of mood swings and depression, with many different birth control pills but I am enjoying the ring.
24	900	Well, with what I have noticed with the Nuvaring is that I'm having HORRIBLE mood swings.
24	901	Other birth control products cause crazy mood swings for me but with this one none.
24	902	One negative thing is mood swings I can get very emotional and cry over the littlest things.
24	903	I do recommend it for most people who want easy birth control, but I do warn of the mood swings.
24	904	But my boyfriend may never want to come near me again because of my AWFUL mood swings.
24	905	I experienced terrible mood swings, and spent entire random days feeling like I could cry about everything.
24	906	It was my boyfriend who finally pointed out that maybe my extreme mood swings that coincidentally started when I began using the ring could be attributed to it.
24	907	I definitely recommend it for those who have mood swings or tiredness while on the pill and need a low-dose hormonal birth control option.
24	908	Lack of sexual drive, mood swings, very sensitive, breast grew a cup size but is always very tender.
24	909	Hubby was pleased with the bigger breast but upset with the mood swings and lack of sexual interest.
24	910	Worst of all is the depression and mood swings.
24	911	I chose Nuvaring because I knew I couldn't be trusted with taking a pill everyday but wanted birth control to help regulate my periods, ease mood swings, and clear skin.
24	912	(I did have mood swings that might be attributable to it, but it's hard to say, since there were other factors involved.)
24	913	It has also evened out my up and down hormone mood swings but it's difficult to use when I am away traveling for a few weeks and happen to be needing to place the next one in.
24	914	I was excited to have my period shortened to a day a month with clear skin while also being protected from pregnancy so the mood change wasn't a big deal.
24	915	It's been a year and a half now I've had no break outs, no unnatural mood changes, a lighter menstruation but my drive has had decreased some that could be not being as active (busy life).
24	916	Don't feel ashamed or embarrassed that your mood changes!
24	917	But those were mild issues compared to the mood changes that started in month 7.
24	918	Everyone is different so it may not cause any mood changes or side effects for you.
24	919	I did notice slight mood changes at first, but my moodiness eventually went away.
24	920	I have just taken the nuvaring out (cannot get hold of doctor until monday) as the first month on it I found my mood changed.
24	921	I tend to be nervous about doing something like that but it was just awful.
24	922	What really made me nervous was my eyes felt like I had a fog over them, I took it out and flushed it down the toilet.
24	923	I was nervous about it because I still have not found anything wrong.
24	924	I was nervous at first about the hormonal side effects and scary articles online about the Nuva, but decided for it because of the convenience!
24	925	After reading 107 reviews on the ring and about 100 of them being bad experiences I was very nervous to try the ring.
24	926	I started using this product after my 1st child was born at age 19, at first I was a bit nervous about the side effects and all but after a few months of using it I was relieved of how awesome it worked.
24	927	I was very nervous to try it in the beginning because I had read so many bad reviews.
24	928	No suprise pregnacy and believe me their have been some times where I was scared and nervous that I was.
24	929	I was a little nervous to get on NuvaRing because it stays in the vagina for 3 weeks and I had read about vaginal infections but so far I am happy with it!
24	930	At first I was a little nervous about using it.
24	931	It's my first attempt at hormonal birth control, so I was a little nervous about side effects.
24	932	My skin was clear & I didn't get pregnant or gain weight but I got severely depressed & anxious on the pill.
24	933	First, while I am not feeling depressed or anxious, I have noticed that I am a little more easily angered.
24	934	Two days after starting I began feeling anxious and depressed.
24	935	That being said, after about six months of use, I realized that I was noticeably more anxious, depressed, and emotional.
24	936	I'm depressed all the time, anxious all the time, and I get mad at my boyfriend for no reason at all.
24	937	The suicidal thoughts come when I'm most anxious it just flat out sucks man.
24	938	But as time went on I started feeling sad and depressed and anxious.
24	939	I feel anxious all the time.
24	940	I would feel angry for no reason (like PMS) all throughout the month, I would cry at the drop of a hat, and I started feeling anxious 24/7.
24	941	My anxiety is so high I lay awake at night and can’t get my mind off it.
24	942	I also feel like it increases my anxiety & depression a ton!
24	943	However, I have been over come with horrible anxiety.
24	944	When the anxiety got so bad that I couldn't sleep at night I took it out and felt much better within 2 days.
24	945	I have had it for 2 months and I’ve taken it out after a week each time due to increased blood pressure, anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
24	946	I am a very positive/motivated person with absolutely no history of anxiety or depression.
24	947	Was going to therapy 2 times a week for 4 months, trying to figure out what triggered my anxiety.
24	948	Where I've had problems with anxiety before, I more frequently have panic attacks, a rapid heartbeat, and a tight chest.
24	949	7 months in and I'm a full blown basket case with life ruining depression and anxiety.
24	950	I took this and literally an hour after I put it in I had a major rush of heat and felt like I had been hit with depression, anxiety and had a panic attack as a result.
24	951	I've had anxiety and panic attacks before and I've never felt like that before.
24	952	I feel lost, confused and it's very hard for me to feel happy without feelings of anxiety and panic overcoming me.
24	953	I have recurring negative thoughts that give me anxiety that I cannot stop.
24	954	I used to be on BeYaz but couldn't stand the mood alteration and it was making my anxiety levels very high.
24	955	For 2 mnth I thought I was going to lose it with anxiety from 'coming down', but I am pleased to report I've never felt better in my life, and my partner doesn't even know he's wearing a condom!
24	956	Depression and anxiety were a big issue.
24	957	I've been using Nuvaring for about 3 months now and I thought that the extremely bad anxiety was cause by other problems and that it'd go away but it hasn't and has only gotten worse.
24	958	When I first started using the ring I had absolutely horrible anxiety for about 2 weeks.
24	959	The one plus was that my moods were great on NuvaRing and my anxiety decreased.
24	960	Within 2 weeks I had severe anxiety and depression with suicidal thoughts.
24	961	The second month on the ring, I experienced off and on anxiety, depression at times, unmotivated, and just not like myself.
24	962	I decided to try a pill and got severe anxiety attacks.
24	963	It's too bad because it actually helped my anxiety and it was so convenient.
24	964	Ortho gave me really bad anxiety too.
24	965	Once I switched to Nuvaring, my anxiety went away, my moods are super under control, and I have lost 5 lbs very easily in the past month.
24	966	I lost all the bloat as well as the depression and anxiety when I came off it.
24	967	It increased my anxiety quite a bit especially when I was tired.
24	968	I have issues with anxiety and so I feared that going on birth control would play (negatively) with my mood/anxiety.
24	969	I also would suffer from a sense of anxiety before I fell asleep.
24	970	However, my skin became PERFECT and anxiety went away after a month.
24	971	It gave me anxiety, depression to the point where I felt hopeless and like I had no control of anything so I discontinued using it and side affects are going away and I feel like I have control again.
24	972	I also have horrible breast pain.
24	973	I get a little breast tenderness, but nothing that doesn't happen during a normal monthly cycle, without birth control.
24	974	At first, the side effects I experienced were breast tenderness and vaginal irritation.
24	975	Only issues is breast tenderness a week before my period that can get annoying but otherwise this birth control has been great and super easy to remember.
24	976	The only side effects I have experienced are breast tenderness, being really dry or really wet at times and possible uti's.
24	977	However I would have to say the worst side effect is the Breast tenderness.
24	978	I did notice breast tenderness when using the NuvaRing.
24	979	The dryness is terrible, breast tenderness almost daily.
24	980	I also experienced breast tenderness mid cycle and have thrush now which may not be related to the Nuvaring but rather to too much loving over the weekend.
24	981	I felt sick for about a week plus breast tenderness.
24	982	I have had tender breasts since inserting it, but I'm actually a big fan of that feeling.
24	983	Other than that I had swollen but non tender breasts.
24	984	I was on the pill and had bad side effects - swollen, tender breasts and moody.
24	985	Side effects: tender breasts, breast growth.
24	986	Maybe a day or two after inserting the Nuvaring I began having sore breasts.
24	987	I had zero side effects besides sore breasts.
24	988	My breasts hurt 24/7.
24	989	I've never had a yeast infection, and this is my first time trying birth control.
24	990	It's ok but I started to develop a yeast infection after two weeks
24	991	However around day 4 on it I got a yeast infection from hell.
24	992	Before the Nuvaring I only had one yeast infection in my whole life and Monistat cleared it up without a problem.
24	993	I have dryness and irritation in my lady parts kinda sucks feeling you got a yeast infection 24 hours a day and sex is not so great.
24	994	My one complaint: the first 2 months of the ring I had slight vaginal pain kinda like a yeast infection & an increase in discharge.
24	995	The second month I developed a horrible yeast infection a few days after insertion.
24	996	A few days after insertion a horrible yeast infection!
24	997	The Nuvaring was perfect for me except for ONE thing- it caused me to have a yeast infection.
24	998	I was tested for urinary infection and yeast infection and the doctor did not find anything.
24	999	It also seemed to make me more likely to develop a yeast infection.
24	1000	However, by about month 6, I had two yeast infections that I couldn't cure.
24	1001	I loved it because it was easy to place and you forget that you even have it "there"; but I had to stop using it because I was having yeast infections every single month- I was miserable and the medication that my doctor prescribed wasn't doing any better.
24	1002	I went to the doctor for possible bacterial infections, yeast infections, but none were the cause.
24	1003	I might be a little more snippy, and I have had issues with yeast infections.
24	1004	I never get yeast infections and got one on the ring.
24	1005	It got rid of my reoccurring yeast infections, I even grew a cup size.
24	1006	I had yeast infections a least 3 times a month.
24	1007	I used it for about 7 months and it gave me terrible terrible yeast infections and was just not comfortable to wear.
24	1008	I was on it for 4 years but decided to switch because I started getting recurring bacterial vaginitis right before my period each month.
25	1	I never really had acne breakouts while I was on it.
25	2	No weight gain or acne, but my anxiety was through the roof.
25	3	First 5 months were fine, cleared up my acne, regulated my periods and prevented pregnancy.
25	4	I never got acne so that hasn't been a problem for me.
25	5	It also made me have really bad head aches and  acne.
25	6	It has been almost a week since I've stopped taking it and my mood and acne has cleared up.
25	7	I haven't gained any weight, my acne cleared up and I've never had a pregnancy scare while on this pill even after unprotected sex with my boyfriend.
25	8	No acne, weight gain or mood swings.
25	9	My skin is also acne prone, and I was really hoping that this birth control would help with it.
25	10	Without the pill, I usually have many bumps on my forehead, my chin is pretty red, and once in a while I will get cystic acne.
25	11	It's also given me MORE cystic acne which is a pain.
25	12	Aviane was perfect for me no acne, perfect moods, energy, and a good appetite (I need weight gain).
25	13	The first week of Orsythia consisted of meltdowns, frequent headaches, dizziness, slight nausea, and acne lots of acne.
25	14	I've been on this pill for 4 months now and it's made my acne worse than ever.
25	15	I do not get acne, or crazy mood swings, or anything of that sort on this pill.
25	16	I did NOT gain any weight, lose my sex drive, get acne, have mood swings, PMS symptoms or most importantly get pregnant on this birth control.
25	17	No spotting, no weight gain, and no acne issues.
25	18	It didn't clear up my acne but it didn't make it any worse, I've had no mood swings, no cramps, no pms symptoms, no bloating, really no side effects at all.
25	19	My acne has been so much worse I feel like I'm back in high school.
25	20	It prevented pregnancy, my acne cleared up and I lost a little weight.
25	21	It cleared up my acne, helps with my anxiety, and has done a wonderful job at preventing pregnancy!
25	22	Secondly, it made my acne blow up for the first 4 months I was on it!
25	23	Worst, is the cystic acne on my chin.
25	24	Some other side effects have been weight gain (only about 3-5 pounds but still), and horrible acne in the first 3 months.
25	25	After about 6 months my acne became worse than it has ever been, but even that wasn't the worst of it.
25	26	I normally have nice skin and it has gone completely to hell - pimples and cystic acne on the lower half of my face.
25	27	BUT a few months into it I noticed I had no sex drive, heavier periods, minor acne flare ups (I didn't have acne before), & extreme mood swings.
25	28	I have so much hormonal acne on my chin and neck, it has NEVER been this bad.
25	29	My periods are great but I do not recommend this for acne.
25	30	But while I was sexually active I barely had any acne, didn't gain any weight, and had no problems with my sex drive.
25	31	I was given this to treat my cystic acne, and severe mood swings due to PMDD.
25	32	My acne vanished, my skin texture changed (for the better), and I no longer lash out at anyone for simply calling my name.
25	33	I stopped after a year, took a break and started it again and both times I had terrible outbreaks all over my chest and face even though I had never had acne before.
25	34	I wish it didn't do that because I would like to stay on it but I can't handle the acne it gives me.
25	35	My only complaint is the acne--I get a few cystic pimples on my chin on the weeks where I am on the active pills.
25	36	No weight gain, no acne, and no pregnancies!
25	37	well I've been taking it for about 5 months now and My acne has cleared up but sometimes i feel like it isn't working so i get pregnancy scares but my period has been shorted but my cramping is still the same.
25	38	So much acne all over my neck and chin area.
25	39	Going to stop this week, I am acne prone so this just ruined my skin that had been fine for a long time.
25	40	It did exactly what it's supposed to do, but the acne it caused me just wasn't worth it.
25	41	It do help with my cramps and my period, not so much my acne but it's better.
25	42	Then came the bloating, weight gain and acne.
25	43	No pregnancies, no weight gain, and no acne (though I wasn't prone to it before).
25	44	My acne was getting worse as well but it's a good thing it has cleared up.
25	45	I have experienced severe mood swings and temperament, depression, bloating, AWFUL chest, back, and facial acne, and constant food cravings.
25	46	My acne is worse and my mood is awful.
25	47	Absolutely horrible, painful acne, whereas normally my acne is under control.
25	48	Recently I've started to get the bad acne everyone mentions.
25	49	This worked as birth control but it made me break out with the worst acne I've ever had all over my face.
25	50	I got horrible acne all over my chin!
25	51	It didn't really help with my acne, I think the first week of the pack (after the placebos) my face would be flawless and the rest of the days it would be breakouts.
25	52	No weight gain, mood swings, acne, or nausea!
25	53	No more cramps or acne, and my periods are now super light!
25	54	I don't know if it's the birth control but ever since I've started taking it, my acne has been under control, I've lost weight, and my breasts seem a little bigger!
25	55	I was previously on Tri- Previfem, and had horrible acne, cramps, and mood swings on it.
25	56	My acne is totally gone, I've gotten one pimple this month (I would get 7-10 while on Tri-Previfem.
25	57	I just recently switched from Minastrin Fe to Orysthia so far the only problem I have had with it is much more acne, the good side to it is that I only get my period for about three days and so far I haven't had any spotting.
25	58	I'm going to stick it out for a couple of months to see if the whole acne issue goes away.
25	59	I've never had acne.
25	60	I have also had a little more acne than usual.
25	61	I've had a little bit of acne but it's not that bad.
25	62	But it worked great no acne or bleeding.
25	63	I have been taking this birth control for 3 days and I can already tell what the side effects are, I have horrible nausea and have been vomiting, My legs and feet are swollen, I have started getting acne on my jawline, and I have been having the worst cramps ever.
25	64	I haven't had any problems so far with acne and my appetite has actually decreased.
25	65	During the first few months my acne got really bad and I almost got off the pill, but then it went away around month 3 and my skin is pretty clear.
25	66	No acne, I lost weight and my sex drive shot through the roof!!
25	67	I've noticed breakouts of acne along my jawline and some random ones on my upper lip, some weight gain.
25	68	The positives for me about it are that I don't have cramps at all, I have a period for only 3 or 4 days and my acne cleared up really well.
25	69	I switched to this from Loestrin FE 1/20 and got my sex drive back, acne cleared up, and I barely notice that I am on this pill.
25	70	Weight that I just can't seem to shed, hormonal acne on my jawline and neck, no sex drive, and really awful moodiness and depression.
25	71	I've had no acne, no weight gain, no mood swings, no pain, short and light periods, no spotting, and NO PREGNANCIES.
25	72	No weight gain, no acne (actually, less acne).
25	73	I've broken out with acne like a teenager, my sex drive has decreased, mood swings, increased appetite and weight gain.
25	74	Orsythia/Alesse has helped my mood and my adult acne.
25	75	Most birth control pills that I have been on have cleared my acne completely, but I all of a sudden had severe breakouts, especially on my chin, while on this medication.
25	76	I had little to no side effects with Lutera, now I have mood swings, acne under my chin, my cycle used to be every 28 days, now my periods are irregular.
25	77	Then my insurance switched to Orysthia and I've been having mood swings, acne, and what seems like, 3 week periods.
25	78	No acne, no mood swings, no period changes.
25	79	The doctor said it was one of the side effects, in addition to my face breaking out.
25	80	Within days my face began breaking out like crazy.
25	81	My face recently started breaking out but maybe I need more water.
25	82	I have been on orsythia for a year, I use to get pimples every month before this pill now I rarely get them.
25	83	Now that I've been taking it, I have many new pimples all over my face, like my cheeks and on my nose, where I have never gotten it before.
25	84	I started getting side effects right away: pimples everywhere, would feel nauseous after I would take the pill, and felt bloated all day.
25	85	I'm 43 and have pimples on my chin and forehead (never had it before).
25	86	After reading a lot of the comments I noticed people were only unsatisfied with it because of pimples and weight gain.
25	87	I also never get pimples and I have had about 6 in the past 3 months.
25	88	I still get a few little pimples every now and then but not as bad as I used to.
25	89	I don’t have very noticeable cramps but Tylenol helps take them away.
25	90	I was originally on Microgestin Fe 1/20 using it for my period and birth control, I had very few cramps and very light bleeding with no side effects.
25	91	I started taking Orsythia for unbearable menstrual cramps, and stayed on it for about 6 months.
25	92	This pill does wonders for cramps, but I would not recommend it to anyone with a history of anxiety issues.
25	93	For me, orsynthia has stopped the clotting during my periods but I still will get cramps and my periods will sometimes be very heavy.
25	94	It did not help my cramps as much as I thought it was going to.
25	95	I have noticed less intense period cramps and decreased flow, which is nice.
25	96	My cramps are the same and periods have not become shorter.
25	97	I started birth control my junior year of high school to help with heavy cramps.
25	98	Best birth control ever.... Lost weight and help with cramps doing period
25	99	It regulated my periods really well, reduced and shortened bleeding, and completely got rid of my cramps.
25	100	This past year has been a completely different me, my sex drive was fine, bad cramps only once and then other time from the white week sticker falling off and accidentally missing some pills.
25	101	While my periods have been lighter and shorter, cramps have gotten worse.
25	102	I have been on it for about 6 months, and it is great except for the fact that it makes me extremely emotional the day before my period and I have cramps on my period.
25	103	I would only have about four day periods and I barely ever had cramps.
25	104	My periods were short and light and I didn't experience any cramps.
25	105	This birth control never did anything to lighten my period, but it did help regulate it and my cramps stopped.
25	106	I use to get bad back pain and cramps however after starting the pill, they are gone and my period only lasts 3-4 days.
25	107	I don't get cramps anymore and I have a very light, short period.
25	108	Now the pros of this brand is that I haven't had bad cramps like I used to.
25	109	I have had calf cramps as well.
25	110	I used to get extremely heavy periods and very severe cramps, and I was looking for a birth control pill that would help with it.
25	111	My problems with cramps and heavy periods went away within three months, and there was a definite improvement right when I started taking it.
25	112	I don't have any cramps or feel any more tired than usual.
25	113	I have no cramps, period starts normally on my third day of my blue pill, when I remember to take them it last about three days its super light.
25	114	My doctor prescribed it to help control my terrible PMS and cramps.
25	115	I was a day 1 starter and immediately I felt relief from cramps.
25	116	No headaches, lighter cramps and shorter period days (3/4).
25	117	No cramps, no mood swings, no headaches, and FREE!
25	118	I have been on three other birth controls before this one (stopped because they were discontinued) and have never had any problems with any of them which just shows that I am not prone to mood swings or break outs, cramps, etc., so this pill worked for me personally but may not work for just anyone.
25	119	My sex drive is great, but I have a lot of cramps and breast tenderness.
25	120	Only thing is my periods are a bit heavier and more cramps.
25	121	I do have bad cramps again, but I've always had cramps.
25	122	I have never experienced cramps this bad.
25	123	The only good thing is that Ive barely had any cramps.
25	124	I had no problems when on Aviane or Lutera, but since my insurance switched me to Orsythia, my periods have gotten a bit longer, and my cramps have gotten worse.
25	125	I've had headaches, moodiness, and cramps.
25	126	My first period only lasted about two & a half days, I had no cramping at all and I usually cramp before.& during my period, I also had unprotected sex 'exactly' 7 days after beginning the pill, so it's safe to say that it does the job at preventing pregnancy, it's just the side effects that make it so horrible.
25	127	I just don't cramp as much anymore.
25	128	Sure I get an occasional pimple or cramp but can we look at the bigger picture?
25	129	My periods were not affected by Orsythia, but I did notice it helped reduce cramping.
25	130	It immediately regulated my period and made the cramping almost disappear, but some of the side effects made it not worth it.
25	131	I had bad anxiety, more cramping during my period, I spotted all the time, during the 4th month I had another period during the middle of the pack for no reason and I was very angry and emotional as well as sad and lazy.
25	132	My period started the 3rd day of placebo pills and I had mild cramping.
25	133	I would also get frequent headaches, like maybe 4 a week, There was more cramping too.
25	134	Previously I was dealing with ten day periods and very horrid cramping every other month.
25	135	Right after I started to take the pill, I had the same symptoms as I do during period such as cramping.
25	136	I used to have really bad cramping and a really heavy flow before I started this birth control.
25	137	It has eliminated my breast tenderness and cramping though - that's why I strayed on it.
25	138	Then by the third week I started to feel mild cramping in my calf and sharp pains all over my body.
25	139	I have had no cramping at all since I started (Very much unlike Loestrin) and period was light and only 3 days long ( RELIEF).
25	140	I'm constantly tired, my cramping is more painful than when I was on a different pill that was discontinued, I have 10 days periods when I used to have 3-4 day ones, headaches all the time, and absolutely no sex drive whatsoever.
25	141	with no cramping at all.
25	142	I've never had issues with cramping, though.
25	143	Now lighter, shorter with little to no cramping.
25	144	I am on my 3 months pack but all she sudden I won't stop spotting 12 days straight so far, my first 2 packs were just fine
25	145	Those side effects included breast tenderness, and spotting.
25	146	I experienced spotting the entire time I was on this pill, which I have not had happen on other pills.
25	147	I experienced spotting for around 2 weeks in my first month but my period regulated after that.
25	148	I went to planned parenthood where they prescribed me Orsythia, and the doctor mentioned to me that spotting, nausea, & feeling "funny" were the most common side effects.
25	149	Well, my cycle did not come and all I had was some spotting.
25	150	On the 9th day, I started to bleed but like a spot (still need a pad).
25	151	I also actually have a noticeable period and no longer spot throughout the month.
25	152	I think the only bad thing is that I spot before I start the last week of pills.
25	153	Some of the symptoms I have experience are: Calf Cramps, headache, continuous nauseas,  body ache as if I was getting the flue, headaches....
25	154	I was nervous taking this med after reading negative reviews but, after a rough first week that included nausea (quelled by taking Dramamine) a nasty headache, having my face break out (I am 46 and do NOT get break outs), and then break through bleeding...everything calmed and I've loved the medicine ever since.
25	155	I have been on this medication for a month now and I have only had headaches and extreme tiredness, some problems being mad for no reason.
25	156	I had mild nausea and headaches with this pill for the first 3 months but that's it.
25	157	The worst part for me was the headaches, I would get them daily and the pain was unbearable.
25	158	Some headaches would last days and interfere with my sleep.
25	159	I had frequent headaches and I gained 15 pounds when I had never had any major weight changes before that.
25	160	As of recently I have been experiencing a lot more headaches and migraines, which my doctor warned me about (since I have family and personal history of severe migraines).
25	161	I've experienced headaches more often, weight gain (10 lbs), water retention and bloating, my mood has changed radically, I snap all the time for no good reason, irrational agitation, irritability.
25	162	And it was the worst so many symptoms like headaches and nausea and always so hungry.
25	163	I guess I didn't notice earlier but I started to get slight headaches and I didn't feel very well physically and mentally.
25	164	When I first started this Birth Control I had very bad headaches for the first 3 or 4 months.
25	165	As soon as I started taking this, I began getting headaches, nausea, dizziness and my skin completely broke out.
25	166	Since I've been taking the pill after giving birth and suddenly I get car sick easy I get headaches all the time and my stomach gets crazy sick.
25	167	Although I have been getting a lot of headaches since I started with this pill, every day practically, relieved by Tylenol.
25	168	Plus, my breasts have been achy when they didn't use to be and I've had more headaches.
25	169	One month I was even worried I was pregnant because I was so tired, bloated and had so many headaches.
25	170	I have never experienced side effects of any kind with Lutera, but Orsythia has caused me to have frequent headaches, moodiness, and full-blown menstruation in the second week of active pills.
25	171	I thought it was work stress but I felt I was going crazy; migraines, insomnia, weeping, nausea for weeks.
25	172	I was very paranoid about taking birth control, but orsythia was a lot better for me than I expected, however if my migraines continue I will need to switch :(
25	173	This was my first experience on birth control, so I was incredibly apprehensive about the side-effect, namely: migraines, birth control, and  mood swings.
25	174	My sex drive has gone down a tiny bit but nothing noticeable.
25	175	I have not experienced mood swings, low sex drive, weight gain, or any of the other effects some other have dealt with.
25	176	I have an EXTREMELY low sex drive, to the point that I think it will ruin my relationship some day.
25	177	My sex drive  is pretty low, but it has been ever since I started taking any form of birth control about 7 months ago.
25	178	I didn't gain any unusual weight and it didn't lower my sex drive.
25	179	It made my sex drive PLUMMET.
25	180	I just started tri-previfem yesterday so I hope I can get my sex drive back!
25	181	However, I have NOO SEX DRIVE.
25	182	I'm seeing my obgyn soon because my low sex drive is hurting my relationship and makes life miserable.
25	183	Sex drive is a little bit better than Seasonale since you don't have to use lube.
25	184	I also have a healthy sex drive unlike when I was on the Nuevo ring.
25	185	After about a year or so I started gaining so much weight and experiencing mood swings, increased sex drive and tender breasts.
25	186	I switched to this type in hopes that I would be able to regain my sex drive, but I was a bit put off after seeing such terrible reviews.
25	187	I've experienced nausea, super low sex drive, tender breasts, increase of appetite, you name it!
25	188	Crazy emotions and no sex drive.
25	189	I did not experience weight gain, decreased sex drive, and my skin/monthly breakouts did not increase.
25	190	While it does its job - I'm not pregnant -  I'm constantly tired and sleepy, my sex drive is almost nonexistent now, my breasts often hurt, and the first day of my period is very painful.
25	191	Started after a terrible few months on Junel FE, when I was depressed and anxious & had no sex drive.
25	192	I also don't have any sex drive, I'm hardly ever in the mood to do anything anymore.
25	193	However, I have had little to no sex drive, some weight gain, and general moodiness here and there.
25	194	Ever since I've basically completely lost my sex drive.
25	195	I haven't gained weight, my sex drive is great, and I haven't had any random breakouts.
25	196	My sex drive is good, my weight is steady, face is clear, and I'm NOT pregnant.
25	197	So give it a try, it’s not a miracle pill, but it’s not a anxiety inducing weight gain supplement either.
25	198	The main problem I had with Orsythia was the weight gain, which was a substantial amount.
25	199	The second month I had all the same symptoms with a five pound weight gain.
25	200	I will say though, i have depression and anxiety and i have NO noticeable mood changes which is awesome:) also no weight gain!!!
25	201	I used to take Cryselle, which I was on for 2 years, and never experienced any problems with it besides weight gain, which was around 20 pounds.
25	202	Weight gain was minimal but definitely occurred.
25	203	No weight gain, in fact, I've lost 5 pounds.
25	204	Only side effects were the weight gain because my appetite increased.
25	205	Keep yourself on a healthy diet and you will not gain weight (So far no weight gain at all).
25	206	No weight gain, no depression, and my periods are much lighter and shorter.
25	207	The negative factors about this are the WEIGHT GAIN, I hate it.
25	208	I noticed significant weight gain during the past 2 weeks and am on my first period on birth control.
25	209	Since I've been switched to Orysthia, I've experienced all the unpleasant side effects: nausea, massive weight gain, (95 lb to 101 lb) breakouts and major mood swings.
25	210	I also have gained a couple pounds while on  Orsythia.
25	211	I have gained about 20 pounds since starting and I naturally am thin I weighed 94lbs before so yeah do the math.
25	212	I have gained about 25 pounds in the 2 years I've used it but I don't mind it as much as some other people.
25	213	I gained about 25 pounds in the year of taking Orsythia, and I have never gained that much weight in that time span ever before.
25	214	I haven't gained any weight, my periods are very light and about 4 days long.
25	215	I've been on this pill for 1 year and I've gained 30 pounds.
25	216	However I've gotten more sluggish and I've gained 5 pounds in the first 2 weeks on it.
25	217	I gained a few pounds the first month, but I also started lifting weights and eating a lot more to help build muscle the same time I started taking it, so I can't say definitively that the pill is what made me gain weight (and by gain weight I mean like 5 to 7 pounds--I haven't gained or lost more than 2 or 3 in the past 4 years as a high schooler so that was pretty significant for me).
25	218	I gained 45 pounds since I started taking the pill but my diet remained.
25	219	I've gained some weight (5 pounds).
25	220	On top of that I gained 30lbs within the two years of taking it.
25	221	I have not gained any weight, but my breasts have filled out a bit.
25	222	Also made me very depressed, I gained weight, craved food 24/7, and retained water and felt bloated all the time.
25	223	As soon as I went on this I broke out and gained eight pounds even though I was eating less and exercizing more and have been emotionally unavailable.
25	224	I've been on this pill for 3 months and I've gained 10 pounds.
25	225	I have been on it for three months and have gained over 10 pounds, while on my regular gym schedule.
25	226	I feel as though I may have gained some weight but its all water weight and bloat.
25	227	I have not gained ANY weight and have had zero side effects!
25	228	I gained some weight at first, but I went back down when I stopped eating as much.
25	229	Last month I was switched to Orsythia and did notice my mood changed a bit, was so hungry therefore gained 10 pounds.
25	230	I have been moody, gained weight and feel overall not good.
25	231	I gained 10 pounds (mostly water weight), had mood swings and shortness of breath.
25	232	I have only been on it 2 weeks and  I am unbelievably bloated, my clothes hardly fit, I have gained weight, (probably due to the bloating), my skin has broken out.
25	233	I have a long history of anxiety and it has not been affected by the pill, nor have I experienced any nausea.
25	234	Orsythia was the first birth control pill I had ever been on, and for the first 2-3 months I had extreme nausea when taking it, which I was warned by my doctor that that could be a side effect in the adjustment period.
25	235	At first there was some nausea but eating before taking the pill helped.
25	236	Into the second week my nausea became a little bit worse and my temper would easily be disturbed, I also experienced very bothersome breast soreness.
25	237	I switched from tri-sprintec due to side effects from that such as nausea, constant breast tenderness, and increased anxiety.
25	238	I have had issues with water-weight gain, which fluctuates between 3 and 5 pounds, and nausea.
25	239	Experienced nausea every so often (more than Aviane).
25	240	I haven't noticed any breast tenderness or nausea (and I have a SUPER sensitive stomach and am nauseated by many things).
25	241	I have been on this pill for 7 months and it is good except for the extreme nausea and it causes me to not want to eat sometimes.
25	242	The side effects im having are nightly nausea probably 4-5 nights a week.
25	243	Very slight nausea feeling when I take it, but I learned to avoid it by taking it just before I go to sleep.
25	244	Ended my 2nd month and no nausea or irregular bleeding.
25	245	I had mild nausea for the first two months and an irregular period, but my body quickly adjusted to it.
25	246	I am halfway through month two, and the fatigue, bloating and nausea are so bad I actually thought I was pregnant!
25	247	I would take the pill at night and made sure I ate something before I took it, but I would still get extremely nauseous.
25	248	I am nauseous a lot and cry for no reason.
25	249	Also a loss of appetite, I'll start eating a meal and lose interest about halfway through or get a nauseous feeling.
25	250	My breathing is all over the place now when I exercise, I feel nauseous and want to vomit most of the time and now I'm getting anxiety from all of this.
25	251	Very very nauseous but can't throw up.
25	252	It made me feel so dizzy and so irritated that I was snapping at everybody.
25	253	No longer dizzy or hormonally sad, or feeling like everything is cloudy.
25	254	My mood swings were awful and put a lot of stress on my relationship.
25	255	I had very severe mood swings and anxiety attacks.
25	256	I am very moody all of the time and and have a lot of mood swings.
25	257	I keep having mood swings.
25	258	Once life had mellowed out a bit, I was still having these terrible mood swings.
25	259	I stopped the pill about two months ago and have noticed my mood swings have stopped and I feel much better.
25	260	The first month I noticed I felt strange and high anxiety with many mood swings.
25	261	Before the prescription, I would have normal/heavy periods for 7 days and experienced a lot of premenstrual mood swings.
25	262	After the pill, my mood swings disappeared and my skin cleared up (haven't had a single pimple since I started).
25	263	I was so anxious and had the worst mood swings.
25	264	But my mood swings became so frequent and awful.
25	265	I had severe mood swings and was always fatigue.
25	266	I had very mild anxiety before going on the pill, Aviane did nothing to it but Orsythia has amplified it to the point where I've really struggled with my anxiety and mood swings.
25	267	Orsythia brought my anxiety to an all-time high, and I was experiencing awful mood swings.
25	268	My skin remains clear , my mood swings are in check plus I get a lighter period.
25	269	I never got mood swings or any other bad side effects while on it.
25	270	I didn't have mood swings or anything like that.
25	271	The worst part of orsythia has to be the mood swings and the sweating!
25	272	But the mood swings are the worst I just started feeling this and it happened while I was talking to one of my friends I just blew up on him, for no reason.
25	273	In the first 48 hours on Orsythia I having terrible mood swings and anxiety.
25	274	I had previously tried loestrin 24 Fe and Minerva and had awful side effects (mood swings, crying, etc) within the first week of taking each drug.
25	275	No more mood swings and I am totally satisfied with it.
25	276	In the last two months I've experienced a (frustrating) loss of appetite, mood swings, trouble sleeping and increased heart rate.
25	277	It made me have longer periods and mood swings.
25	278	I currently don't experience any mood changes, although between the first and second month I noticed that I was quick to get angry at smaller things much more frequently.
25	279	I switched from Lomedia 24 because I wasn't getting periods, which made me a little nervous.
25	280	I've lost weight since taking the pill again but I've been bleeding for about 2 weeks, I've been feeling very anxious and depressed almost.
25	281	I should have listened to the reviews telling those with anxiety to avoid this pill.
25	282	Since then, I’ve been depressed and I have no clue why; I have also had more anxiety in the past month than I have had in the past 3.
25	283	I read that others have had some anxiety and depression problems while on Orsythia.
25	284	Definitely does give you anxiety HIGH anxiety and depression.
25	285	I have also suffered from anxiety and depression in the last few months, something I thought was work-related, but have decided this pill is no longer worth the risk.
25	286	If you have any history with anxiety and/or depression, stay FAR away from this pill.
25	287	My anxiety is thru the roof, I have panic attacks weekly and throughout the month I would go into a depression where I would just be hating on myself and be completely sad for no reason at all.
25	288	I would have major meltdown anxiety attacks on a daily basis and would get incredibly  emotional from the slightest amount of stress.
25	289	I've been off this pill for 2 months and my anxiety is SO much better.
25	290	I had previous issues with anxiety and panic which I thought I dealt with until 2 months ago where I experienced very extreme anxiety.
25	291	At the end of the day it does its job, but if you're predisposed to anxiety, be weary.
25	292	Lately the anxiety attacks are just killing me.
25	293	I already have anxiety but this medication makes it so much worse.
25	294	I literally have at least four anxiety attacks daily.
25	295	I take my anxiety medication and it still doesn't help which usually it does.
25	296	Last night I had an anxiety attack so bad two hours after taking the pill and I couldn't even rest.
25	297	Over all I'd totally recommend this, no bad side effects and anxiety over getting pregnant is completely gone.
25	298	My anxiety has spiked, I've had multiple anxiety attacks since starting this pill (I am also on an anxiety medication and have been for a year and a half and it's helped with my anxiety levels wonderfully until I started Orsythia), I'm almost at my breaking point with it.
25	299	But, the biggest issue I have found with this medication would be the anxiety and depression.
25	300	I have an anxiety disorder and during my tom, I would have horrible anxiety attacks and depression.
25	301	If you have anxiety and anxiety attacks like I do just know that any hormonal birth control can make them more frequent.
25	302	Other than the extremely severe anxiety, the pill itself is not so bad.
25	303	I did not have anxiety before taking Orsythia, and now even though it has been almost a year since I quit (haven't taken another birth control since) I still have bouts of anxiety from time to time.
25	304	I believe my anxiety was triggered by this birth control.
25	305	A year & a half in I realized nothing was helping, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression.
25	306	There's also breast tenderness when my period starts but thats no surprise.
25	307	I have had slight breast tenderness but that has also gone away for the most part.
25	308	I know its the same main ingredient, I am not sure if the dosage changed but I did have tender breasts.
25	309	This pill lightened my period but I began to experience sore back, sore breasts, constant hunger and always felt tired.
25	310	It also made my breasts hurt for the 2 months, and made me have little to no appetite, I lost 20 pounds while taking this.
25	311	This medication made my breasts hurt for the entire two months that I was on it.
25	312	I am so bloated at times and my breasts hurt all throughout the month.
25	313	However, I did have my first yeast infection and reoccurring bacterial vaginosis while I was on it.
25	314	I have never had a yeast infection and I am 99% sure I had one and it is finally gone after a couple of weeks.
25	315	When taking orsythia, I got yeast infection every three months , does anyone have a same problem as me?
25	316	Orsythia also gave me recurrent and niggling yeast infections which was annoying.
25	317	I used to get yeast infections right before my period like clockwork, not an issue as soon as I began this one.
26	1	Extreme burning and itching throughout vaginal area, acne and horribly tender breasts.
26	2	My acne cleared up completely and if I ever did get pimples it was always around the same time in the same spot.
26	3	It's made my acne go away better then any of the creams they have out there.
26	4	I am on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for acne and for pregnancy prevention.
26	5	It worked very well the first couple months (originally went on it for acne) but then it started going down hill.
26	6	I was switched to it because my last birth control was very low dose and mainly for my acne, not pregnancy prevention.
26	7	My face exploded with acne which hasn't happened to me in years.
26	8	My concerns of starting a birth control pill were no weight gain, no changes in my libido and hoping to clear up my acne.
26	9	My acne is better, but not completely gone.
26	10	The doctor put me on the lo because I also wanted it to help with acne symptoms as well as general birth control.
26	11	I was on Lutera 28 which helped protection/regulation wise but gave me vaginal dryness during sex and HORRIBLE, PAINFUL acne.
26	12	No weight gain, acne is starting to go away and hopefully no more dryness but I won't know about that until my boyfriend comes back from being abroad ;)
26	13	This is my first time using birth control pills, and it was for 2 reasons: preventing pregnancy and reducing forehead acne that always worsened around ovulation.
26	14	My acne cleared up a bit too.
26	15	My acne cleared up pretty well!
26	16	I started this pill with the intent of settling my hormonal acne and it worked WONDERS!
26	17	But my mood hasn't changed, I haven't gained weight, and I don't have acne or nausea.
26	18	No acne, weight gain, or pregnancies.
26	19	I had acne and now it's gone.
26	20	I was beginning to get acne on Alesse and it was impacting my mood.
26	21	My GP recommended I try this BC because apparently it's good for acne.
26	22	With ortho I've had none of that nonsense, no weight gain, no additional moodiness, no loss of sex drive, and relatively good control over my acne.
26	23	I was on the mini pill just progesterone and during that time I got acne that never went away and I gained 25 pounds with bad mood swings.
26	24	The acne has gone away completely, no headaches, no severe mood swings and my hair has stopped falling out.
26	25	Still no weight gain, no crazy mood swings, no acne.... Just non stop period.
26	26	Still  not a bad pill because no weight gain, acne , and my  sex drive is still pretty much the same, maybe a tiny bit lowered, but probably because I am constantly on my period.
26	27	Less acne.
26	28	No weight gain, no acne, no hormonal mood swings.
26	29	Other than that, I have the same sex drive, I still don't PMS, my acne has gotten better and this is far more accessible than any other birth control here.
26	30	Was prescribed this pill for acne and used for over 2 months.
26	31	I've been on this pill for over a year I like it it cleared my acne I did gain weight tho kinda having a hard time losing it too and the mood swings are crazy like the first 10 white pills I'm the most emotional and when I start my period I actually feel normal but I'm will to stick to it cause my acne was just so bad and This pill cleared me up so I really don't mind the side affects.
26	32	Positive are I did not gain weight, light periods, cleared my acne and it did not make me emotional and it is forgiving if I forget to take the pill.
26	33	I was previously on alese and transferred to this pill to control my acne.
26	34	After a year I would have gave it a 9 (minor acne was the only issue).
26	35	When I first started taking ortho lo, my moderate acne cleared up!
26	36	5 years later and I am still on, never got pregnant, no acne, light periods, very moody during PMS but no cramps.
26	37	I originally got on for acne and just for general protection but I had some negative effects.
26	38	I used to have acne simplex and a not so regular period, it would be monthly but it would be way outta whack.
26	39	I decided to give this a try and to be honest my acne has vanished about 100% of it.
26	40	The good sides to this pill are that it makes my period very light with hardly any cramps and it also has cleared up my acne a bit but not completely.
26	41	My periods are regular (granted I have always had a regular period) my acne and weight have stayed the same.
26	42	I haven't gained weight, it hasn't helped my acne but it hasn't hurt it either, so that's fine with me.
26	43	Since its low estrogen I did not see increased breast size or decreased acne.
26	44	Also before taking the medication my acne was bad.
26	45	A couple of weeks in, I started to get horrible cystic acne on my chin.
26	46	Started my second pack, The same thing happened again with the cystic acne.
26	47	I had a low sex drive while I was taking it but other than that it got rid of my terrible cramps, and my acne cleared up a lot also.
26	48	I'm 16 and I took Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo because I suffer from hormonal severe acne.
26	49	I've had horrible acne since 7th grade.
26	50	On the issue of acne, while I was on the pill, after 3 months my skin was clear.
26	51	Then I was finished with my pill because it cured my acne.
26	52	Suddenly a couple months later, my acne returned again.
26	53	If you are looking to treat acne this is the pill.
26	54	I had awful acne on my jaw line - my doctor told me it was hormonally related.
26	55	However, this pill DID have pros: I didn't get pregnant, it regulated my period and caused no breakouts or acne.
26	56	Recently there was some big shortage on Necon so my pharmacy replaced it with Nortrel which gave me really bad chin acne.
26	57	I had acne all over the place.
26	58	No acne, my mood has improved, no weight gain (that I've noticed), and it works perfectly to prevent pregnancy.
26	59	It took about 2-3 months before I saw shorter lighter periods, less cramping, and fewer acne break outs.
26	60	My acne seems unchanged, but maybe it's too early to notice.
26	61	To help with bad case of PMS (acne, depression, anxiety), decided to start something that will help regulate my periods and balance my hormones.
26	62	I'm not expecting the acne to clear up immediately, but on plus side, no depression and anxiety, which is huge win.
26	63	I used this birth control for acne as well as for preventing pregnancy.
26	64	It has cleared up my acne a little, however not a lot.
26	65	No pregnancy, regulated my period and clear up my acne.
26	66	I have trouble with irregular & painful periods, acne, depression, mood swings, insomnia, etc.
26	67	I haven't changed my diet and I work out regularly, my acne has gotten worse and I'm depressed all the time, even my friends agree it's really affected my mood.
26	68	Now I have acne, which I've NEVER had a big problem with, crazy mood swings, and a low libido (not to mention vaginal dryness...) Hoping maybe a few more months will get me over this bad spell.
26	69	My skin hasn't broken out, though I am not sure this pill will help if you have acne (I took Accutane before going on this pill).
26	70	I started off by taking regular Ortho Tri Cyclen, which helped some with my acne, but I also became severely depressed, so I went off it.
26	71	After a year and a half of not taking birth control at all, I began taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for acne, and after 4 months my skin is MUCH clearer.
26	72	Genetics plays a huge role in whether you get/ have bad acne, cramping, low sex drive, etc.
26	73	As for Acne no real difference, I'm still struggling with acne but over the last year being on or off the pill hasn't made a difference.
26	74	I had a boyfriend from15 to 18 and I never got pregnant so that just shows how good it works..but on the hormonal side I took it every night at 9:00 and didn't have to deal with nausea or anything like people say they get.It kinda helped my acne and my periods were super light the first day my cramps would hurt but after I was good and it only last like 3 days.Also, it can make your digestive system whack so drink water.
26	75	I haven't had any side effects but my acne got pretty bad and my sex drive is totally down.
26	76	The only negatives I can definitely complain about is the acne and sex drive.
26	77	My acne is well contained while on the pill, but during the week "break" it flares up worse than I've ever experienced.
26	78	I took it for a week & felt bloated, got acne, headaches everyday, nausea!
26	79	My acne got worse, but I'll give it a few more months to straighten out.
26	80	My acne has gotten better and my personality hasn't changed at all thankfully, and my period was lighter and shorter.
26	81	After I noticed my Levora birth control was no longer helping my face stay clear of PMS-related acne, among other symptoms, I asked my doctor to switch me to a new birth control.
26	82	Aviane made my breasts larger but increased my acne and oily skin like crazy and made me more depressed and emotional!
26	83	I normally have clear skin, so the acne was horrible for me.
26	84	Since I've taken OTC-Lo (for 6 months), I've noticed my skin cleared up (although I still have minor acne compared to when I was off the pill), and it helped with my mood swings tremendously.
26	85	Although a bit more pricey ($15 copay), I am very happy with the improvement in mood that OTC-Lo has given me, which is a much better gain compared to the minor acne I am still experiencing.
26	86	My mild acne seem to be SLOWLY cleaning up.
26	87	I don't have acne like I used to.
26	88	I never gained a single pound, my mild acne disappeared and my periods became regular, light and short.
26	89	I have a little bit of acne around my mouth.
26	90	I did not develop acne or notice any weight gain, however.
26	91	I have moderate acne and its caused my skin to become a little red but its starting to go away now.
26	92	No acne.
26	93	I never had any weight gain, acne problems, and never had any heavy bleeding.
26	94	No mood swings, nausea, headaches, not as much acne.
26	95	Have not seen a big change in my skin but I have a specific type of acne, so check with your doctor before taking it for that.
26	96	It initially helped with acne, but I developed cystic acne while taking this pill and the pill didn't seem to help it.
26	97	The only positive was that it has gotten the cystic acne under control.
26	98	The first 5 or so years were great, I had regular periods, light-moderate bleeding, less acne and cramps but after that I've had less sex drive, regular adult acne, steady weight gain with the inability to lose easily (even tried weight-watchers with no effect), mood swings and slight depression.
26	99	As soon as I switched I got horrible acne.
26	100	In the following months my acne cleared, my period pains were less and periods were shorter.
26	101	Got back on it two months ago because of two reasons, it did keep me from getting pregnant and got rid of my acne.
26	102	I have been on Ortho Tri Cylen Lo for about 4 months and it has cleared up my acne and been completely effective as birth control.
26	103	First I used it to control acne then continued to use it for acne and birth control.
26	104	This birth control has helped tremendously in controlling my acne.
26	105	I feel this pill helped clear up my acne.
26	106	I don't know yet how effective it is for my problem (ovarian cyst) but it didn't clear up my shoulder acne.
26	107	I am not pregnant, it helps with acne a little bit and it decreases cramps.
26	108	I think the only good thing is that it cleared acne very well, my period came exactly on time and no pregnancies.
26	109	I never experienced weight gain, acne, mood swings and my period is every fourth Wednesday.
26	110	It had the added benefit of clearing up all of my acne, when previously I would get zits on my chin, forehead, and back.
26	111	No breaking out, no migraines and no cramps.
26	112	The only thing now that keeps me from giving this pill 10 out of 10 is that I went from having clear skin to breaking out and it hasn't cleared up for the past 3 months.
26	113	I've been on this birth control for almost 2 weeks now, and there have been no negative side effects: no moodiness, no pimples, no weight gain or loss etc.
26	114	As soon as I quit, my face started healing and I'm back to maybe 2 pimples a month, verses 2 new pimples a day.
26	115	If I do get pimples, they are much smaller and more shallow than before, and go away quicker.
26	116	I wasn't nauseous from it, didn't gain any weight, not much difference with my pimples, and most of all I haven't changed as an individual; no mood swings or change of personality.
26	117	My periods were 3-5 days and they were very light with little to no cramps.
26	118	The only downsides are that it's expensive, period cramps are a little more intense, and my sex drive has decreased a tiny bit.
26	119	First month on this I had awful cramps, following I was very moody and I'm normally very positive.
26	120	And not on the 9/10th  month I have been spotting for the past 3 days (I think due to missing on pill but taking it first thing in the morning and the other at my usual time) but the cramps are horrible.
26	121	I had no spotting but when I got my period cramps were a little harsh.
26	122	Also terrible cramps and now I have no cramps whatsoever.
26	123	It got lighter at day 9-14, where I never wore a tampon however bled when I peed or worked out... Today I woke up, day 15, cramps, heavier bleeding, and wearing a tampon AGAIN.
26	124	I no longer suffered from debilitating morning cramps or heavy periods.
26	125	While I was off the pill I have been having headaches, insane pms, cramps, my skin has become oily, and my boobs have decreased in size :-(.
26	126	I bled for 2 months and was so weak i couldnt go to school or do anything but lay in the bed cramps were so bad and i bled through every overnight pad daily.
26	127	Ive been on this since i was 15 now 19, but at first I didnt experience any sympmtons except the daily discharge....but in the past year my mood swings are HORRIBLE, my period cramps have gotten worse, I feel very depressed and my sex drive is at an all time low!
26	128	My cramps were still pretty severe and I kept getting like brown liquid after my period would finish.
26	129	After two months, I'm going to switch to another brand because of the pain with my cramps, this brown liquid, and it was a little expensive.
26	130	The past few weeks have been bad though because I've been getting spotting, nausea, vomiting, cramps, and mood swings.
26	131	My cramps were so bad I felt like my insides were going to fall out and I never had serious problems like this.
26	132	They just gave me bad cramps instead of reducing it.
26	133	These pills gave me less menstrual cramps, but an increase in migraines.
26	134	My cramps were so bad I would cry.
26	135	My cramps are so much better now.
26	136	I started taking this when I was 15 for irregular period & horrible cramps.
26	137	I started taking Ortho Tri Cyclin Lo when I was 16 because I had horrible, horrible cramps and heavy bleeding.
26	138	Once I went back on it my skin cleared up, my cramps were gone and my period was light and lasted about 3-4 days.
26	139	I went on this pill a while back to help regulate my period and help with severe cramps.
26	140	I had an extremely heavy flow and my cramps were so unbearable.
26	141	Since being on the pill, I usually dont get any cramps which is amazing.
26	142	I rarely ever get cramps and do not have PMS at all.
26	143	After around 10 months it seemed that my old PMS symptoms were returning with menstrual breakouts, cramps, irritability, etc.
26	144	I also got cramps before my period & salty/sweet cravings.
26	145	Side effects are just cramps and I noticed that I get drunk a lot easier and faster than normally would.
26	146	My periods never became lighter and I still had cramps.
26	147	I get a daily headache, really bad nausea followed with occasional vomiting, cramps, spotting, vaginal dryness, my sex drive has gone out the window, leg cramps in my calf, bloating, yeast infections and frequent urinary tract infections.
26	148	I normally have really terrible and painful periods but after the 3rd month my cramps became more bearable.
26	149	However, I had extremely heavy periods lasting 5-6 days until it was finished completely; painful cramps, spotting lightly at times, spotting heavily; mood swings; fatigue and recurrent yeast infections.
26	150	I was put on it for my severe cramps I get.
26	151	It DOES make my periods lighter and no cramps!
26	152	I had horrible cramps and nausea.
26	153	I do have some cramps, but its nothing extreme.
26	154	I would LOVE to have cramps instead of headaches.
26	155	I never get uncomfortable cramps so I cannot really notice the pill.
26	156	I am bloated three weeks out of every month, have terrible cramps and almost no sex drive.
26	157	It really did help with cramps, too.
26	158	My period is so much lighter than from when I was not taking it, it only lasts for about 4-5 days, and I have no cramps or bleeding between periods.
26	159	I don't have any cramps like I used to before I started taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo.
26	160	The only complaint I have is bad cramps, but they only happen in the first couple of days.
26	161	It has prevented pregnancy, helped me keep clear skin, and lightened my periods and lessen my cramps.
26	162	I have lighter periods and my cramps are not as bad.
26	163	I would recommend this pill for anyone who has a heavy flow and really bad cramps.
26	164	Good: I went from having terrible cramps to practically no cramps at all.
26	165	I had cramps a week before and a week after my period.
26	166	The length of my period remained the same but I no longer have severe cramps like I did before taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo.
26	167	My cramps are very light, and I only have mood swings for a few hours at the begining of that week.
26	168	I cramp worse but it's nothing I can't handle.
26	169	The first month wasn't that great I got my period twice and had severe cramping.
26	170	Had no cramping, bleeding, or weight gain.
26	171	My periods are slightly less heavy and I don't have the normal monthly cramping like I used to.
26	172	No more feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, crying spells, moody, irritable, fatigue, tiredness, anxiety, acheness, cramping, headaches and the worse of all symptoms lack of desire to enjoy life!
26	173	I also had cramping all month the first month and bleeding.
26	174	Since starting the pill three months ago, I have had mood swings, cramping and periods that last between 10-14 days.
26	175	It has prevented pregnancy for me, I did realize my boobs got a little bigger, my sex drive is the same as it was, no weight gain and there's bad cramping in the beginning of my cycle but then it goes away.
26	176	I have not experienced cramping or weight gain.
26	177	I started taking it to regulate my cycle, for lighter periods, less cramping and all the other positives the pill boasts (and got it!).
26	178	No spotting or anything, which was a problem I had on the NuvaRing.
26	179	The only down side to it is I have brown spotting, but it's nothing that would cause concern as I was told it was a regular side effect of being on BC.
26	180	Otherwise, no migraines, spotting, nausea, or muscle pain.
26	181	I missed a couple pills last month and had spotting for a couple weeks.
26	182	The spotting put a huge damper on my sex drive/life (not enjoyable at all).
26	183	I start bleeding midway through my third week and don't stop spotting until midway through the first week of next pack.
26	184	I was extremely moody and emotional, crying over everything and very depressed, plus I was spotting and bleeding almost constantly.
26	185	Had headaches, couldn't sleep well, very moody, was always snapping at my husband, crying at everything, had spotting and worst of all I had very low sex drive.
26	186	No nausea, no headaches, no spotting.
26	187	I have been taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for some time now and the only problem I had is during the first month of using this pill, I had "spotting".
26	188	Obviously in the beginning the first month or so was a little annoying.. getting my period still pretty heavy and if I skipped a pill more than once in a month I would spot, but I think that is normal.
26	189	The first three months were the worst because I seemed to spot daily until my third period on this pill.
26	190	Not to mention I spotted every week before my period.
26	191	After 7-8 months are when things started to chance I spotted for 11 days; and that had never happened to me.
26	192	However, I frequently spotted between periods.
26	193	This BC has given me more or a headache than anything
26	194	The second day of using this pill I got a really bad headache and vomiting occured.
26	195	The 2nd time around I felt bloated & got a headache again the first day.
26	196	I experienced a headache for 1 day, and noticed that my taste buds are weird to certain junk foods.
26	197	No side effects at all (besides mild nausea and headache for the first few days).
26	198	My face cleared up, I actually lost weight, and I did not get pregnant however one night I got a severe headache.
26	199	I also get headaches and now lower back pains.
26	200	I have been on birth control for three years and due to weight gain I changed from Depo to Ortho and it's the worse yet..my period is very heavy and the headaches and nausea are unbearable..I have come to the conclusion that I am just going to stop birth control completely.
26	201	I never really experienced many symptoms the worst would be the really bad headaches towards the end of my active pills and during the placebo pills.
26	202	Prior to that I was on Yasmine for a year which caused my hair to thin out but my doctor was concerned it was giving me really bad headaches.
26	203	From my last pill, this one decreased my severe headaches.
26	204	I did have regular periods, but headaches came back full force and I am moody always.
26	205	I have been on this birth control for quite sometime I had many side effects such as weight gain, dizziness/Lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, severe onset of migraines and headaches, moodiness.
26	206	I haven't gained weight and the only side effect is headaches.
26	207	I had frequent headaches and just felt depressed.
26	208	I am feeling the nausea and headaches.
26	209	But, the side effects for me were: I would headaches after taking the pill and sometimes randomly during the day.
26	210	The first week I had a few intense headaches, but there was also a major weather fluctuation where I live, so I can't say for sure what was the cause.
26	211	I have headaches with neurological symptoms, change in appetite, my breast were enlarged for 2 months then went down to normal size.
26	212	I haven't been nauseous, no headaches, no appetite changes, no bloating, etc.
26	213	I did experience some nausea and headaches but they went away after a few days.
26	214	I got sick and had terrible headaches and some stomach pain.
26	215	It has taken my body a bit to get used to it but I haven't experienced mood swings, nausea, or headaches.
26	216	I always have headaches.
26	217	I don't think I noticed this at first or even realized the pill was the cause, but this pill gave me terrible headaches for 3-4 days during my period.
26	218	The period is very light, which is a plus, but I can't stand the headaches.
26	219	I rarely get headaches so I read the back label and it said if you get severe headaches to contact your doctor so I did and they switched me to Ortho-Micronor which I hated.
26	220	I also had severe headaches, mood swings, no sex drive, and I was bloated.
26	221	It takes about three months to adjust to it, and taking it at night helps with the nausea and headaches you may experience.
26	222	However, in October 2009 I started experiencing dizzy spells and vision problems that have turned into full-blown migraines, headaches, and body aches.
26	223	No headaches, no nausea, no digestive system problems.
26	224	I thought it was better than all the others I've tried since it didn't give me headaches or nausea, but I'd take headaches and nausea any day over this.
26	225	As far as birth control goes it works but I have had horrible headaches, monthly pains that I never had before, horrible mood swings and weight gain and very bloated.
26	226	Every month I experience a migraine along with my period that lasts 2-3 days.
26	227	The bad part is that I got severe migraines about 2.5 weeks into the pack and I have never gotten one before.
26	228	Aside from some migraines, which I'm hoping they'll go away soon, no side effects.
26	229	I can only say negative about this - migraines, weight gain and tiredness.
26	230	I've also noticed a slight decrease in sex drive if that's what you're into.
26	231	also, it absolutely killed my sex drive which is very annoying.
26	232	Side effects: breast tenderness, increase sex drive and bloating close to menstration.
26	233	I switched from Aviane to this and  Iam extremly satisfied!With Aviane I was depressed , confused easily and even my vision would get blurry and also sex drive was completly shot.
26	234	With this medication though, I have no side effects and I am really happy :)Especially that I still have a sex drive on it..I have been on it one month.
26	235	I don't feel nauseous at all, very minimal bloating, my skin's a bit clearer, and my sex drive's the same!
26	236	Sex drive was the same if not increased.
26	237	I've lost some of my sex drive though which is a bit depressing.
26	238	I haven't gain any weight, have't had any mood swings, and my sex drive hasn't been diminished.
26	239	No weight gain, no moodiness, and my sex drive actually increased.
26	240	No weight gain, haven't gotten pregnant, plus my sex drive is through the roof now.
26	241	My sex drive completely disappeared and it caused me as well as my husband much distress and depression.
26	242	Two weeks after stopping the medication, my sex drive came back with a vengeance.
26	243	I went through two whole packs and decided to switch because of extremely low sex drive, extreme mood swings and increased appetite (I would eat a full meal and two hours later my stomach would be growling again).
26	244	I have not lost my sex drive, and if anything its been increased.
26	245	I have my sex drive still intact, but I am always hungry (I've always been this way but know it is out of control)!
26	246	This is my last month taking it as it is most likely the reason I gained so much weight, plus it took away my sex drive.
26	247	I'm also suffering from depression and I lost my sex drive as well as I can't climax.
26	248	Although, once in a while it did cause slight nausea and usually always low sex drive, as most others have agreed.
26	249	The biggest side-effect I've noticed is low, low sex drive.
26	250	Also, I've noticed an extreme loss of sex drive along with a loss of energy.
26	251	The fact that it throws your hormones off my sex drive is finally low.
26	252	My mood has improved drastically, as well as sex drive and wetness.
26	253	I also noticed a decrease in my sex drive.
26	254	My sex drive seemed to increase and to be very honest, I no longer had any use for lubricant other than what my body produced.
26	255	I have noticed a SEVERE lack of sex drive!!
26	256	As in no sex drive at all, nothing, notta, zero, zilch!!
26	257	Sex drive is low but not awful.
26	258	I never had mood swings, weight gain, or decreased sex drive.
26	259	NO sex drive, mood swings, extreme fatigue and depression.
26	260	My sex drive hasn't decreased much, my periods are light and predictable, and I haven't become pregnant.
26	261	I have lost most of my sex drive.
26	262	It has definitely lowered my sex drive.
26	263	And have a decreased sex drive.
26	264	I do have a decreased sex drive and I am emotional.
26	265	Bad: My sex drive was already very low, and now it's even lower.
26	266	I had a huge decrease in sex drive, I gained 25 lbs in weight, I cried a lot for any situation, I had mood swings and my period lasted 5 -6 days and heavy with PAIN!
26	267	(On previous Birth Controls, I experienced sore and enlarged breasts, extremely decreased sex drive, and difficulty even responding to sexual anything).
26	268	My extra 10 lbs, lowish sex drive, which this hasn't helped but hasn't made worse either.
26	269	This birth-control pill I believe increased my libido which was amazing.
26	270	My libido completely died and I had depression/mood swings while on it.
26	271	But be wary of weight gain, decreased libido and mood swings.
26	272	I've been on it for about 3 months so far and I've noticed that I grew up cup size, my skin has cleared up, and thankfully no weight gain or pregnancies.
26	273	I noticed weight gain in my stomach in the first 2 weeks to the point where my jeans wouldn't fit.
26	274	No noticeable weight gain or change in mood or anything.
26	275	No weight gain.
26	276	I was on this pill for about a year and noticed weight gain, irritability, and horrible periods.
26	277	My doctor recommend me this pill and I was worried about weight gain but I have actually felt like I've lost a little bit of weight within a month of taking it DAILY AT THE SAME TIME EVERYDAY.
26	278	No weight gain, it has cleared up my skin, prevented pregnancy, regulated and lightened my periods.
26	279	However, I didn't see an increase in weight gain and my boobs grew a tiny bit .
26	280	Got on it mainly to have normal period regulation, had a drastic increased appetite and odviously caused drastic weight gain but now decided to get off of it in hopes to lose weight.
26	281	I was so scared of potential weight gain.
26	282	But when I was on it, it really helped keep my cycle super regular, skin clear, and no weight gain.
26	283	I'm 5'5 and weigh 115-120 my weight sometimes it fluctuates 5 pounds or so but I never had any major weight gain taking this medicine.
26	284	Overall, besides the weight gain I would say that this pill has done wonders.
26	285	I got off it  6 months ago to see if the weight gain was because of the pill and sure enough it was.
26	286	It's a great product, just don't like the weight gain.
26	287	Have never experienced weight gain, and never had a pregnancy scare.
26	288	I told my doctor I thought the weight gain was due to the pills, but she insisted it wasn't.
26	289	The pill definitely can, and was, the reason for weight gain.
26	290	My skin rarely broke out, I never got pregnant or even a pregancy scare, & didn't notice any weight gain either.
26	291	Drinking more water will combat bloating, weight gain, and fatigue.
26	292	I liked it for the most part, my period was very predictable every month with minor pain-no mood swings or weight gain.
26	293	I am not comfortable with the weight gain.
26	294	My skin cleared up, I had no weight gain or other side effects.
26	295	I'm trying something else mainly due to weight gain, mood swings and cost - I'm in Arizona - OTCL is now $88 a month.
26	296	PROS: For me, this pill caused no weight gain.
26	297	I had depression with another birth control pill and switched back to this, and after a year or so I noticed the weight gain back.
26	298	It's okay though but my self esteem isn't as great due to weight gain.
26	299	over the time I took the pill i gained weight and my boobs grew a cup and 1/2, but i would not blame the weight gain on the pill.
26	300	No weight gain, no moodiness.
26	301	However, I could have done without the longer, heavier periods and the 15 lb weight gain that has taken me months to reverse (currently taking my usual birth control).
26	302	My boobs got a bit larger on it from a B cup to a D, don’t think I gained too much weight, I am very active and have always stayed around the same weight, maybe 5-10 pounds more on it.
26	303	I noticed I gained about 10lbs over the years on this pill, but I wouldn't 100% blame that on the pill, I'd say it's more to do with me not working out and stuffing my face.
26	304	I gained an unbearable amount of weight on my stomach and hips.
26	305	I am a gym junkie and eat super healthy but still gained so much weight on my hips and stomach.
26	306	I've also gained 5-10 pounds and it's harder for me to lose weight, but nothing significant.
26	307	I never gained weight from it or had mood swings, my period was always light and predictable.
26	308	I never gained any weight, and didn't notice any out of ordinary mood swings.
26	309	I have gained weight however I started at 17 and am now 22- college probably made me gain those few pounds.
26	310	I've been on the generic version of this medication for two years now and everything is great except I've gained over 40 lbs.
26	311	I stopped taking it for at least 6 months to a year and all of the side effects were gone, however, I became active again and started taking it I have been on it for more than 6 months now and have gained more weight, more headaches/migraines, more moodiness, increased dizziness and lightheadedness, it was a good way to start my periods regularly and to get them on track, but I can do without all of these side effects and being tired all the time.
26	312	Also I've gained weight and just feel fat.
26	313	However, I would say that I gained a solid 20 pounds since being on the pill and am currently trying to work it off with healthy eating and regular exercise.
26	314	I have been using this for 7 months and I have since gained 30 lbs.
26	315	I've lost all the weight I've gained, but it took some times and effort.
26	316	I've been taking this birth control for three months now and I've gained 15lbs.
26	317	I took Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for a year and gained 15 lbs on my 5'1 normally 105 frame.
26	318	I have not gained any weight.
26	319	I gained weight and in the beginning I had major mood swings.
26	320	But I have not gained weight.
26	321	I've gained weight while on the pill, my breasts got bigger but I was petite to begin with.
26	322	I have been taking Ortho Tricyclen lo for 2 months now and have gained about 15 pounds.
26	323	I still experience irratibility and nausea daily and have gained 5 lbs.
26	324	I've gained some weight, but not much, and have had very predictable, short periods (3.5 days).
26	325	I feel I retain water and it shows I gained 10lbs.
26	326	Have not gained much weight.
26	327	I have gained 15 pounds while on the pill, which is very disappointing because my diet is better now than it was before and I've always been very active and attend the gym.
26	328	It's very effective at clearing my skin and keeping me not pregnant, but I have gained fifteen pounds, my periods are a little longer but on time.
26	329	I get upset and cry over something little, gained about 4 pounds, boobs did get bigger though and I haven't become pregnant, so that's a plus.
26	330	I started it on the first day of my period and experienced nausea for about the first week, gradually getting better as time went on.
26	331	No nausea.
26	332	I have found many side affects to this pill such as weigh gain, breast enlargement and severe nausea.
26	333	The nausea is my main problem as I hate feeling like that and throwing up in general so I am sceptical to keep on this pill.
26	334	The first few months I had horrible nausea.
26	335	Once my body got used to being on the pill the nausea stopped.
26	336	Throughout the duration, I got more moody and felt more depressed the week before and 2 days into my period,  I get excess yeast exactly one week after my period on the first week of my pill, and lately I've been experiencing nausea, its manageable just very irritating.
26	337	The first week I took it, I would take the pill at night and then wake up in the morning with vomiting or nausea.
26	338	No mood swings, nausea, depression or changes in appetite.
26	339	Unfortunately the following morning I feel intense nausea.
26	340	And prescription nausea meds don't help.
26	341	So far, if the nausea leaves within next couple months, I will continue this medication.
26	342	I can't function with this nausea & moodiness.
26	343	I do not get any mood swings or nausea.
26	344	I started Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo on May 19th but I got my period on May 3 and since I started the pill I missed my June period and I've been experiencing heartburn, nausea, weakness/fatigue sometimes bloating.
26	345	Take it at night with a snack to fend off the nausea.
26	346	I have also had nausea, mood swings, bloating and trouble losing weight.
26	347	Now in week five I am having terrible low back pains, slight nausea and I'm a bit emotional at night...not sure if I should wait for the hormones to balance out in the next couple of months or talk to the doctor about other options?
26	348	I only took it for two days and I began to experience severe side effects including: insomnia, extreme depression, anxiety, nausea, irritability and light abdominal pain.
26	349	I passed out a lot from nausea and dizziness.
26	350	At the beginning of every cycle (the first couple white pills) I would wake up in the middle of the night with nausea.
26	351	The first 3 months were pretty bad, experienced nausea and stomach pains.
26	352	I must admit that things did start off a little rocky with the nausea, but it did begin to get better because I started taking the pill before bed.
26	353	Besides the nausea the pill is very effective and a good choice.
26	354	When I first started I experienced nausea and vomiting but it went away after a week.
26	355	In my 5th year, however, I had MONO (my doctors think, it was never actually diagnosed) which made my liver function decrease and after months of nausea, fatigue, abdominal pain, CT scans, endoscopies, etc.
26	356	Side note, the first week i took this i was throwing up every night and feeling nauseated but if you stick with it those side effects eventually subside.
26	357	The first month I felt only mildly nauseated.
26	358	As long as I ate right before or after taking the pill I would not get nauseated.
26	359	I was a little nauseous the first few days of the birth control but that settled itself.
26	360	As long as I ate with the pill during the first week, I never felt nauseous.
26	361	When I first started taking it I did feel nauseous the first two weeks but after that my body adjusted and I was fine.
26	362	During the first couple years on birth control my period were much better and predictable but I would feel nauseous when I started taking my pill again after my period.
26	363	The first month was aggravating was very nauseous had a lot of extra bleeding, but now my body is use to it and I feel no side effects I take it at night before bed on a full stomach.
26	364	I feel nauseous all the dang time.
26	365	But being nauseous all the time is terrible.
26	366	This pill makes me nauseous, my breasts are always tender and if I'm not crying, I'm in a screaming fit of rage (my poor husband).
26	367	I was only a tad nauseous on the first day but I found my mood was overall happier and I have a great amount of energy.
26	368	I haven't ever been nauseous or sick at all, but I do take it at 7pm.
26	369	I've tried Diane before and I was nauseous every morning and I had to stop it before I could even finish a week.
26	370	The first couple of months I felt nauseous and lightheaded.
26	371	The side effects were mild; a nauseous feeling when I first woke up, and constant vaginal dryness.
26	372	Of course with any birth control you feel slightly dizzy and tired when you first start taking it , But after a few weeks that wears off and my body adjusted.
26	373	I can't tell if I have mood swings because I've always been so moody.
26	374	Mood swings, crying, psycho basically.
26	375	Also the mood swings are terrible as well.
26	376	i tried it for two months and since day 1 I  suffered from major mood swings and low energy.
26	377	Since starting this pill, I've had a three week cycle, major breakouts, mood swings, and lack of appetite.
26	378	Long story short, I had been on Necon for 8 years with no problems (clear skin, regular period, no mood swings).
26	379	(I go through 2 tampons every 8 hours as opposed to 2 every 1 hour) I haven't noticed any mood swings and my insomnia has definitely improved.
26	380	I suffer from terrible mood swings and irregular periods.
26	381	I had absolutely no mood swings until about two months ago.
26	382	I dont have mood swings at all I am very calm at all times.
26	383	For the first 2 weeks I experienced terrible mood swings and was extremely sensitive.
26	384	No side effects besides the fact that after a year of taking it nonstop, I started to have major mood swings.
26	385	The reason why I stopped taking this pill was because I had overwhelming mood swings and depression.
26	386	I have also experienced mood swings.
26	387	The first couple of months I had several bad mood swings, but those have improved.
26	388	I also have not had problems with mood swings.
26	389	I'm thinking about getting off of it because of my mood swings.
26	390	At worst I would say it had no effect on my mood swings but at least it did not make them worse.
26	391	I do have some mood swings but it's not at an unbearable level and for the most part they are average low, rather than an insane depression.
26	392	Have experienced racing heart, panic attacks constant mood swings.
26	393	No mood changes or negative effects .
26	394	The last couple weeks, it has made me super depressed and have major mood changes which is why I am coming off this BC.
26	395	Pros:  No mood changes, felt great, did not get pregnant, very light periods.
26	396	There are no mood changes, I have lost a little bit of weight and it has even helped with my Rosacea.
26	397	At first I was nervous that it wouldn't be the exact same but I looked up the ingredients and they're the exact same and same levels as the name brand.
26	398	I'm nervous about the tri-phasic style of the pill as I'm very sensitive to hormone shifts, so I may update my review after a months.
26	399	I had never been on birth control before so I was super nervous when I got married to start taking it.
26	400	I'm a beginner, I'm still nervous about this though.
26	401	After reading horror stories about birth control online, I was very nervous to start taking the pill.
26	402	I am going to try the Nuvaring next, which I am very nervous about because I'm not sure how it will affect me.
26	403	By the end of the second month however I felt anxious and irritable.
26	404	I felt anxious and worried all the time and it made me feel crazy.
26	405	This pill makes me feel crazy, have racing anxious thoughts, worrying about lots of things including death, like crying or punching someone in the face, and very tired.
26	406	I was moody and anxious for the first 2 months but I feel like I am adjusting to the hormones!
26	407	Taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo made me moody, depressed and anxious.
26	408	The first week of the first pack really amped up my depression and anxiety but by the second week it subsided and haven't had any issues since.
26	409	The first month was perfect but by the second month I became extremely depressed and had terrible anxiety, to the point where I could no longer leave my house.
26	410	I dont have vaginal dryness, yeast infections, UTI's, or anything else that people are saying besides breast tenderness.
26	411	I do get yeast infections more often than I ever have before though and I did get breast tenderness from time to time.
26	412	The only continuous side effect is breast tenderness.
26	413	I was extremely moody and tired all the time and to top it off I got the yeast infection from hell.
26	414	I also get more yeast infections when I never had them before.
27	1	I've never had acne, and I still don't.
27	2	It keeps my weight regulated, periods, helps my acne stay bare minimum or none at all.
27	3	My doctor prescribed this for me initially for my acne and to regulate my period.
27	4	My acne cleared up, I lost a couple pounds, my sex drive has increased, my cycle has been very regular and no more nausea.
27	5	I've stuck with it for two years but I can't handle the long periods, acne, hairy chest, and major weight gain.
27	6	What happened with me is Tri-Cyclen gave me acne (never had a problem with acne before) and depression and anxiety.
27	7	Cleared up my acne, no mood swings, no weight gain, and light periods that happened like clock work!
27	8	I had no acne, mood swings, or break through bleeding.
27	9	I have been taking this birthcontrol since I was 15 (I am now 20), had terrible, terrible acne, bad periods and vicious mood swings prior to the medication.
27	10	After I started taking it my acne disappeared with in 3 days, my periods were so much better.
27	11	I notice if I stop taking it I gain a crazy amount of weight and my acne instantly comes back.
27	12	I started this contraceptive at 16 to control my acne and it did a great job.
27	13	I'm very active and eat very healthy, also my acne has come back in full affect.
27	14	I did not experience any weight gain, acne or physical side effects, and the birth control did do its job (prevent pregnancy).
27	15	Breakthrough bleeding, two periods in one month, weight gain, horrible lower back pain and cramping and terrible acne!
27	16	I have never had issues with weight gain (unless I am hogging into a box of cookies), no acne, mood swings, and no pregnancy scares.
27	17	I got on this bc to clear up my acne and it may be to soon to tell how it really works, but based on the side effects I'm already experiencing I do not think I will continue suffering.
27	18	My acne has been getting a bit worse but I hear it gets better after 3 months?
27	19	I haven't had any mood swings out of the regular and my acne is nonexistent.
27	20	I've been on Ortho Tri-Cyclen for about 3/4 months now and the biggest positive for me was that it cleared my hormonal chin acne.
27	21	It's has always helped with my acne.
27	22	My acne and oily skin came back, and I am very irritable(PMS).
27	23	I've been on this pill for 6 months, I have lost my sex drive, my cramps are worse then normal, my period last a full week, and I have worse acne then normal.
27	24	Definitely glad I switched over - no random mood swings, cleared all acne within a month, no weight gain, over all it the best birth control I've been on
27	25	It regulated my period and cleared my acne and I don't remember having any side effects then.
27	26	This is the one for me, it cleared up my acne within a month of taking it, I've had no weight gain or weight loss, no headaches.
27	27	Cramps, well sometimes but not bad, no problems with acne, no mood swings (unless I'm ON my period, but that's a given).
27	28	I took it for a while mainly for acne and I wanted the IED but my OB suggested I try this as a birth control method as well as help with my acne after I had my first child.
27	29	I must admit it did wonders on my periods and acne.
27	30	I had no spotting, weight gain or acne on this pill but it did not help me with PMS.
27	31	I've been on different pills for the past 7 years due to extreme period cramps and acne as well but I've been on this Ortho TriCyclen for 2 years and I just want to say that Birth control does NOT affect your weight.
27	32	My acne has cleared up dramatically and my cramps are gone and my period lasts between 4-5 days.
27	33	It also did wonders for acne!
27	34	This is the ONLY pill I have tried that does not make me bleed through half the pack, clears up my acne to an extent, does not affect my mood, and makes my cramps basically nonexistent.
27	35	I never really got acne, so that stayed about the same, I'm about the same emotionally, except for maybe worse PMS symptoms.
27	36	The plus side to this pill though was my acne cleared up and I didn't gain any weight.
27	37	After taking it for about 6 months I had severe chest pain, a headache almost everyday, almost zero sex drive and the worst acne I have ever had in my life.
27	38	It helped decrease my acne, my period went from 5-6 days to 3-4 day, my period was also very light (almost no heavy days), and I almost never had cramps.
27	39	After the first week I started getting a few deep cystic pimples, one along my jaw and another on my chin.
27	40	I was on this pill for two months and although I did not have spotting, I noticed that it caused major mood swings, depression, weight gain (10 pounds), tenderness in breast, and my skin has changed (occasional pimple and normal skin, I started to have red bumps, pimples and oily).
27	41	Pros: high sex drive, regular bleeding, little to no cramps, affordable.
27	42	Long periods and cramps.
27	43	I typically don't have very severe cramps, so I can't comment on that.
27	44	My periods are shorter and my cramps less severe.
27	45	I was always irregular and had very bad mood swings, cramps, headaches, and nausea associated with PMS and my period.
27	46	Yes it has allowed me to be more regular in my cycle and my cramps are lessened+flow is lighter, which is what I originally had asked for from my first bc and what I received and why I gave a 6/10.
27	47	The worst part was my first menstrual cycle, it was excruciating strong cramps like someone stabbed me, radiating to my legs and stomach.
27	48	I was on alesse for the last 2.5 years - my cramps calmed down quite a bit but I was still spotting (but without BC I would have 7 day periods and terrible cramps, I also have fibroids).
27	49	Within the first week of taking the pill, I got my period, and I got the worst cramps ever - more worse than before i was using any contraceptive; tingling/numbness in legs, severe cramps, nausea.
27	50	No cramps.
27	51	Normal cramps and a shorter period (4-5 days).
27	52	First time on birth control and I started with this one mainly because I had terrible cramps and period side effects.
27	53	Hardly ever had any cramps as well.
27	54	Very light periods, no cramping.
27	55	But I also experienced mild cramping like if I'm getting my period and headaches, nausea and no appetite.
27	56	My lower back hurts often from cramping....My breasts are tender and feel hard and I am feeling a lot more emotional (I cry a lot now) I feel fatigued all of the time and I don't know if it's from this medication or stress.
27	57	I also missed a weeks worth of the pill due to not picking it from the pharmacy so I waited till my next period to restart it and now I'm nauseated and cramping super bad, this is the second day back on it and my period ended just last week.
27	58	The cramping was awful though.
27	59	Still have pretty bad cramping though.
27	60	Periods were kind of heavy with cramping but manageable.
27	61	During the use of the birth control, I had mild spotting in between periods as well as some cramping.
27	62	However, it does cause me to spot the week before my period most months and not all cramping is gone.
27	63	I had horrible cramping, nausea, weird sleeping patterns.
27	64	Some cramping here and there before my period but I always get my period the third day of my iron pills.
27	65	It has worked great for preventing pregnancy and has made my periods lighter with less cramping.
27	66	At first I was experiencing some abdominal cramping, but that went away after a while.
27	67	I want sex more now but I guess you can say I experience a little cramping sharp pains every now and then.
27	68	I have tried several generic forms as well as the Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo and experienced mild unwanted side effects such as cramping and spotting.
27	69	I had an IUD for years too, but didn't like the spotting always at the wrong time.
27	70	My doctor suggested that I change pills since I should have stopped spotting and put me on tricyclean.
27	71	Have had spotting for 2 months.
27	72	But the thing that made my Doctor switch me to Apri was that I had spotting  everyday for 15 days before my period for the last 4 months of taking it.
27	73	MAJOR hair loss, anxiety, insomnia, weight gain, panic attacks AND large dark spot on forehead (melasma)
27	74	I was very gassy, moody, my boobs were so tender (still kinda are) and I spotted for a week then a heavy painful period for another week.
27	75	I constantly had a headache caused from the estrogen levels so they switched me to something not so high.
27	76	Terrible headaches.
27	77	The first week was fine then after that I started getting headaches then comes the nausea in the morning and then I throw up non stop with all that I get diarrhea and dizzyness, lack of energy and appetite I stayed in bed all day today its horrible the worst I ever took
27	78	I sometimes get headaches during the placebo pill days but those are easily combated by advil.
27	79	I have no motavation to get up in the morning and I'm always tired no matter how many hours I sleep, I have headaches like nobody's business.
27	80	I thought the depo shot was bad, but I am already experiencing depression, nausea, headaches, and insomnia.
27	81	I stay home from school every time I'm on it because I can't handle them and I get horrible headaches while I'm on my period.
27	82	This birth control had given me side effects from the start, moodiness, weight gain( ten pounds), headaches, nausea, it did clear my skin which is what I went on it for however 8 months into taking it I was admitted into the hospital with bi lateral blood clots in my lungs.
27	83	I do get headaches, but they do not interfere with my daily activites so I don't mind.
27	84	I  just started this birth control (first bc ever tried), the first 3 days when i was on this bc i got the worst headaches.
27	85	But now i don't feel depressed anymore and I don't get terrible headaches.
27	86	I would also get terrible migraines and I NEVER get migraines or headaches.
27	87	I get constant headaches, my mood swings are off the wall (affecting my boyfriend and i's relationship), nausea, difficulty concentrating, irrational thoughts and depression.
27	88	I rarely suffer from headaches and this pill made me get one almost every other day, which was annoying and uncomfy.
27	89	The side effects I have had are: I lost a couple of pounds since starting it, my breasts are pretty sensitive, and I will get occasional headaches.
27	90	Rated 9 on account of the mood swings and headaches.
27	91	The only thing I have to say as a con is migraines.
27	92	In addition, I've had a a much larger appetite since starting and have gained 20 pounds since I began taking it, and I've had a lot more migraines and dizzy spells (I'm a mess).
27	93	Crying for no reason, migraines and temporary blindness!
27	94	Didn't trigger my regular migraines, great birth control to start on and it's effective!
27	95	I tried bcp in college, but they aggravated my migraines.
27	96	At age 23, my neurologist said that because most of my migraines occurred just before my period, OrthoTricylen would work for me.
27	97	My migraines got BETTER, my already clear complexion become clearer, and my periods lightened.
27	98	If you have migraines, talk to your neurologist about this pill.
27	99	I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen for 8 months then I switched to the generic brand (Tri-Nessa) for 2 months and started to get migraines.
27	100	It definitely effects sex drive because the month I was off it was high and then went low again after.
27	101	Sex drive is also a little blah.
27	102	Unfortunately I gained 26 pounds (I was 100lb when I first started, but not complaining) I had major mood swings, I cried at anything and everything, it gave me depression, I had irrational thoughts (totally not the kind of person I am) and also recurring yeast infections along with a very LOW sex drive.
27	103	However, I am also dealing with the random spurts of depression and lack of sex drive.
27	104	I took this for 3 yrs and 6 months everything has been great for me, no gain weigth, no loss of appettite, basically the same on weight, but the only thing that changed was my sex drive, I dont feel the same its low sex drive, very dry down there.
27	105	Also, I had no sex drive at all.
27	106	It made me very hungry all the time and my sex drive went shooting up.
27	107	This pill caused me to be nauseous, have acid reflux and zapped my sex drive.
27	108	I had lighter and shorter periods but my sex drive went DOWN.
27	109	I know it will pass as I take it as I said above I had a great first experience besides having no sex drive.
27	110	I always use condoms but gave it an 8 due to loss in sex drive but other than that, it's great pill!
27	111	My sex drive went up.
27	112	Month one I started noticing a decline in my sex drive.
27	113	My biggest problem with this pill is my absolute lack in sex drive.
27	114	My sex drive is outrageous, maybe even a little more than when I started on the pill...I'm just worried about the amount of weight gained in such a short time..I am also really bad at remembering to take the pill every day.
27	115	I think this is a great pill, it worked wonders for my sex drive as well.
27	116	I never had any emotional problems or problems with sex drive that some users report.
27	117	Other than weight gain, I haven't had any major issues but I will be switching pills due to weight gain.
27	118	Like 20 pound weight gain.
27	119	I have had weight gain but that's more due to my lack of exercise and being in college.
27	120	Weight gain which I'm not sure but I don't think birth control took a big toll on it.
27	121	Being that I'm in college and in love I think I had to be a blame for my own weight gain lol.
27	122	On this birth control for 1 year i had notice increase in appetite.Breast size increase from a Small B been like that forever to a full C.Weight increased to 145lb In 1 year.Skin was slightly clearer but has occasional breakout on chin meaning hormonal imbalance.Asked my NP to switch me to a lower hormone BCP because of weight gain she says it's might be my diet that has to change but I insisted.
27	123	About 4 pounds of weight gain which is no problem.
27	124	I finally went to my doctor with the following symptoms: tired all the time even with 10 hours of sleep, mood swing (which effect my relationship), depression, sadness (for no reason), crying out of no where, weight gain and inability to loose weight, bad skin.
27	125	These are low dose so weight gain is NOT a symptom!!!
27	126	Periods were lighter, no mood swings, no weight gain.
27	127	Once I got back on it, I had intense mood swings for no reason and tremendous weight gain that keeps continuing.
27	128	No weight gain yet, normal moods, I haven't missed a pill yet.
27	129	Though I am petite, it's not a huge weight gain nor is it noticeable.
27	130	Cons:  Experienced a significant increase in appetite, which led to lots of weight gain (I went from 115 lbs to 125 lbs after 6 months of use).
27	131	My main concern was weight gain by starting b/c...
27	132	I did not experience weight gain (but I'm pretty physically active 5'3 120lbs).
27	133	I Also had weight gain.
27	134	Both times, I experienced an increase in cup size (~2 cups), which was nice, but I think part of that is connected to weight gain.
27	135	No weight gain and kept my skin nice.
27	136	Within the first three months of Ortho Tri Cyclen, I didn't notice any significant changes, however, over the last six months I gained 9 pounds.
27	137	Maybe gained 10 pounds most but with exercise it helps.
27	138	I previously lost almost 40 lbs before starting this birth control and have gained 20 lbs since i starting taking Trycyclen.
27	139	Tried it for 6 months convinent but gained more weight up to 151lb.
27	140	At first I gained weight and my breasts went up a size which was great but now I'm back to loosing a lot of weight.
27	141	My husband and I have been dieting and exercising for the past year and half and I have only gained weight, never lost.
27	142	The first 3 months of taking the pill were rough, I was always tired, gained a little weight, and had mood swings.
27	143	I gained 30 pounds in 6 months since getting back on the pill.
27	144	I also gained 10 lbs while on the pill
27	145	I've been taking orthocyclen for about 2-3 years now, and I pretty much gained like 20 pounds.
27	146	I gained about 10 pounds the first time I took it.
27	147	And I decided to get off of it for awhile, then I went back on it and gained 10 more pounds.
27	148	Now that I have been taking it for two months, I have definitely not felt like myself and have been depressed & unable to concentrate, and have gained 7 lbs.
27	149	My face is clearer, my hormones are in check, my boobs are bigger but I haven't gained weight anywhere else, and I'm not pregnant!
27	150	I have gained 27 lbs on my 5 foot frame.
27	151	It made me bloated, very moody, depressed, and gained 17 pounds and kept on gaining until switched to a different pill.
27	152	My boobs feel like they've gained 20 pounds and are always hurting.
27	153	I've been taking this pill for about 6 months now, and have gained 20 pounds.
27	154	I gained about 8-10 pounds, which is almost 10% of my body weight so it made a noticeable difference.
27	155	Oh and I gained 30 lbs in the first 4 months.
27	156	During the first month I gained 5 lbs, but that was it.
27	157	I've used this pill for a month and I've gained 10 pounds in just one month, and I became very moody.
27	158	I been taking this pill for almost two years and gained 13 pounds.
27	159	I gained 15 lbs over the course of taking the pill, but that is probably due to getting older (16y-24y).
27	160	I gained 5lbs and didn't sleep well.
27	161	When I first started it I had terrible nausea and dizziness.
27	162	I recommend taking it daily with food because no food in your system can cause nausea.
27	163	The first week gave me really terrible nausea, so it was difficult to eat during the first few days.
27	164	However, about a month into taking this, I started experiencing extreme nausea and about weekly vomiting.
27	165	The first couple of months, I experienced occasional nausea and dizziness but that's to be expected when starting a new hormonal treatment.
27	166	But starting off I experienced mild nausea and mood swings.
27	167	I'm starting it again after a year break and I immediately noticed this awful nausea even though I take it at night I'll still wake up sick.
27	168	I've only been on it for a couple of days so as I get used to the medicine the nausea will (hopefully) go away.
27	169	In the mornings if I don't eat at a certain time I do get nauseated and throw up but my cycle has always been on time and consistent.
27	170	The only problem the first week I used it I've been nauseated.
27	171	First week seriously nauseous... dizzy.
27	172	I also became so nauseous and sick because of it that I had to take time out.
27	173	It got to the point where i'd end up dizzy & hyperventilating.
27	174	No mood swings, no PMS, no depression, I feel the same every day.
27	175	My mood swings and depression may have gotten worse but it was due to other mental illness stuff.
27	176	I experienced mood swings and anxiety due to this prescription ... would not recommend.
27	177	I've been taking this BC pill for about two years now, I've never experienced depression ,aniexty or mood swings.
27	178	Mood swings.
27	179	The mood swings are terrible.
27	180	I was getting harsh pains in my arms and legs daily, Id get stabbing chest pains and sometimes weird feelings and sometimes stabbing, excruciating pains in my uterus.. Not to mention the intense mood swings and random crying and anger all the time.. My head always felt like it had pressure in it, or like someone was stabbing my brain with an ice pick.
27	181	Yes mood swings have increased but I was always emotional and thought of myself as someone with depression lol so you guys really have to be careful about what is really considered to be called depression.
27	182	Still rating a 10 because it does its job and other than mood swings I have no complaints
27	183	Lately I've really felt the mood swings though, I'm usually a very happy person but lately I've been feeling very blah and I feel like I can't concentrate.
27	184	The fist time I ever took this medicine I was 19 and ended up on anti-depressants because I didn't realize it was the birth control pill causing my mood swings and depression.
27	185	My mood swings changed to the point where some months I would be really depressed and down.
27	186	I started this pill and immediately had horrible mood swings.
27	187	Makes me feel depressed and anxious.
27	188	I'm a happy person and never had depression or anxiety in all my life until I got on this BC.
27	189	I started getting sad, then the sadness started to feel like depression... almost debilitating... then anxiety started to kick in.
27	190	Also, my anxiety increased, my breasts became severely sore and I started to sweat a lot more.
27	191	I also had lots of breast pain and tenderness.
27	192	I had gotten diagnosed with PCOS haven't gotten a period in 6 months so, she thought that this can help regulate my cycle so, my provider decided to prescribe this BC to me and after taking it for a week and a half I have experienced breast tenderness, sore nipples and my breasts did grow a cup size.
27	193	So far thank God no pregnancies, although increased amount of discharge and I got a vaginal infection which I never had before and that was strange.
27	194	ONLY issue was the first 3 months I kept experiencing a few yeast infections...
28	1	Having bad experiences with hormones in pills causing mood swings and acne I wanted to try the non hormone Paragard and I was SO scared of insertion I read horror and good stories on it and almost backed out but I didn’t... A hour and a half before I took two midol and listened to music with one headphone out so I could hear the doctor and braced for the worst and it wasn’t painful at all more like annoying!
28	2	& then after about 2 months of this my face began to break out with very painful cystic acne everywhere.
28	3	(I've never had a problem with acne my whole entire life).
28	4	The ONLY negative thing about getting off the pill and onto the paragard for me was I've had a little bit of acne since I'm not on hormones anymore.
28	5	I broke out with bad cystic acne all over my face.
28	6	I also experienced: painful cramping, spotting between cycles, weight gain, acne (not usual for me), and horrible bloating.
28	7	Lots of acne, dry skin, swollen lymph node, anxiety, depression, trouble sleeping, hopelessness.
28	8	My acne started healing within a few days.
28	9	I had low sex drive and acne a month after having it inserted.
28	10	I have also developed cystic acne which responds to NOTHING, hair loss and mood disorders.
28	11	They always had some kind of bad side effect on me from weight gain to acne to migraines.
28	12	I have recently gotten paragard on 9/27/16 and so far I've had light spotting and cramping did hurt when getting it inserted considering it was the second one directly behind the first one due to the first one not being placed high enough I've also never had kids I had the skyla iud for about 7 months and did not do well with it due to cramping and terrible acne hoping better luck with this due to no hormones can't speak on effectiveness yet since I've only had it 7 days also haven't had my first cycle with it yet or anything in terms of that will update again a little later
28	13	Cons include: acne, anxiety, low sex drive, fatigue, weight gain (4 pounds in one week).
28	14	The POP was effective yes, but I had crazy mood swings, acne, low sex drive, & gave me vaginal dryness, which made sex extremely painful.
28	15	It didint hurt getting it in or the removal I loved it I did cramp when I excersied and sex was sometimes pain full certain positions and the only real annoying thins was the discharge out of no where but and a big but it was great no weaight gain No acne nothing no mood swings but I started having cyst in my ovaries and the iud wasint the cause but it wasint helping either so I had it removed but had I not had a cyst I would still have it
28	16	Positives: convenience, no weight gain, acne, hair loss or anything like that.
28	17	I started the birthcontrol pill in my late teens and had horrible side effects, weight gain, acne etc etc... you name it I experienced it.
28	18	My experience with Paragard was horrible I had heavy periods, outrageous cramps, acne, mental issues due to the implant because now that I've had it removed I feel excellent.
28	19	I was ALWAYS moody, hungry, breaking out, and my libido was in the negatives.
28	20	I now have a normal cycle (26 days) 5 days of normal bleeding, no ovary pains, minor cramps, very little back and leg pain, no headaches, no major mood swings.
28	21	To not make this story longer than what it is I pretty much started to bleed  heavy for 15 days which was apparently normal according to the nurses and now it has completely stopped along with the cramps.
28	22	With every period, the cramps and bleeding seem to get more tolerable.
28	23	Besides the blood, my cramps were extremely intense, it felt like I was getting knifed in the stomach and I couldn't stand up straight.
28	24	Some of the cons are heavier period with more cramps, but I've always had a 7 day  and painful periods so I did not notice a change.
28	25	I remember the insertion being painful, like the worst cramps I’d ever felt, but brief, and then I was crampy for a few days.
28	26	My first 4-5 periods on it were pretty gnarly, though, with really heavy bleeding and horrible cramps; I had to miss school/work even with ibuprofen.
28	27	Pre-IUD, my natural period was light with rare cramps.
28	28	I love that it is non hormonal, which is why I’ve kept it in for 4.5 years, but I’m getting really sick of the heavy 6-7 day period with heavy cramps and backache every single month.
28	29	IUD insertion pain lasted for about 2 minutes, and after they took out the long metal tools used to pry open the cervix, I felt kind of nauseous and like I had major period cramps.
28	30	I bleed like I've never in my life before, cramps were so bad I had to call out of work a few times and only laying in the bed with a heating pad helped them.
28	31	I had my paraguard in for the full 10 years with little to no issues.. menstrual cramps were slightly more intense but periods were pretty short.
28	32	The cramps are horrendous and my sex drive is nearly non existent...
28	33	It has caused extreme fatigue I am 28 yrs old and have felt my body slowly breaking down first it started with heavy bleeding and cramps then I started cramping everyday I have period cramp ands constant bloating.
28	34	I had moderate cramps for two days and that's it, and it didn't make my period heavier AT ALL.
28	35	I also experienced bad menstrual cramps the first 3 periods after insertion, my flow was heavier at first but mellowed out with time.
28	36	4-5 days, no cramps and done!
28	37	Severe stomach cramps which felt like labour pains hair loss, severe depression which lead me to self harm and over dose.
28	38	After having the paraguard removed it's taken over 6 months to get where I am now which is am in more control with my moods the bleeding is back to light no more cramps and my hair is now back to long and thick.
28	39	I bleed through a super tampon and a pad in less than one hour and have excruciating cramps on and off of my period.
28	40	I have never had painful cramping or heavy periods, and the insertion cramps felt like they could have been real contractions.
28	41	I have light periods and never have cramps with my period.
28	42	Upon insertion my cramps were excruciating for about a week, then became sporadic for about a month.
28	43	I would feel contractions closer to my period (in addition to cramps).
28	44	The cramps I have had after insertion have come and gone.
28	45	Spotting regularly, terrible cramps, repetitive infections.
28	46	The cramps all throughout the month alone is enough for me.
28	47	I've also experienced EXTREMELY painful cramps throughout 3 years (& I have a high pain tolerance) & the cramps did NOT "just last a couple weeks after getting it inserted"—it happened for years.
28	48	I had very bad periods, and cramps, when I got it taken out (mid June) I got my period in July and it was horrible.
28	49	The cramps after getting it were similar to labor.
28	50	Before IUD, never had cramps.
28	51	Prior to the ParaGard, I had no cramps and light periods (~4 days).
28	52	I'm comfortable for 1 week out of every month, then the cramps start about a week before my period.
28	53	The first 2 were the absolute worst, it got a little better with time but I started feeling like a teenager again, with cramps, bleeding like crazy and for days on...
28	54	In that time, I felt like I was always about to have a period, I never had cramps before.
28	55	Excruciating cramps that take my breathe away.
28	56	Went on about my day as usual...around 8 hours later I did feel slight menstrual cramps for about 5 minutes lol but that was the worst of it.
28	57	Just uncomfortable... After the insertion the cramps were painful, but everyone is different.. Don't go by reviews, whether to get it or not.
28	58	Yes the pain was really bad with sharp sharp cramps at first I went to the ER twice and called my doctor they told me to take motrin around the clock for the next five days and now almost 9 years later it's fine.
28	59	When the doctors told me my period cramps would get worse I thought nothing of it.
28	60	The first week after it was installed I had debilitating cramps for three days straight and constant bleeding.
28	61	My doctor numbed my uterus beforehand, the insertion was a few deep strong cramps and feeling like being prodded, but nothing too crazy.
28	62	The first few hours I was having some sharp cramps, after the numbing wore off I almost went to the ER, it felt like I was having contractions and giving birth.
28	63	The cramps are non-existent now when I don't have my period.
28	64	I have cramps and bleeding but I really hope it's worth it.
28	65	However about 7th year my cramps on my left side lower body were getting bad week prior to the menstrual cycle, pain level an 8.
28	66	I have paragard inserted last week I feel light pain while inserting light cramps overall good .
28	67	The cramps afterwards are like medium-heavy period cramps.
28	68	I'd get horrible stabbing pain (different from cramps) and I would spot bleed constantly.
28	69	I get cramps that feel like contractions that make me almost fall to my knees or faint.
28	70	I get cramps THROUGHOUT the month even when I'm not on my period and sharp shooting pains on my left side when I try to sleep.
28	71	I had cramps for a few days and super heavy periods for about a year and spotting in between periods for 3 years.
28	72	I bled like I was hemorrhaging during my 10-12 day periods with cramps so bad I could barely get out of bed to take care of my children.
28	73	It is now May 2017 and for the past two weeks I have been nauseous, had cramps and been spotting.
28	74	I would describe the pain as a couple deep strong cramps, but nothing horrible.
28	75	I had cramps right away that were pretty bad but nothing too crazy for the first few hours.
28	76	The pain subsided 3 days later, although I still have some cramps here and there when I exert myself too much, it's been good.
28	77	The cramps hurt at first but nothing ibuprofen can't take care of.
28	78	The only negatives I've encountered because of it is very intense cramps during the first four days of my period and occasional spotting while I'm not on my period, both of which I've never had to deal with before getting it inserted.
28	79	The following week was hell with non stop cramps and bleeding.
28	80	7-8 days with 3 days of debilitating cramps and enough bleeding to use a super tampon in 45min.
28	81	I took ibuprofen and still had some painful but tolerable cramps.
28	82	I only have some light spotting that requires panty liners, however, the cramps and spotting are decreasing with each day.
28	83	My first two periods afterward were heavier, crampy, and less predictable, but after that they got back on schedule, and the cramps are no worse now than before the IUD.
28	84	I am spotting just a little, and the cramps are still doing pretty bad.
28	85	As for the first few days after, the cramps were bad, I'll admit that.
28	86	I have never had period cramps before then so I will admit I was pretty miserable, but it was definitely worth it in the long run!
28	87	When the Dr measures your cervix, thats the worst sharp cramps.
28	88	It feels like sharp, stabbing cramps.
28	89	I also had extremely bad cramping along with it; I never got cramps with my period before getting this.
28	90	During the procedure I had 3 intense cramps & it was done.
28	91	But every month around my period my cramps were even worse than the ones I got during insertion.
28	92	I had cramps in between periods the whole time.
28	93	The doc told me it causes some cramps but it goes away after some months.I got it in October 2016.
28	94	The cramps were TERRIBLE.
28	95	The cramps lasted for about 1 1/2 weeks.
28	96	The cramps are painful and come and go!
28	97	I have had the IUD in since 2009,  it caused cramps for about 3 days, spotting then was normal.
28	98	My periods were heavier and my cramps more severe for the first three months, but after that they returned to nearly the same as before.
28	99	I had cramps and heavy bleeding for about 3 days after and then the cramps went away and the bleeding lightened.
28	100	I have heavy periods and pretty bad cramps so painful periods are common for me but this was a whole other thing.
28	101	Insertion was painful for a few seconds and cramps for a few minutes then just general tenderness.
28	102	I found out after a year of terrifyingly heavy periods that lasted all but 5 days a month and cramps that made me an invalid regularly that this iud contains copper plated nickel.
28	103	I'd say the cramps during my period were intense for a year until they started to calm down.
28	104	Now the cramps are more bearable but I hate that they last longer than a week.
28	105	Love it and it didnt mess with my period at all much besides increase cramps.
28	106	But today, boy have these cramps been hell.
28	107	My flow has always been heavy, so it's nothing of a shock but the cramps have been significantly stronger.
28	108	I fell asleep for 2 hours when I got home, and when I woke up, I felt like I was having bad period cramps.
28	109	I had cramps for the next couple days then it stopped.
28	110	I got my period 3 days after insertion, no cramps,  not heavier than normal and it was over in 3 days.
28	111	ParaGard gave me really bad cramps and heavy periods for the first two months.
28	112	After that my cramps went away completely and I have not had them again since then.
28	113	I would recommend this to anyone that can bear through the cramps for the first few months.
28	114	Definitely helped, only experienced a few cramps and it was done within minutes.
28	115	I had bad cramps for 3 days, then they backed off.
28	116	Had the IUD inserted on 08/01/2016 in August, no cramps initially but About 2 hours after the insertion i started feeling cramping but nothing Advil and a warm towel didnt help with.
28	117	my cramps were so bad with the iud, i would almost start crying.
28	118	now I've had the iud out for two months and my BV has completely gone away, i still have eczema, and i get NO cramps with my period
28	119	I got the IUD inserted at 1pm and Its almost 8pm and the cramps are a little painful but its nothing I cant handle.
28	120	From the moment I got Skyla, I had nonstop cramps and bleeding.
28	121	When she inserted the Paragard it wasn't nearly as bad as the measuring but still that is just cramps.
28	122	However, for me, the cramps and spasms that occurred afterwards were the worst part.
28	123	My pain tolerance is pretty high but those cramps kicked my bum!
28	124	I was a bit crampy the week after I got it inserted then I started my period, which I had bad cramps for the first day or so, but it was fine after the beginning of my period.
28	125	After my period was over, i only got cramps every so often about a week or so after, but it's been great.
28	126	Hello, just wanted to tell you guys about my experience with Paragard, I am 34 and have 4 boys, so I wanted a birth control that would be for years, since I don't want no more kids, so I chose Paragard, it has been a month since I got it, when I got it inserted I just felt a mild cramp and that was it, I was in my period so It was much easier to get it in because of my cervix been more open, after I got it in and went home home I had mild cramps and backaches but nothing that I couldn't manage, and my period lasted for 14 days that was the only part that I hated the most, I was almost ready to take it off, When my period stop,(yay), I love it no problems while having sex, everything is back to normal...
28	127	The first few days I had mild spotting and a few cramps.
28	128	My periods are now heavier for a day or two of my cycle, but have gotten less heavy in the past 6 months, and I occasionally have light cramps.
28	129	10 years is worth the cramps.
28	130	Minor cramps during menstration, whereas before I never experienced cramping.
28	131	The next two days I couldnt get out of bed due to the horrible cramps.
28	132	When j got it inserted it felt like cramps, but nothing that I couldn't handle and I was just fine after the insertion.
28	133	Although the procedure itself was quick and somewhat painless, bleeding and cramps were a serious issue over the following weeks.
28	134	The cramps were painful to the point where it was debilitating but taking painkillers helped a lot.
28	135	It was also after six months that I experienced cramps and backaches so severe that at times I had to use a heating pad for my back.
28	136	But the cramps were pretty strong.
28	137	No cramps, medium to heavy flow.
28	138	No pain or cramps.
28	139	cramps, random shooting pains.
28	140	I ended up have extreme cramps a couple days after getting it causing me to miss work.
28	141	But once my first period came I had the worst cramps of my life to where I felt dizzy almost to the point of passing out!
28	142	I went from no cramps to cramping often.
28	143	The procedure was honestly sooooo terrifying (never had children & cramps are always painful) but It didn't hurt as much as I thought.
28	144	The cramps the Paragard gave me felt nothing like my normal period cramps.
28	145	I've always had bad cramps and a pretty decent flow.
28	146	Honestly, I can deal with the cramps and 10 day long periods.
28	147	I had the worst cramps of my life, I felt like I was going to pass out from pain and seriously contemplated going to the emergency room.
28	148	The first 6 months I had internal pain with my body getting used to a foreign object becoming permanently a part of me, but after those months I get my regular monthly cycles (sometimes they are off but that is normal) and my cramps are the same as before I got it inserted.
28	149	She informed me that there would be, "three large cramps" with this procedure, and she was not kidding.The cramps were the most intense I've ever felt, she said women who've had children compared them to minor contractions.
28	150	My cramps have been very severe ever since I got it done 4 hours ago, even on 1,000mg of Ibuprofen, 20mg Tramadol, 100mg Naproxen
28	151	Its 2 of the sharpest, most intense cramps you'll never want to feel again.
28	152	Anyways, i spotted fairly lightly (I have light periods) for 3-4 days and mild to moderate cramps.
28	153	But after the cramps and spotting subsided my (sex) life improved thanks to no more worrying!
28	154	My periods were light before insertion and I've never had cramps.
28	155	Still no cramps.
28	156	The following days were full of cramps and bleeding.
28	157	The cramps are bearable but I can't survive without pain relievers.
28	158	I had stopped getting periods and with the paragraud am getting my period regularly again, there heavier than am used to but nothing too bad another side affect is the cramps there occissional but i nothing i cant tolerate.
28	159	It wasn't bothersome, and I was too occupied dealing with those killer cramps.
28	160	Since i got it put in ive had mild cramps occasionally and feel slightly bloated but im assuming my uterus is still adjusting.
28	161	Insertion was fine; it was quick, and it feels like period cramps when it's being inserted.
28	162	The worst cramps you've ever had times 56 :( if you have the option have someone drive you home.
28	163	The cramps were unbearable.
28	164	First 2 yrs was heavy bleeding, spotting all the time & bad cramps with a period of 10-14 days.
28	165	I did talk with my reg doc, and she said a copper IUD can cause a hormone imbalance, and this is prbly why I haven't had my period and have had hot flashes, the way to fix this I would have to go on BCP, it completely defeats the purpose of having a non hormonal IUD.I have constant cramps, pain during intercourse, gained 20 pounds (in 4 months), hot flashes, I smell like stinky fishing bait ,and I'm positive I can feel it when I move the wrong way.
28	166	Just felt like period cramps.
28	167	I cramped with really dull cramps that evening.
28	168	I was having cramps that made me yelp aloud and miss work, my periods were very heavy (like overnight pad plus a heavy tampon every two hours), and I had regular nausea.
28	169	I heard I was supposed to have period like cramps, but none yet.
28	170	But I've never had cramps to begins with.
28	171	The cramps were terrible about 6 hours later.
28	172	However, my once serious menstural cramps were completely gone (no midol needed).
28	173	I never had cramps before Paragard, but I still think the product is worth it.
28	174	Also the cramps are not great.
28	175	Honestly this is the best birth control ever and I had heavy periods and cramps but heavy bleeding can come from having low iron.
28	176	A day of extreme cramps in exchange for 12 years of no hormones and preventing pregnancy?
28	177	My cramps are not nearly as bad as they used to be, they've actually disappeared for the most part, which was a pleasant surprise, especially as someone who tends to get pretty severe period cramps.
28	178	The cramp felt exactly the same as menstrual cramps.
28	179	Menstrual: for my surprise my period is the same, is not heavier, I don't have abnormal cramps, just the usual ones for the first or second day, days are the same for me, Overall every person and every body reacts different but to have your own experience you just have to try it,  for me has been the best BC I have used.. Don't just judge the IUD Based on what you read and give it try.
28	180	The only negative thing I have found is that I get cramps monthly.
28	181	I NEVER experienced menstrual cramps before I got the ParaGard, I now know what my friends always complained about.
28	182	My first period after was worse than normal but no bloodbath, cramps were sharper but not unbearable.
28	183	I have pains during intercourse, cramps, heavier periods.
28	184	I just got my Paragard IUD inserted, today and I will say the insertion was not painful for me I felt light cramps feeling just when you are going to have your period.
28	185	Realistically it feels like one of those bad period cramps that make you wanna curl into a ball that lasts for about two minutes.
28	186	The cramps suck today but I'd take cramps over pregnancy or hormonal bc side effects any day.
28	187	Got cramps within a few hours.
28	188	My first period lasted about 6 days, with severe cramps so I had to use a heating pad (didn't have to use one before Paragard).
28	189	Totally worth all the cramps and heavier periods.
28	190	The procedure was not bad did not feel any cramps during the procedure but had cramps for 24 hours after it.
28	191	Tried to minimize the cramps by taking the highest does of ibuprofen.
28	192	Had no cramps the next day just spotting for a few days and periods were normal no change.
28	193	My cramps are much worse, and the worst part is I get my period almost every 2-3 weeks.
28	194	I'm having minor cramps now.
28	195	Yes you have cramps and slightly longer periods, but you get your period almost to the hour every month.
28	196	I have always had heavier/worse cramps than most people I know so this has been nothing for me (at least nothing some advil or a little wine can't fix!)
28	197	I've had slight cramps, and spotting.
28	198	Since insertion, and this is now going on over a month, I have had cramps.
28	199	I take 600mg of ibuprofen 2x/day and put a heat pad on at night when cramps seem to peak in intensity.
28	200	Just random small cramps but that's all.
28	201	For the first 3 months, I bled much heavier than normal and experienced some severe cramps.
28	202	However, by the 4th month, my bleeding and cramps significantly reduced.
28	203	The insertion was not too painful, having the speculum inserted for about 3 minutes was uncomfortable and it just felt like period cramps the rest of the day.
28	204	On the IUD, mine lasted a few extra (light flow) days, and only on 1 of them did I need painkillers for cramps -- normal for me!
28	205	Really bad cramps and I spotted the entire time.
28	206	I have spotting up to a week before my period and cramps that are really strong.
28	207	Second day only mild cramps.
28	208	I'd get these horrid back cramps that got worse and worse every period.
28	209	About an hour after I began to feel cramps and some pain.
28	210	I also had terrible cramps and pains.
28	211	Now I have had seven periods and it is back to normal with just very minor cramps.
28	212	HOWEVER, even at 1 yr, periods aren't cyclical, sometimes 2x/mo, intermittent spotting, dry blood residues, so I avoid sex sometimes b/c it's embarrassing.This is ironic b/c birth control should enable me to have sex more!Also, the cramps are more painful than any pain I have ever experienced.
28	213	I immediately had what felt like my usual, period cramps but a bit worse, but those went away after 5ish hrs.
28	214	For the next 3 days I has cramps and my period continued longer than usual--- I took tylenol to help relieve the pain.
28	215	Up until my first period after insertion, I would randomly get cramps.
28	216	When I got my period I did have cramps, but nothing unbearable like before, although it was super heavy & lasted much much longer (about 6 days total).
28	217	Now, on month 6, I no longer get random cramps.
28	218	I had mind blowing, sweat inducing cramps throughout the day and a 6 month pregnant looking bloat I couldn't get rid of.
28	219	For the first 6 months everything was fine, then i started to get terrible cramps that were almost dibilitating.
28	220	I took naproxen about 8 hrs ahead of time and even took some before I went in so the cramps wouldn't hit me immediately afterwards.
28	221	I've had period cramps worse than that.
28	222	Honestly, the first month/2 months I had random terrible cramps that would last approximately 2 minutes (more like contractions than menstrual ) they'd come out of no where and happen daily.
28	223	My 1st period was longer, much heavier and the cramps were absolute torture.
28	224	I'm experiencing more cramps (have subsided) and heavier flow 2 days in but hopefully that will improve soon.
28	225	I did feel pukey off and on for a while but after only 2 months my cramps are back to normal!
28	226	Ladies passing out, bleeding all the time, cramps from hell etc.
28	227	the cramps were a little different than normal but advil knocked that right out.
28	228	I do have heavier period but no bad cramps.
28	229	I would cramp during my period and I never cramp before the IUD.
28	230	I spot and cramp literally all month long.
28	231	I did not find insertion painful, more like a heavy period cramp that lasted 10-20 seconds.
28	232	I don't really cramp and when I do it's not too painful.
28	233	Feels like a deep strong cramp, tolerable cramp.
28	234	After that, there was a mild cramp for the rest of the day and some spotting.
28	235	Felt like a bad cramp that lasted like 8 secs.
28	236	It felt less bad than a stomach cramp, and a LOT less bad than a muscle cramp.
28	237	I was sore for about 3 days, my periods stayed the same, and everything was normal.. the only thing I would point on though was I kept having a strong cramp in my tail bone and sex was quite uncomfortable!
28	238	It was like one really really bad cramp.
28	239	Pain wise: It was literally like a bad cramp for a few seconds and done.
28	240	It will in fact hurt however it will not be unbearable, you will just react to it because it's like a cramp x100.
28	241	Insertion was quick and easy, felt like a cramp, but was gone moments afterward.
28	242	It felt like a huge cramp and the pain went away the second she was done which took about 2 minutes.
28	243	Of course if you're uterus hasn't been through any changes, it will feel like a big cramp and discomfort.
28	244	With the Paraguard my first two days are the only days I cramp and it's not too bad.My flow is pretty normal I can get away with wearing a regular tampon and it lasts 6 days.I love it because I can predict my period and it is very accurate.
28	245	You feel a little pinch and a small cramp and you are done.
28	246	The insertion felt like a knife in my uterus, followed by a mega period cramp.
28	247	I have normal menstrual cycle..it isn't too heavy..and I don't cramp every month; however some months I do.
28	248	It wasn't much worse than a bad menstrual cramp.
28	249	It just felt a little funny, but when he inserted it there was a tiny baby cramp that went away almost instantly.
28	250	There's one cramp when holding on to the uterus to keep it in place, and one more cramp to measure the uterus and insert the device.
28	251	I have had the paragrad iud for 1 year and my periods are horrible I pour blood and cramp so bad I can't move.
28	252	I have had numerous sports injuries (currently recovering from a torn calcaneofibular ligament in my ankle from soccer) and nothing compares to the cramp pain that I am continually experiencing.
28	253	The pain felt like a strong cramp and lasted for about 3 seconds.
28	254	I cramp still, maybe once every four months.
28	255	In real life, the procedure was quick, mildly uncomfortable, and as soon as the IUD was in, I got a dull, period-like cramp that stuck around til that night.
28	256	When I first had it put in, I did cramp for almost a week.
28	257	There was some pressure and cramping that didn't feel like a menstrual cramp, but close.
28	258	The first cramp was decently painful.
28	259	it hurt getting inserted and when my cervix was clamped open, but the pain only lasted about 5 seconds and it was only a little bit worse than a regular period cramp.
28	260	I had one cramp and one small pinch and that was it.
28	261	Every so often I'll get a dull cramp but that's IT.
28	262	It definitely hurt a bit, felt like a long lasting cramp and I was told my cervix is very tight.
28	263	The pain felt like a pinch not a cramp.
28	264	Also I was bloated and just mildly cramp (like the day before your period) the whole time.
28	265	Felt like a period cramp mixed with having to pee.
28	266	I experienced discomfort and pain in my ovaries, instead of my regular period cramping.
28	267	Went to my appointment expecting to be in a lot of pain, getting it inserted was honestly very uncomfortable but I took it and after was cramping a bit on and off and began to spot.
28	268	Afterwards, there was cramping and bleeding but that was expected.
28	269	Yes, there was more blood and more cramping than I was used to but nothing some advil can't fix.
28	270	After my first period, no cramping or spotting in between cycles and my cycle is completely regular.
28	271	The first  month was heavy and I experienced a lot of painful cramping every single day.
28	272	The second month was more spotting, but still a lot of cramping.
28	273	Basically it was horrible bleeding heavily, cramping horribly was how my past 7 yrs have been.
28	274	A slight pinch and a little bit of cramping and so quick he said “I’m almost done” and I was in shock how fast it went - not even 5 minutes that I had been there, more like 2-3 and it was over!
28	275	Before when I wasn't on bc  or on one of the others I mentioned I would have slight to no cramping and very light periods lasting less than 7 days.
28	276	Since I've had the paraguard I experience extreme cramping and very heavy periods having to use 3-4 super plus tampons for the first 3 days and the periods last longer than before.
28	277	I had no pain just felt tired that day but besides that the cramping was very mild feeling nothing really (lasting only 2 days) It’s been 1 week so far and I feel like nothing is there.
28	278	My migraines have intensified, & I often have cramping.
28	279	In the first 4 months after insertion I had moderate to severe cramping and was informed by my OB that this was normal.
28	280	From the beginning I had heavier periods and cramping so bad I couldn't get out of bed for at least a day.
28	281	I occasionally have some cramping during my periods.
28	282	So heavy I had to wear a pad and a jumbo tampon and change every 2 hours HORRIBLE cramping to where my only relieve was laying in bed curled up with heating pad.
28	283	Since then heavy periods and horrible cramping My cycle has been the same up until now.
28	284	I'm 11 days late with horrible cramping.
28	285	The first few months I had severe cramping about a week before I got my period, but that's no longer an issue.
28	286	Ever since  they placed the IUD I've experienced really bad cramping .
28	287	The cramping is so bad it feels like I am having contractions .
28	288	I hope they go away maybe it's my body trying to get used to it who knows but if they cramping doesn't go away I am going to have it removed .
28	289	The pain is too much and I don't think I can handle 10 yrs with this type of cramping .
28	290	And after reading that so many people have gotten pregnant with it makes me think it's pointless to even suffer with the cramping .
28	291	Unfortunately, I've always had severe cramping and heavy periods.
28	292	So, when my doctor explained that the IUD would cause cramping and heavier bleeding, I thought "it can't be any worse then what I'm experiencing now".
28	293	In addition to the spotting, I would have cramping throughout the ENTIRE month!
28	294	I did have super heavy periods and heavy cramping during my time with paragard.
28	295	But I barely felt anything at all and so far no cramping at all either.
28	296	After those few months however, I had lighter periods, no cramping and everything was wonderful, until about a year later I went in for a ultrasound check up, only to discover the device had disappeared.
28	297	My appointment was done with my doctor and a sonogram technician she was able to implant the IUD while fully being able to see inside of cervix I had mild cramping and went home and had a mild.
28	298	The insertion process wasn't bad I had mild cramping during insertion and strong menstrual cramping after which lasted 2 days max.
28	299	However, my experience was heavier periods, extreme cramping and then a pregnancy that resulted in an abortion.
28	300	The cramping is no exaggeration.
28	301	Fast forward to the first night/day, cramping was expected, but nothing that an OTC pain reliever couldn’t get rid of.
28	302	Periods last about 5-6 days, with cramping only lasting the first 2 ½ days.
28	303	I had cramping horribly bad and heavy  periods, nausea, vomiting, upset stomach.
28	304	When it was inserted, I did have pain but that was mainly just strong cramping.
28	305	She said I would feel cramping and pressure but felt nothing at all.
28	306	Been non-stop heavy bleeding & cramping for 4 months straight.
28	307	I did bleed lightly for about 4 days after the insertion, hardly any cramping.
28	308	I start with spotting and finish spotting and cramping.
28	309	I had light cramping with my periods prior to the IUD insertion and my cramping has not changed significantly at all.
28	310	The first few months were tender and I did have some increased cramping initially but it returned to my normal within a few months.
28	311	The doctor and nurse at the clinic I went to both warned that it would be very painful for a short time, but it was less than 30 seconds of sudden cramping, followed by a day of very dull cramping.
28	312	The doctor mentioned that if the insertion was relatively painless (it was for me), then the cramping experienced later, during the first days of a period, would also be very manageable as well.
28	313	I'm experiencing a little cramping and bloating now but I was expecting a lot worse considering the other comments.
28	314	Heavy periods, intense cramping, night sweats during my period.
28	315	This time though, the cramping and back ache is excruciating.
28	316	It hurt a little when inserted but the pain and cramping started slowly and now it's a 13 on a scale of 1-10.
28	317	It's not steady cramping and pain.
28	318	I got medication to soften my cervix the night before, went in Tuesday and it was uncomfortable but way less painful than I thought (she said I have a high pain tolerance) it is Sunday and the cramping is bad, my lower back & abdomen are bothering me but the bleeding has stopped (I even started my period the day of insertion) I will review again in a month or so
28	319	Easy insertion, NO cramping, NO heavy flow -- I wish I'd gotten a ParaGard IUD sooner!
28	320	Afterwards I had mild cramping and spotting for a few days, then it went away.
28	321	The next few days consisted of some strong cramping that came in cycles, but it only required one dose of 400mg of ibuprofen a day to help with that.
28	322	The doctor and her assistant were very helpful and walked me through the whole process, but nothing could prepare me for the pinching cramping pain.
28	323	Ibuprofen wouldn't cut it for me so I had to take something a bit stronger with a glass of wine and a heating pad, but other than that the cramping is definitely a lot better than it was 5 hours ago.
28	324	It wasn't painful at all the only time I felt a hard pinch was when the doctor said he would measure my uterus I felt when he inserted the IUD but it was not painful at all.. when I went home I felt cramping throughout the day but ibuprofen did the work I haven't had any bleeding at all ...I will update in a few weeks!
28	325	Ever since, I have had little cramping and my periods have been ever so slightly heavier than usual but not that bad!
28	326	So I had paragard inserted about two weeks ago insertion process was just very bad cramping that continued for that entire day but it actually wasn't too bad.
28	327	My side effects may be TMI but they are horrible vaginal odor that is non stop, moderate cramping after sex, and non stop discharge.
28	328	Just some mild cramping.
28	329	I had a small amount of spotting that day, no cramping, felt fine the next day.
28	330	So far only experienced light spotting with no cramping.
28	331	I am still cramping.
28	332	It was a little uncomfortable but I actually laughed at the cramping because it didn't hurt.
28	333	Afterwards I felt a little cramping but nothing terrible.
28	334	No cramping after.
28	335	And while it is very effective for a very long time I wouldn't recommend it to any one because it caused me terrible pains during my cycle and occasionally off cycle of have very strong and painful cramping.
28	336	I had really bad cramping, light bleeding, and acid reflux from the cytotec.
28	337	Insertion and removal were quick and almost painless with some mild cramping.
28	338	I had very minimal cramping and some bleeding for a week, then did not even notice it was there.
28	339	I was cramping everyday and I would take 1000 mg of acetaminophen and nothing.
28	340	I'm now having mild cramping with the start of my period.
28	341	When I first had it put in my periods were very heavy with more cramping.
28	342	After I went home I started cramping a little.
28	343	After the first few days I stopped cramping and bleeding and can no longer feel it at all.
28	344	I had my second child a couple of months prior and the pain from the Insertion was just mild cramping.
28	345	I'm taking the rest of the day to watch movies and have chocolate, my lower back is a little achey and I'm cramping, but that's it.
28	346	I developed anxiety, depression, panic attacks while driving (I'm a professional driver), bloating, cramping, feeling extremely fatigued all the time, constant back and neck pain, major hair loss, anger, headaches (I never suffer from headaches because I hydrate all day).
28	347	After 6 months the cramping wasn't as bad but the length of period remained.
28	348	So now I have the paraguard nd I've had it in for 1 1/2 years with no issues...  First day a little cramping nd spotted for three days very lightly...
28	349	Had a bit of cramping during the insertion but it didnt last long.
28	350	Didn't have a lot of cramping throughout the day like I expected, I cleaned the house and everything without a problem.
28	351	Upon having the iud inserted and placed, there was very minimal cramping.
28	352	I've had periods with worse cramping, for sure.
28	353	Just some slight cramping the first week and the second week I started my period and had a lot more cramping that I'm use to on a period but nothing that made me stay home from work.
28	354	Just more cramping and more bleeding on my period, and I only bled a lot for one day and cramped bad for the first day.
28	355	Since having Paraguard inserted I went from having no cramping at all around my period to having one or two instances per month of pretty painful cramping.
28	356	After that it was bearable pain and cramping.
28	357	Also, I had mild cramping in the beginning and now I have no cramping at all!
28	358	When she inserted the IUD it was like a very sharp cramping pain .
28	359	It was cramping to the point where I couldn't even stand .
28	360	Other than intense random cramping, I was extremely happy.
28	361	My OBGYN said the spotting and cramping were normal, but after six months they seemed to just get worse.
28	362	When my OB had to measure my uterus that is the only part that hurt due to the cramping it caused.
28	363	No cramping or pain at all after.
28	364	Some cramping afterwards and bleeding for quite a few days after.
28	365	Very mild cramping after like the onset of a period..you bleed a little for a day.
28	366	No cramping yet.
28	367	Otherwise the insertion was not too bad the cramping isn't too bad either and having a peace of mind for ten years is a plus!
28	368	Since then I have had severe cramping off and on.
28	369	I'm on day 4 of my period now and the cramping comes and goes but when it comes it is SEVERE.
28	370	I get some cramping with my period but it is completely manageable and does not keep me from exercising and going about my normal activities.
28	371	and now 8 months later...aside from occasional minor cramping, nothing else changed.
28	372	30 minutes after the procedure, extreme cramping set in- Ibuprofen, heating pads, and someone to listen to you whine will be very helpful.
28	373	Insertion didn't hurt other than cramping while they were measuring how far to put my IUD.
28	374	I had light cramping for about two days and spotting and bleeding for about 5 days which is expected.
28	375	I can understand initial heavy cramping and bleeding that a few have mentioned.
28	376	I had paragard for a year and a half and had cramping the whole time with terrible long heavy periods.
28	377	There will be cramping.
28	378	Minimal cramping with insertion, took less than a minute, very effective and allows pregnancy immediately after removal.
28	379	But some side effects I had were; yeast infections, fatigue, weight gain, migraines, cramping, dizziness, nausea, racing heart, brain fog, hair loss, eye sensitivity, brain pressure, and brain shakes.
28	380	The cramping I experienced the day of the implant procedure was mild and made better by tylenol.
28	381	I felt light cramping during the insertion.
28	382	Fast forward 9 1/2 months and the ONLY pitfall has been the monthly cramping during ovulation and the day before my period begins.
28	383	You do get heavier and longer periods and slight cramping that I use to never get.
28	384	I've experieced some spotting and cramping since, but not too bad.
28	385	So far only slight cramping experienced and very minimal bleeding.
28	386	I remember it being a quick process and just slight cramping when it was inserted.
28	387	Having it inserted sucked, I had a lot of sharp cramping.
28	388	2 days of cramping and heavy bleeding after.
28	389	I felt very slight cramping and that was it.
28	390	My breasts are always sore and I have bad cramping 3 out or 4 weeks of the month.
28	391	The first time I had lots of cramping and heavy periods but the 2nd time I was hoping it would be better and it was actualy worse.
28	392	I can deal with heavy periods and cramping but in addition, I have developed pain in the lower back, it was pretty bad, feeling of stabbing constantly.
28	393	I was prepared for the worst, but in reality it was about 30 seconds of discomfort, followed by a few hours of light cramping.
28	394	Then my partner began complaining that he felt it poking him during sex and I would have cramping after sex.
28	395	I had painful cramping after the removal and am now feeling upset that I have to find another alternative for birth control- again.
28	396	As for periods, I have experienced no cramping but 3-4 extremely heavy days (soaking a super plus tampon every hour and a half) and then 2-3 very light days.
28	397	It did not hurt that bad to insert just a lot of pressure and mild cramping after.
28	398	Changes I've noticed since I have it: heavier periods and heavy cramping.
28	399	After insertion I just had light cramping.
28	400	i didn't experience any cramping or lightheadedness immediately after insertion.
28	401	I had mild cramping and spotting for about a week after and no cramping since.
28	402	It's just an intense cramping feeling, & I goes by quick, like 5 minutes.
28	403	Just cramping.
28	404	The procedure was simple: lay back, take deep breaths through the cramping, and you're done.
28	405	I felt dizzy afterwards and was cramping and spotting for 2 days.
28	406	The 1st month there was a lot of light bleeding and occasional cramping while the IUD "settled" in.
28	407	The cramping at the start of my 1st period was hell, 2nd period less so, and now 3rd period almost pre-insertion levels.
28	408	Some cramping, but it was manageable.
28	409	it wasn't bad at all, and I had very very minor cramping in the days following.
28	410	Insertion was painful and periods were a lot more crampy for about 3 months after.
28	411	I was on my cycle at the time so after the procedure I was feeling crampy like a cycle.
28	412	My first period was crampy and heavy, but all were normal after that.
28	413	A little crampy the first couple days after insertion but that's it, now three months later My periods are shorter and less heavy
28	414	Same as everyone else, pretty crampy when getting it inserted.
28	415	The insertion was crampy but it only took a few minutes.
28	416	my next period was better, less crampy and it wasn't as heavy as before.
28	417	Felt like a pap only a little more crampy.
28	418	Insertion was uncomfortable for 30 seconds, just felt crampy afterwards.
28	419	I was crampy for about 1 week while thing settled, but I took 1 alieve and the pain subsided.
28	420	The next few periods were also painfully crampy with heavy bleeding but I noticed the pain decreased with each period.
28	421	Adjusting period wasn't bad, spotting here and there for about 2 weeks.
28	422	I have had regular, off-colored discharge & frequent spotting.
28	423	I just got my paragard inserted today...I didn't feel them putting the IUD in, I have very minimal spotting but it has stopped for now.
28	424	I developed overactive bladder and spotting a lot between periods and pain during sex.
28	425	Yet I also have the constant spotting, and odd color discharge.
28	426	Before IUD, my periods lasted 5 days, now they last 7 days + I have HEAVY spotting almost the entire month.
28	427	My period starts with spotting and rather gross looking discharge.
28	428	Had very light spotting for 2 weeks.
28	429	You'll experience spotting, no vag insertions for 3 days but if you're like me and hormones ruin how you feel, the 10 minutes of uncomfortably is worth it.
28	430	I'd say the worst part would be the longer/heavier periods and random spotting.
28	431	Just spotting here and there.
28	432	My 1st period came with the paragard I had brown spotting a few day before it actually started, it was a little hard to tell when it actually started.
28	433	I had 10-12 day periods each cycle, but there wasn't a single period I had without some type of leak happening and I wound up having so much spotting I would occasionally have 2 periods a month.
28	434	Yes there is still occasionally spotting and my period is a little heavier than it used to be, but I won't have to worry about pregnancy for the next 10-12 years.
28	435	Some spotting between periods.
28	436	A month later I had a new one put in which I've had for a year now, and though I still get painful, heavy periods with some spotting between (a trade off I can handle),I really am happy with my decision to get ParaGard.
28	437	I honestly didn't have any spotting between then and my first period post-insertion.
28	438	No spotting in between.
28	439	No spotting during the month.
28	440	And many times, I have spotting in between.
28	441	It took 7 months for my body to adhere to a regular cycle with no spotting; however, the pain and heaviness remained.
28	442	I bled for the entire time I had Paragard, with 2 heavy periods and constant spotting in between.
28	443	It took all of 30 seconds to remove  but did leave me spotting.
28	444	Between spotting and periods I was bleeding almost nonstop first few weeks.
28	445	Then at about 6 1/2 months in I started spotting randomly every day and it did not end until my ParaGard expelled itself at 9 1/2 months.
28	446	Honestly, I was happy when my IUD expelled-I was already done with it after spotting nonstop for three months.
28	447	Some light spotting in between periods.
28	448	I became very depressed, I bled during sex as well as experienced a lot of discomfort and had spotting for the entire 8 months I was on it.
28	449	Periods were 2 weeks spotting, 1 week HEAVY FLOW.
28	450	Had spotting which now three days later turned to a light flow.
28	451	I had spotting for a week after the insertion.
28	452	I've had constant spotting for the last 3 1\2 months after I got it placed 4 months ago, and when the spotting stopped 2 wks ago and I have not had my period since having it placed, just spotting.
28	453	I did have spotting after.
28	454	I have light spotting that is beginning to stop.
28	455	"I've had my Paragard for 5 months.I experienced spotting the following 2 days.
28	456	The spotting was as the doctor said it would be like.
28	457	Then I kept spotting.
28	458	And spotting.
28	459	I also had spotting during that week but then it went away.
28	460	A few days of spotting & then my period started.
28	461	Cramping and spotting lasted for 2 days now I don't feel it.
28	462	So, after procedure - first two days spotting, then period, which lasted quite long (but I haven't had a period in about 6 years, so ja).
28	463	The next week: light spotting.
28	464	The other days are light to normal, with several days of spotting after.
28	465	I got it 6 weeks postpartum and didn't feel anything when inserted but did have some spotting.
28	466	Now I'm feeling fine and there's some light spotting and clots.
28	467	Years later I had Mirena put in due to my long spotting periods.
28	468	The heavy periods & spotting occasionally is worth it.
28	469	I had immediate bleeding and I am having a little spotting today but nothing I can't handle.
28	470	I also had continuous spotting for about a week.
28	471	The procedure was quick and a slight pinch upon placement a little bit of spotting after but other than that my period has remained unaffected, sometimes I do feel the strings but that is no biggie.
28	472	There is a bit of spotting but nothing to bad.
28	473	Anyways, funny enough after a few days spotting this week my actual period has started and is 100% PAINLESS.
28	474	Some spotting, but no babies for 10 years!
28	475	I have had a period since insertion, I spotted the first 2 days, had full period 4 days and did a slight spotting on the last day.
28	476	My fingers are so swollen I can't get my rings off, and I bleed and spot 3 weeks out of the month.
28	477	But I was wrong... Not only was I having heavy bleeding during my period, but I started to spot between periods.
28	478	I would have a mini period in between my main period and would spot every few days during my non-period times.
28	479	When the insertion was finished, the nurse provided a pad to put in my underwear, and stated that I will spot for about 2-3 days.
28	480	It was like I could constantly feel it even though my doctor insisted it was in the correct spot.
28	481	Since then I've had a lot of  clear discharge and every couple days I will spot, with mild belly aches.
28	482	My reasons to remove included the following: 1) shortly before my period I would spot for approximately 3-4 days and then proceed to bleed for a minimum of 9 days 2) constant vaginal discharge which resulted in me having to wear a panty liner daily and 3) since it's insertion, my cravings for sugar have tremendously increased.
28	483	I did spot for a couple days after but I was told thats normal.
28	484	I spotted and cramped until my next period which was about 2 weeks.
28	485	I spotted the next day which lead to me bleeding heavily for two days.
28	486	I spotted the first few weeks, as expected.
28	487	I've spotted so far.
28	488	They gave me a pad to wear home but I never even spotted.
28	489	Next day I spotted a little, just wore a panty liner.
28	490	I spotted for about two -three days but after that I was fine.
28	491	I spotted for two or three days following the procedure and only cramped the day of.
28	492	When I don’t have a headache, I feel as though my brain does not fit in my skull.
28	493	I have had the Paragard for 2 weeks and have had a headache everyday since the 3rd day.
28	494	I’ve been experiencing severe headaches with suddenly onset like something I had never felt before.
28	495	Hair loss, brain fog, anxiety, depression, fatigue, mood swings, headaches, nausea, & the list goes on.
28	496	Opted for this as the hormones triggered headaches.
28	497	I had been on the birth control pill for ten years or so, but was unable to continue taking hormonal birth control due to issues with migraine headaches and the potential for stroke.
28	498	I've been experiencing more headaches as well and that has never happened to me.
28	499	I experienced anxiety, racing thoughts, repetitive thoughts, empty feelings, extreme anger and resentment, extremely itchy labia and skin, tremoring vision, nausea, headaches, terrible back pain, sharp joint pains, ear aches, sadness, and the worst TOTAL LOSS OF SEX DRIVE.
28	500	Heavy period,  headaches,  bloating,  mood swings and weight gain about 15 pounds.
28	501	I was so dizzy, headaches when i went to bed and when i woke up, fatigue bad, mood swings where i was angry then crying for now reason, i lost half of my hair it was coming out in clumps, panic attacks that resembled strokes no joke my hands would turn into claws and i seize up.
28	502	I've been having it but I get a really heavy periods and big headaches!
28	503	I also noticed I have started getting terrible headaches again...which makes no sense considering this is non-hormonal and this would normally happen when I took hormonal birth control.
28	504	15 days a month of migraine.
28	505	The migraine copper detox is a long dedicated life alerting progress.
28	506	I'm always tired, something always aches, and I get extremely terrible migraines, which I never had before.
28	507	Mood swings were very bad to the extent I was lashing out and getting arrested very heavy bleeding where it was going through my clothing and suffered many migraines.
28	508	I can't take birth control pills due to hormones gave me horrible migraines (I tried many different types).
28	509	I was getting migraines on the pill.
28	510	I am hopeful and will stick this out bc I can't have any hormonal bc any more due to migraines with aura and possibility of stroke with use.
28	511	I get migraines with aura so i cannot be on the pill.
28	512	Sex was painful like very painful and I had zero sex drive.
28	513	My sex drive has already increased, and I lost 5lbs within a week of being off the pill (added bonus).
28	514	On top of all this I am newly married and have ABSOLUTELY no sex drive.
28	515	I completely lost my sex drive.
28	516	I also noticed my sex drive went up!
28	517	I was so tired of the low sex drive that the pill gave me, so I decided to make the move to ParaGard.
28	518	The pill absolutely killed my sex drive, as it did with my sister.
28	519	After deciding that I no longer wanted to use the pill, I tried other options such as the arm implant and the patch, neither of which worked for me because they made me fat, emotional, and took away my sex drive.
28	520	My sex drive is also now higher than ever before.
28	521	Sex is uncomfortable @times & I often have no sex drive at all.
28	522	Not to mention my sex drive was nonexistent....
28	523	They made me emotional, killed my sex drive completely, and dried me out so sex was incredibly painful.
28	524	Periods are heavier and longer, but I am so relieved to 1) Have a sex drive (bad experiences with hormones) and 2) 10 years of no pills in my future!
28	525	im now noticing a kick up in my sex drive which is horrible because im celibate but grateful because on hormonal bc I would have to do everything in my power to get this feeling.
28	526	Might be too much TMI but my Sex drive has gone up since having the Paragard because it doesn't have hormones.
28	527	I switched from Nuvaring to Paragard because I hated the way the ring felt and wanted a nonhormonal option since I felt like Nuvaring robbed me of my libido.
28	528	I know it is claimed that paragard is non hormonal and will not cause weight gain.
28	529	but I really need to check around if any of you experienced weight gain like me.
28	530	Weight Gain and bloating.
28	531	I did not have any side effects of weight gain, ache, or anything.
28	532	Painful sex, depression, weight gain, anemia, insomnia, caused my gallbladder disease and if not bad enough embedded in my uterus and had to be surgically removed.
28	533	No weight gain!
28	534	I've had two paragard IUDs in my lifetime and no weight gain or craziness since there aren't any hormones and nothing to worry about!
28	535	I've gained 4kg after the insertion.
28	536	I have been dieting and exercising, cut over 1000 calories a day and gained weight.
28	537	I have gained tons of weight and I've had BV constantly since having this placed.
28	538	On the contrary I gained weight.
28	539	Only after 6 weeks of having it I started to lose hair and had two bald spots and I instantly gained 10 pounds!
28	540	I also gained 20lbs which is definitely not to do with change in diet/exercise.
28	541	I gained 50lb with no change in diet, and it's hormone free.
28	542	I have had the paragard for about 15 months and have gained 30 pounds despite working out and eating well.
28	543	I have gained a lot of weight since and recently EXTREME pain even when I'm not on my period.
28	544	I'm also forgetful and wanted a birth control that I didn't have to worry about taking every day like the pill.I tried the depo shot but gained too much weight.
28	545	The only side effects that I have had is I have cyst to rupture maybe 2x year and I gained weight right before getting this put in and I've still not been able to lose the weight.
28	546	I gained weight (I was back in my skinny jeans 5 weeks after giving birth but had to wear yoga pants again while on Paragard because of serious bloating that made me look 5 months pregnant).
28	547	I feel fatigued often, have gained 10 lbs without a dietary change, my mood swings are crazy.
28	548	However, recently I'm discovering that I've gained about 20lbs in the past 6 months.
28	549	I've always easily gained weight on birth control, that's why I went with paragard.
28	550	I read in other threads that some People have also gained weight and feel bloated in the mid section ... And some have expressed that some women might be allergic to copper ...
28	551	Was fired from my job due nausea and fatigue affecting quality of work and being on time in AM.
28	552	I had horrible panic attacks, constant feeling of nausea, digestive issues, heavy periods, and painful sex.
28	553	I am not one to bash but if you like  to see if you like feeling happy, if nausea  and head aches are not your thing Do Not  Get this Device at least until you do your research.
28	554	Originally chose due to non-hormonal option (had extreme nausea on the pill.)
28	555	I was prescribed oxycodone for the pain and some nausea pills.
28	556	Symptoms included anxiety, panic attacks and nausea mostly.
28	557	I was so freaked out I ended up going to the emergency room; because it was the weekend and I didn't want to wait to see my gyno.I had bacterial vaginosis  it was extremely painful so I realized I had to get it taken out and as soon as I got the paragard taking out the dizziness is gone the nausea was gone I had no more symptoms I do not recommend it!
28	558	I am constantly nauseous and exhausted.
28	559	I am nauseous almost every day and my periods are debilitatingly painful.
28	560	The  the insertion of the IUD was the most painful thing I've ever felt, it made me nauseous  BUT it was over within 10 minutes.
28	561	I chose this birth control because it is non-hormonal, and regular hormonal birth control makes me nauseous, depressed, have mood swings, and gain weight.
28	562	The insertion, while not painful, made me nauseous to the point where I almost passed out when I stood up.
28	563	I almost blacked out and I felt nauseous for 2 hours afterwards.
28	564	Afterwards I was nauseous and very pale- I had to sit in the office for a good 20 minutes before I could walk again.
28	565	However for a few minutes after I felt dizzy and nauseous.
28	566	My drive home I was worried because I felt extremely nauseous and faint feeling.
28	567	I wasn't nauseous or anything, just glad it was over and was very painless!
28	568	I was always dizzy and got depressed.
28	569	After it was finished I sat up and immediately felt dizzy and lightheaded.
28	570	Also  I have heart palpitations dizziness hot flashes and hairloss.
28	571	I experienced dizziness for 2 seconds then it went away.
28	572	Paragard may not contain hormones but it creates an inflammatory response that leads to water retention, inability to lose weight, and mood swings.
28	573	I've been experiencing hair loss, mood swings, memory loss, urinary tract infections.
28	574	Gained 30 pounds , mood swings like crazy , many other reactions that the doctors swore wasn't because of it.
28	575	I had only 1 friend who has the ParaGard but she said it didn't hurt a bit and was great for avoiding mood swings associated with hormonal BC.
28	576	I'm 25 single mother to 8 year old twins an IUD was my choice of birth control I've had paragard over 5 years already and I can say it's perfect haven't gotten pregnant, period lasts about 3 days, no mood swings, no pain, no heavy period.
28	577	Also, my mood swings are pretty crazy lately.
28	578	the pill made me gain an incredible amount of weight, I had terrible mood swings and lost hair.
28	579	No mood swings or anything.
28	580	Ive had the mirena and didnt like the mood swings, hormones & crazy periods.
28	581	I had bad mood swings and depression/anxiety from hormonal birth control so this is a great non-hormonal option for me!
28	582	I'm now just nervous about getting it taken out.
28	583	Oct. 25 I didn't get my cycle so now I'm nervous.
28	584	I was so nervous about inserting it in but it was painless.
28	585	I was so nervous to get the Paragard IUD after reading the awful experiences others had!
28	586	But I was nervous for no reason.
28	587	I was nervous after reading all the reviews about the insertion and I even voiced my concerns to one of the nurses at planned parenthood.
28	588	I was very nervous about getting the Paragard IUD after reading many reviews.
28	589	It was affecting my nervous system causing electrical shocks in my hands & feet.
28	590	Eager but nervous, I requested the Paragard IUD to by OBGYN.
28	591	I was nervous about the pain--even pelvic exams are uncomfortable--so I obtained tramadol b/c a study found it was the only thing that reduced insertion pain.
28	592	Just got my paragard put in this morning, couldn't sleep the night before and was so nervous the morning of.
28	593	My whole body was shaking because I was so nervous but it did not hurt.
28	594	I was so so nervous when I got to the office and he calmed me down and the whole process took maybe 10 minutes at the most.
28	595	I read so many reviews on pain and was pretty nervous going into it.
28	596	I was very nervous after reading some reviews but I hate taking birth control with hormones..so this is a great option.
28	597	I'm just overall happy about getting Paraguard, I was nervous at first because of the bad reviews, but this is a good review!
28	598	I'm a 20 y/o with no kids who's never had a Smear done and I was super nervous about getting my ParaGard in after reading a lot of reviews.
28	599	I told my Gyno I was very nervous and he prescribed me a valium to take 30 mins before arriving, It helped take the edge off.
28	600	I was so nervous and a little scared I didn't know what to expect .
28	601	I was so nervous, but sooooo sick of taking a pill everyday for 10 yrs!
28	602	I was very nervous about getting the copper IUD after reading reviews, but it was much better than I expected.
28	603	I have white coat syndrome, so I was clammy and nervous.
28	604	I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and an anti-anxiety pill 1 hour before because I was nervous.
28	605	I was nervous and anticipated a lot of pain.
28	606	I was so nervous yesterday when I went in to have my Paragard inserted.
28	607	I was nervous because I was not on my period and I had not taken any medicine for pain.
28	608	The process was fairly short but I was nervous.
28	609	Upon reading the reviews and experiences, I have to admit that I was reluctant and nervous to go on with the idea of using Paragard as birth control.
28	610	I saw saw videos on Youtube of women talking about the insertion process and how it really hurt so I was nervous but mine didn't necessarily hurt it just made me feel like puking a bit until the insertion was over.
28	611	I was very nervousness before getting the inserstion because I kept reading reveiws online over & over again.
28	612	All psychological symptoms are "normal," I'm slightly emotional and a little anxious, but I feel like myself.
28	613	However I would never recommend this iud to anyone and am very anxious to feel like myself again
28	614	I was very anxious and depressed on the ring, so I am hoping that changes with this non-hormonal option.
28	615	On a side note, I felt anxious, depressed, introverted, alone,  (I'm usually so social and confident!
28	616	I was probably more anxious for the insertion process than I needed to be.
28	617	It dumps copper into your body by hiding in the muscles and dumping it out during stress that brings mind blowing anxiety and terrible malaise during detox.
28	618	I also had a huge increase in anxiety, panic attacks, heart palpitations.
28	619	I've had horrible anxiety, depression, throwing up, not being able to get out of bed.
28	620	Unfortunately, I didn't make the connection between my ailments (extreme fatigue, anxiety, depression, digestive problems,  just to name a few) and the IUD until many years after insertion.
28	621	Caused extreme anger, anxiety, depression, irrational fears & personality change.
28	622	I also began having anxiety, panic attacks, hair loss, and decided to have it out.
28	623	Within 6 months anxiety, panic were resolved and hair loss levelled out.
28	624	I had it for about 17 months and maybe 3 months after the insertion I started feeling really bad, first just depression, insomnia and overall feeling of not being well, then I developed a bad anxiety followed by panic attacks, my heart beating like crazy from the minute I woke up, I was a wreck not able to get myself to work and be productive, I was drained, exhausted and unhappy, I was not able to enjoy anything, day after day.
28	625	), worthless and I experienced social anxiety for the first time!
28	626	Not to mention my anxiety going to levels I didn't know existed for me.
28	627	I developed anxiety and depression.
28	628	I went through years of therapy & doctors trying to give antidepressants & anti anxiety medication.
28	629	Depression & anxiety worsened.
28	630	I ended up with copper toxicity, my hair fell out in clumps, my periods were so heavy I couldn't even leave my house because I was severely eniemic...let's not mention the severe anxiety that again kept me a prisoner in my home.
28	631	I also started having anxiety (which I never have had a problem with) and then These contraction like pains that came around my period and then after.
28	632	I am normally a really positive person with a happy demeanor and I am convinced that the copper IUD threw me into depression and anxiety.
28	633	I have NEVER had depression or anxiety, and every month my moods got worse, I would cry almost everyday, I would snap at my bf or family for the smallest thing, and I felt rage almost all the time.
28	634	This did nothing for my anxiety.
28	635	On hormonal birth control I experienced heightened depression and anxiety.
28	636	Overall it served its purpose but I did have side effects I just felt tired all the time, anxiety, bloated and some more severe period symptoms in the beginning, I also started having a lot of chronic back and neck pain and just felt pretty shitty all the time, not healthy.
28	637	Back pain, breast pain, and shooting leg pain down to my foot.
28	638	I noticed that I was a weeks late for my period and I had breast tenderness.
28	639	I get moody, have tender breasts and get fluffy around the middle.
28	640	I also experienced a pH change in the first few months resulting in a vaginal infection.
28	641	After reading some reviews, I plan to take iron supplements and probiotics to prevent iron deficiency and vaginal infections.
28	642	Beginning about 3 months after insertion, developed a yeast infection that, 6 months later, has never fully gone away.
28	643	I also had yeast infection & BV almost every month because of IUD.
28	644	It caused never ending BV and yeast infections despite endless antibiotics and medications.
28	645	I got several infections (bladder infection/UTI and 3 yeast infections) all within this timeframe.
28	646	I began getting yeast infections.
28	647	Reoccurring yeast infections almost every other month.
28	648	Except a couple things.. constant yeast infections and sooooo much vaginal discharge it was so disgusting.
28	649	I have had constant yeast infections , 1 episode of UTI which I never had before in my life.
28	650	After having paragard for two years I developed what I thought were yeast infections.
28	651	I read tons and tons of reviews and was terrified to try paragard but my gyno told me that one of the causes of my frequent yeast infections was my nuvaring.
28	652	Gradually started having VERY heavy periods, constant bacterial vaginitis, and after about 3 years was no longer able to feel strings.
29	1	I never got any acne really, I would maybe get one pimple a month closer to when I was about to start my period.
29	2	I have been on this birth control for one year exactly and I mainly went on this for my skin but I didn't notice anything different with my acne when I was on it compared to when I didn't take birth control.
29	3	However, since a few days after I began taking reclipsen, I've been running into some issues concerning painful headaches and acne flare ups.
29	4	I've been on Ortho-Tri Cyclen birth control pill in the past, & I do not remember having any issues as far as headaches or acne while I was on that medication.
29	5	My dr told me this bc is good for those with acne but I have had horrible break outs that I can't stop!I forgot to take my pill today and just realized that I haven't experienced any of these symptoms at all!
29	6	Pros- lighter periods, no stomach cramps, no acne, no babies.
29	7	My doctor recommended Reclipsen; she believe it would clear up the little bit of acne that I had on my cheeks and forehead.
29	8	My face also looked swollen, and my acne actually became much worse!
29	9	I get chest acne mid pack, I am nauseous often, especially in the handful of hours following each dose.
29	10	No pregnancy's, no bloating, no emotional freak outs, no depression, no painful periods but on the negative side my acne has stayed the same so it doesn't help much on acne.
29	11	BUT...I am an athlete and this birth control works really well...looking for a new birth control maybe to help with some acne.
29	12	Currently in the process of trying to find a different type of birth control to get rid of the forehead acne
29	13	I had no weight gain, cramping nor acne issues while taking Reclipsen only mood swings and headaches.
29	14	My periods are 4 days on the dot and I don't have any acne or cramping.
29	15	It help controls my acne.
29	16	It also clears up any face/back acne so that my skin is flawless, except I do break out a little during the placebo week.
29	17	I also had mild cramps, tender breasts, and acne.
29	18	Developed cystic acne.
29	19	I've always had mild acne and it did not help it what's so ever.
29	20	This birth control was recommended to me bc I had complained of acne and cramps to my doc, acne is coming in 1-2 weeks prior to my period, just little pimples here and there but more than I'd like.
29	21	For me, I DID make my periods lighter, and helped with severe cramps, and cleared my acne, boobs bigger.
29	22	I switched to Reclipsen from Zovia after 7 years because I was getting outrageous hormonal acne.
29	23	The only things I have experienced are my breasts getting a little larger, a MUCH lighter and shorter period, and improved acne.
29	24	Gained a few pounds & I've noticed some mood swings & hasn't really done anything for my acne.
29	25	Pros: I never became pregnant, I had less frequent and severe cramps and it may have helped with acne although I  started a new regimen around the same time.
29	26	Reduced my libido to absolutely nothing, daily migraines, cystic acne, cramps became worse, I had no emotions, hair loss/lifeless hair, and I gained 8 pounds within one month of starting this birth control.
29	27	The only good thing that came from it i was able to eat again, gained 20 pounds in about 3 months, it cleared my acne and I grew 1 bra size.
29	28	It cleared my skin, and my acne is more controlled that it has been in years.
29	29	I didn't gain weight and it cleared up my acne from the birth control I was taking before.
29	30	Only now that I haven't been taking it have I had acne and weight gain.
29	31	Severe weight gain - 20lbs, worse acne, headaches daily, mood swings, anxiety and starving all of the time!
29	32	It helped with my acne as a teenager, and I've never experienced mood swings.
29	33	I haven't experienced any of the painful cystic acne that I was getting on Ortho Tri-cyclen.
29	34	Weight loss, lighter periods, less severe cramps, no acne (although that was never an issue).
29	35	I always had a short fuse and my acne got worse.
29	36	No acne, no weight gain, no mood swings, no spotting, no cup size enhancements (unfortunately) and a nice 4-5 day window that I know exactly when and how much I'm going to bleed.
29	37	I've never had an issue with weight gain or acne, so that's something to be considered, as well.
29	38	Pros: prevented pregnancy well, shortened period, cleared acne
29	39	It is GREAT at preventing pregnancy, it cleared up my acne, didn't gain any weight, and my breasts got bigger!
29	40	So I had to switch from Caziant to this and the first month was fine but all of a sudden I'm always angry and although I don't break out normally I have acne all over my cheeks and like I've seen with other people I think I might have a yeast or bacteria infection, which I have never had before.
29	41	I have been on Reclipsen for 3 months for terrible periods (I'm 15), and my acne isn't any better then it was before, my periods are just as heavy as before and I've gained 17 pounds.
29	42	It caused severe mood swings, anxiety attacks, weight gain, more acne, strange cravings, always hungry, and didn't help with amount of blood or my cramps.
29	43	I used to have SEVERE cystic acne but this stuff keeps my skin so clear.
29	44	After my first month on this pill, I have had non stop acne on my chin like I have never had before.
29	45	Been on this birth control for 3 weeks and I've had acne on my chin like I haven't had in years and I am constantly starving to the point of sickness as well as extremely fatigued.
29	46	This birth control is wonderful because I never have cramps (I used to have them so bad that I would throw up)  I rarely have acne (I've never had worse than very mild acne before though)  My boobs grew (Big boobs run in my family...)  But it gives me CONSTANT yeast infections(I shower daily, sometimes twice and wear full coverage underwear and this doesn't make a difference!!!).
29	47	It did work as a birth control and did not worsen or help with my slight acne.
29	48	I decided to try Reclipsen for my acne and cramps.
29	49	It regulated and shortened periods- no breasts or weight gain, mild acne improvement.
29	50	This pill has been wonderful for my mild acne and even better for my severe cramps.
29	51	I always feel pressure or bloating in my abdomen area but other than that I haven't gotten any acne or change in mood.
29	52	Plus it caused my acne to come back and get dry skin, no matter how much lotion I used and what I used.
29	53	Some emotional ups and downs the first few months, but amazing help for acne.
29	54	My face has been breaking out more than when I wasn't taking the pill.
29	55	I typically have very clear skin but I started breaking out all over.
29	56	My face is breaking out so bad, and I usually have very good skin.
29	57	I wasn't getting pimples before my period, and I actually liked my skin again, it was amazing!
29	58	I started it to see if it would decrease my flow and cramps.
29	59	My flow and cramps were bad.
29	60	I've been on this pill a total of 2 weeks and I feel nauseous, no appetite, exhausted, stomach cramps, boobs are sore, and weak.
29	61	But this BC has made my cramps severe to the point of near vomitting.
29	62	I've been on Reclipsen for a month for regular birth control, period regulation ,and period cramps.
29	63	I heard you have to take it for more than a month for the cramps to ease up so maybe next month will be better.
29	64	I feel swollen all over especially my face and legs, and lately I have been having pounding head ages not to mention the horrible cramps .
29	65	I've always had painful cramps and trouble sleeping while on my period but this one was by far the worst.
29	66	The first night I started my cramps were extremely painful and I couldn't fall asleep after waking up in the middle of the night for the first two nights.
29	67	However here I am two weeks later bleeding, and having unbearable cramps whereas before I would bleed for 5 days with minor cramps.
29	68	The upsides to this method are that my cycle is regular, and shorter, with lighter flow and almost no cramps, all of which is contrary to what I experience when off the pill.
29	69	I have been taking reclipsen for almost a year now and I have barely any cramps except the day before my period starts and the first day.
29	70	I used to get severe cramps to the point where I was in the hospital so this definitely helped with that.
29	71	I never experienced cramps before and I don't while on this BC either.
29	72	I've been on reclipsen for about 5 months now for terrible cramps.
29	73	Doesn't make the cramps go away completely but for the most part.
29	74	It eliminated almost all cramps that come with my period, and my period is much shorter than before.
29	75	I never had cramps or mood swings - but my periods were extremely irregular and would arrive unexpectedly to ruin my favorite pairs of underwear.
29	76	My periods and cramps were also still seven days and severe.
29	77	On a plus side, my period lasted only 4 days, and only 1 day I had cramps (before Reclipsen, 4 - 5 days of some sort of cramps).
29	78	I was prescribed this birth control due to my agonizing and crippling cramps caused by my period.
29	79	It DOES help with my cramps, but I bleed two times a month, which makes me wonder if it's even worth it.
29	80	It's always on the same day and now my cramps are nearly not as bad as they where before.
29	81	I loved this pill because it really controlled my periods and cramps.
29	82	I had little cramps and lighter periods, but my period wouldn't start until 3 days after taking the sugar pills.
29	83	But I did notice that when I would stand up too fast I would have a slight and short cramp.
29	84	My period the first month was the most painful thing I have ever experienced (more painful than my appendix gluing itself to my internal organs with scar tissue), but my subsequent periods have been mostly painless besides dull cramping.
29	85	I went on Reclipsen due to severe cramping and heavy bleeding during my periods.
29	86	Like I said everyone is different, I've had no bloating, cramping, or weight gain.
29	87	I still have a period for about 5 days/month, along with the awful cramping.
29	88	I never had any spotting.
29	89	For the last year I was spotting everyday.
29	90	I switched to Reclipsen because my other birth control was giving me spotting during the month.
29	91	No spotting so far, but I am going to finish this month and stop taking the pills.
29	92	Since I've been on reclipsen I've been spotting in between periods, which in turn has ruined all of my underwear.
29	93	Not just spotting.
29	94	I've been on this birth control for about 3 months now, I agree that it made my periods much lighter which is nice, only 1-2 days reg period and then light spotting.
29	95	The remaining 3 days is light spotting, if that.
29	96	I switched to this to try to eliminate/reducing spotting from my previous birth control brand.
29	97	I've been spotting daily which is annoying to say the least.
29	98	From the very start everything was going well, I had better skin, no weight gain, when I skipped there was no spotting or anything.
29	99	I gained 5-7 lbs within the first few months (not a big deal to me) and had some irregular spotting.
29	100	I experienced a lot of spotting between periods, and if I forgot to take the pill at the exact same time every day, my period started right away--sometimes just hours later!
29	101	I was using a smaller dose of birth control before Reclipsen and started to spot after two months.
29	102	I know when I will start however bleeding is heavy and I spot for three weeks and I get maybe a week off from spotting/bleeding.
29	103	Also, I had my period (5 days) and then continued to spot for another 7 days.
29	104	From the first day I started using this birth control to the last I spotted every single day.
29	105	I've basically OD on headache medicine.
29	106	( I'm 19 ) btw lol 5'4 if that helps .. Today is my first day on the pill so far I've had crazy sex drive & mile headache .. As a side effect & I'm hungry every 30 mins lol .
29	107	The first few days I had overall body weakness and a bad headache, both which subsided after those days.
29	108	CONS: I get severe migraines to the point where I take over the counter headache relief like candy and still doesn't help, sometimes end up vomiting from the severity of the pain.
29	109	I also had a headache for the first couple of days.
29	110	I have other side effects as well, such as nausea and headaches.
29	111	I changed to reclipsen because my other BC was giving me headaches.
29	112	But that's when the headaches started.
29	113	I have been taking this BC for about 4 months, it was great until the last month when I started getting headaches, quick heartbeats, lose of sleep.
29	114	But I can't put up with the headaches, I'm tired all the time and total loss in sex drive (which is weird because I think about sex all the time).
29	115	I don't tolerate anything well and the first week I was very nauseous, had a few headaches but nothing I couldn't handle.
29	116	I started to notice some extreme headaches within the first week that would not go away no matter what I did.
29	117	I know birth control affects everyone differently I just couldn't deal with the headaches.
29	118	I also did get frequent headaches.
29	119	I developed insane headaches.
29	120	Started this pill and took it at night right before bed, woke up every morning with terrible morning sickness, dizziness, and awful headaches.
29	121	Worsens depression, fatigue, increased appetite, weight gain, bloating, constant mild fever, headaches, unstable mood swings, decrease in sex drive overall but spikes in demand for sex at certain times (unstable).
29	122	I had no problems the first month (no weight gain, no headaches, etc.).
29	123	I've been reading other comments about headaches and I can agree that I have had headaches every other night but they weren't bad.
29	124	I do not like this pill, the first month was bad, I had so many bad headaches every week.
29	125	I have noticed that I have very bad headaches after taking the medication.
29	126	I have never had such intense side effects of taking birth control but I don't know why else I would have such headaches.
29	127	I've had a migraine for 2 days now.
29	128	I have gained a ton of weight in the last 3 months I have been on it, I get super nauseous in the mornings, and I have one extremely bad migraine on the last day of the pills.
29	129	I get at least one horrific migraine before I start my period and I'm super emotional.
29	130	I had severe migraines last week during my period week, even though my period didn't start until a day after the migraine.
29	131	But here are all the issues I've had with it: mood swings, depression, anxiety, emotional instability overall, low sex drive, vaginal dryness & migraines.
29	132	I have been on reclipsen for 3 years now and the only pros for me are that I do have much clearer skin and am not pregnant BUT I have awful migraines multiple times a month so bad that I now have a prescription from my neurologist also have basically NO sex drive which is driving my boyfriend insane.
29	133	I don't know if I can contribute weight gain or migraines to this pill....too many other factors.
29	134	I have had migraines, mood swings, and I have broken out in hives and gotten rashes several times as well.
29	135	I started to get migraines, I'm not sure if it is because of the birth control however.
29	136	I used to get then really bad about a year into taking birth control but now my migraines are less frequent.
29	137	I have suffered some migraines, but nothing some Advil and a small nap can't cure.
29	138	Now that I think about it I did have a lower sex drive.
29	139	I take the pill at the same time every day and it has been effective in preventing pregnancies, however my sex drive is now non-existent whereas before I had an extremely high sex drive.
29	140	Now I'm fat and have zero sex drive.
29	141	I have no sex drive(and TMI but very dry)and I'm a raging bitch most days!
29	142	Also, I have no sex drive anymore so I guess it does it's "job."
29	143	Reclipsen helped that but now I have no sex drive at all which is really annoying.
29	144	My sex drive is very low, and I cry uncontrollably and for no reason.
29	145	Other than that my sex drive is fine, maybe a little lower, but not bad.
29	146	Cons- mood swings, TERRIBLE back pain during period, lower sex drive, no weight gain (if already active).
29	147	I lost my sex drive and felt miserable.
29	148	Sex drive was good before but even better.
29	149	I dont see a change in my mood, weight, or sex drive but I did start to breakout a little on my forehead and chin which I never use to before this pill.
29	150	My sex drive has been almost non-existent while on Reclipsen.
29	151	The biggest con is that it definitely affected my sex drive though, my libido dropped so much that my bf encouraged me to get off Reclipsen, which I did.
29	152	Also, it did not decrease my sex drive in any way.
29	153	And it wasn't until I just tried out a new birth control (Microgestrin for 3 weeks) that I noticed how Reclipsen depleted my sex drive completely.
29	154	I have definitely noticed a decrease in sex drive which has caused some issues.
29	155	These include: Swollen, tender breasts (which I wouldn't mind except for I have fibrocystic breast making even hugging my husband painful), severe fatigue (I thought it might have been the Texas heat but it's gotten worse even since it has cooled down), SUPER decreased sex drive (I guess that's a good form of birth control), and hard to lose any weight!
29	156	For the 3 years I was on it I had ravenous hunger, low blood sugar crashes, low libido, stress, and anxiety.
29	157	It solved that problem, but I had NO libido whatsoever and I was very emotionless.
29	158	My libido decreased dramatically and in addition to that I was constantly dry down there.
29	159	One thing that is confusing however, is I was told that my libido would be decreased with this pill and its been the complete opposite.
29	160	The first thing that I noticed was that my libido was noticeably reduced, (which was a bit annoying,) and my overall emotions were dulled a bit, so that I was more indifferent to things than before.
29	161	I noticed some weight gain but could also be due to other factors.
29	162	My weight has been consistent after the initial weight gain (no new diets or different exercises).
29	163	Pros - still not pregnant, no weight gain.
29	164	I have been on Riclipsen for just about a year and since I've been on it I've experienced weight gain (9 pounds),  mood swings, and very very emotional.
29	165	No weight gain as of yet.
29	166	First I wanna start by saying weight gain depends on you.
29	167	The only good things were that I had no weight gain and my periods were much lighter and one day shorter than without birth control pills.
29	168	And so far I have not noticed any weight gain.
29	169	I haven't noticed any weight gain, in fact I have successfully lost weight on it after making some dietary changes.
29	170	Although it has prevented pregnancy the mood swings and weight gain have been enough for me to finally get rid of it.
29	171	Bloating, headhaches, WEIGHT GAIN!
29	172	No mood changes, no pain, no weight gain so far.
29	173	Cons weight gain, extreme mood swings, longer periods, depression, nausea, increased appetite, frequent yeast infection/bacterial vaginitis combination.
29	174	well I have been on this for probably a year an a half an was on a different one for 2 an ahalf years due to really bad mood swings an got switched to this about a year ago my doc asked about my weight gain an i told her it was from not being active as i was in high school with drill team now im thinking its not that.
29	175	I do have clearer skin and no noticeable weight gain, but I do not regularly check my weight.
29	176	I'm not sure if it is related to the birth control but I have noticed some weight gain which has been hard to control but I have had no breakthrough bleeding and altogether I have been pretty pleased.
29	177	Some people say they've gained weight, but I've lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks, NOT the healthy way.
29	178	I have gained weight but that's probably because I've gotten older.
29	179	I've gained weight get extremely emotional before I start.
29	180	I have gained weight in all the right places and haven't had any horrible side effects.
29	181	All within the first two weeks my appetite went crazy (I am typically a very healthy eater) I've even gained a few pounds, I go to the gym about 4 times a week.
29	182	I gained weight in all the right areas so that was a plus.
29	183	Now I've noticed that I've gained a pound probably because it seems my boobs exploded.
29	184	I also gained 10 pounds in the 5 months I was on it and I work out regularly and eat healthy.
29	185	I was overweight (230) when I started it, and I gained more weight within the past three years (260).
29	186	WORST OF ALL, I gained 20 lbs from Feb-Oct 2015.
29	187	I gained a little weight in high school and college, but this is probably due to many other factors (quitting sports, not exercising, eating poorly, etc.)
29	188	I don't weigh myself but it is obvious I've gained weight as well.
29	189	Now, this month so far I have gained around 2-3 lbs.
29	190	I've been pregnant at least 4 times and I gained about 2-3 lbs.
29	191	I gained ten pounds and then lost about seven.
29	192	I am changing to a different pill because I didn't like how I gained weight on this pill.
29	193	I gained 10 pounds at least, and I've been getting heavier.
29	194	The nausea seemed to occur 2 hrs after taking the pill (I take it at 3pm everyday).
29	195	Since then, I've experienced nausea every single day.
29	196	To this day, each pill I take I experience nausea.
29	197	After the first few days I had pretty bad nausea, so I started taking it at night, that helped.
29	198	I experienced some dizziness and nausea which is to be expected.
29	199	I was very nauseated especially in the mornings.
29	200	I get nauseated in cars if I am not the driver.
29	201	Super nauseous.
29	202	Whenever I go from the placebo week to the actual hormones again, I am excessively nauseous and spend way too much time in the bathroom dry heaving.
29	203	I just started taking this pill this week, so far not that bad of side effects except I'll get nauseous at night usually after I eat.
29	204	Made me nauseous but started taking it at night and that helped .
29	205	I've felt so dizzy and light headed.
29	206	However, about a month ago, I started experiencing horrible mood swings.
29	207	It brought on anxiety and intense mood swings along with depression, I'm finally getting off of it but do not buy this if you already have anxiety!
29	208	Had mood swings, irregular periods etc.
29	209	In the beginning, I noticed episodes of mood swings, but have been managing them pretty well.
29	210	I have been on Reclipsen for 3 weeks, I have been experiencing severe depression, anxiety and mood swings.
29	211	I did notice severe mood swings before my period started, but not sure if that was due to things going on in life or the pill.
29	212	Other than mood swings no negative side effects.
29	213	I first started with Reclipsen a year ago for 2-3 months and experienced extreme mood swings.
29	214	I cry almost every day and my mood swings have caused strain on my relationship.
29	215	I do feel down sometimes, and have mood swings here and there, more of a funk than depressive, taking B complex as a supplement helps.
29	216	I used this birth control for almost a year, but i decided to stop using it because it was causing me to have really bad mood swings, made me feel like a zombie (emotionless).
29	217	I was getting horrible mood swings and getting extremely depressed out of nowhere.
29	218	So if you're getting mood swings and depressed try taking a vitamin B pill with your birth control.
29	219	Another thing I love about Reclipsen is that is levels out my mood and I don't have mood swings like I used to.
29	220	Don't even get me started about my over the top mood swings.
29	221	I lost 15 pounds with no change in activity and my yeast infections and mood swings stopped.
29	222	It also gives me horrible mood swings during my period.
29	223	I will be switching soon... No mood swings either.
29	224	So I have been on Reclipsen for 1 year and 6 months and I started realizing crazy mood swings during the placebo pills (the PMS week) and my mood would be irritable then happy, it was bipolar, I also realized a lot of hair loss (but then again I really have thick hair), I also realized shortness of breath super easily.
29	225	I feel crazy, mood swings changing within the same hour.
29	226	It definitely helped my PMS, but I did experience many mood swings besides that.
29	227	I was so nervous about it that I called my doctor and he told me that I was suffering from synchronized hair loss and that can be a side effect of this medication.
29	228	My doctor switched me to Seasonale, I'm kind of nervous switching.
29	229	I already had depression and anxiety but this greatly exacerbated the issue.
29	230	I do have anxiety, but I don't think I can blame this pill for that, it's kind of just my personality.
29	231	I have been on Reclipsen regularly for about a year now and my depression, anxiety is through the roof.
29	232	I get a weird chest pain sometimes and my anxiety is crazy high.
29	233	I maybe had some breast pain when I started it, but cutting down on caffeine cured that.
29	234	Since then, the only side effects were breast tenderness (around my menstrual cycle) and some moodiness during my period.
29	235	Cons: within the first month of starting I had a yeast infection and over the next 2 years I would have some kind of vaginal or bladder infection every other month.
29	236	I had chronic yeast infections too.
30	1	Only good thing was my acne cleared up.
30	2	Also, about 3 years into taking the pills I started to develop scarring cystic acne that hasn't gone away even after stopping.
30	3	I had cyctic acne all over my face (I used to never break out before this pill) and I lost 20 pounds.
30	4	I have been on it for almost 3 months and I have developed horrible acne all over my chin and side of my cheek.
30	5	It also helped immensely with my cystic acne.
30	6	I haven't had acne for several years now but a couple weeks into taking this pill I did start getting bumps.
30	7	I had one period every 3 months and it helps with mild acne.
30	8	No acne.
30	9	Periods became regular, I had my period for about 5 days which I find healthy in my opinion  since I don't get it for 3 months and has cleared up my face from acne and pimples.
30	10	It seems like it's losing it's strength on me because I'm getting more acne around "that" time.
30	11	I have been on Seasonique for almost 3 months, I haven't had any spotting however really bad acne on my T-zone.
30	12	I am totally attracted to 3-4 menstrual cycles a year, not to the idea of the acne however.
30	13	I have  had  slight  acne, but I wash and use Bentonite  Clay 3 times a week .
30	14	I also get moderate acne around my jawline when I do have my period even though I do not mind it as much since it helps out with my acne when I do not have my period.
30	15	That being said the up side was I didn't have worsening acne, weight gain, headaches, etc.
30	16	Two years later, the acne problem isn't as bad, but my sex drive is still gone and during intercourse I am also dry which makes intercourse uncomfortable.
30	17	I've never had acne before and I exercise so I can only guess its the hormones.
30	18	I also experienced weight gain and acne.
30	19	I Love it because I've Never got pregnant on it And I Suffer from body and Face acne and Seasonique did a GREAT Job on Clearing that up.
30	20	No cramps, no weight gain, no acne, no spotting (unless of course I didn't take it at the same time every day).
30	21	It helped with my bloating, acne and mood swings.
30	22	BUT it gave me the worst acne I've ever had in my whole life.
30	23	Severe cystic acne that ruined my face.
30	24	My acne is semi-normal for my young age.
30	25	I started this birth control because other birth controls were either not working for my acne or giving me bad cramps.
30	26	I was moody all the time, my appetite grew, and it really did nothing for my acne.
30	27	I also had moderate weight gain, intense cravings, moderate issues with acne, and hysterical crying episodes.
30	28	I've notice weight gain (I've been eating the same), more acne (I drink lots of water) and I've been way more emotional since I have been in a long time.
30	29	If one isn't working for you because you feel as though it's giving you worse cramps, acne, etc., try another brand.
30	30	I have not experienced worse acne and my periods are shorter and less painful.
30	31	Remember your life changes- just because your acne got worse doesn't mean it was automatically your birth control.
30	32	I have gotten a little more emotional since being on the pill and have had a small acne issue around my jawline, which I had never had before, but nothing that bad.
30	33	No acne, no weight gain, no abnormal bleeding.
30	34	At first I spotted, cried for no reason, terrible headaches, was very moody, achy, had acne (which I have never had, and I'm almost 20) and was tired but now it's great.
30	35	My acne isn't as bad as it used to be.
30	36	I never had acne ever and when I started the pill I had oily skin and acne.
30	37	Now I have gained 10lbs (that I can't get off), acne (I've never had acne!
30	38	Along with middle acne, and I've been bleeding enough to use a tampon for about ten days.
30	39	My face is now starting to get acne and I have NEVER in my life had acne.
30	40	The only side effect I had was acne.
30	41	I suffered from acne when I was a child and teenager and after having my son, it seemed to clear up.
30	42	While taking the Seasonique my acne returned, but not as bad as previously.
30	43	I've had no break through bleeding, no problems with sex drive, no serious weight gain or acne.
30	44	I've noticed my acne has flared up much more then when I was taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen, but I thought it would clear up.
30	45	In addition I had the pleasure of getting severe cystic acne that I haven't been able to get under control.
30	46	It has given me acne and very painful cramps.
30	47	I've never had acne or even bad pimples and my face started to really break out.
30	48	Slight appetite increase, but no acne or crazy mood swings.
30	49	The only reason I'm switching is because my acne has gotten really bad because of stress.
30	50	As of the last couple of months I've noticed some unexplained weight gain and my face is breaking out.
30	51	The last week I have been breaking out pretty bad and I have had major stomach pains for like 3 days straight.
30	52	But I'm breaking out on my chest and back.
30	53	Then I started breaking out really bad, which for me was never an issue before and I'm 21 years old.
30	54	While it has worked for that & kept my skin clear from the cystic pimples I would occasionally get, it has raised my blood pressure & made me gain at least 15 pounds now over 3 years.
30	55	I have no complaints at all everything with my body is normal, no weight gain, I get some pimples when I have my period like I always have, no different if I'm on a pill or not.
30	56	I then switched back to seasonique and I have been on it for a week and already have had 3 huge zits on my chin and feel extremely moody and bloated.
30	57	I never had cramps or heavy needing until this pill.
30	58	You basically never get your period (so bye bye cramps, bleeding, buying tampons, ruining underwear).
30	59	I have hardly no cramps at all.
30	60	I had a very light period with little to no cramps while on this pill.
30	61	The first time I felt those cramps I dropped to the floor for a bit.
30	62	My periods are less than 5 days and sometimes last only 2-3 days and I have little to no cramps!
30	63	I will give it 2 more weeks, but have severe cramps, so bad that i have left work early, which is why i am on this to begin with.....for heavy bleeding and pain.
30	64	I didn't even experience the horrible cramps I previously did.
30	65	After that the bleeding completely stopped no cramps or nothing no spotting either.
30	66	I've been on this for 2 weeks now and the only side effects I've experienced is very mild nausea, very light spotting and mild cramps.
30	67	I rather just have my period for 5-6 days and have cramping rather than go through with spotting for two weeks with cramps.
30	68	No change in cramps, but as long as they're not worse, I'm okay with it.
30	69	Also no cramps.
30	70	I have a few cramps but nothing compare to before.
30	71	No more heavy periods, cramps, mood swings, or missed work.
30	72	I'm also having the same severity, if not more, of cramps that I had before I started.
30	73	While on Seasonique I didn't notice the changes my body went through until I started doing some research , I loved only having one period every 3 months but the periods were painful bad cramps, lower back pain the first 2 days, the first 4 months were fine, then I started a month and a half long period but I stuck it out hoping it would be better, then things were going good until I started bleeding during intercourse, I went to see my doctor and she told me it was probably caused by the birth control, also since I started taking it I would get the sensation that I would faint, and I have fainted once while on it, had a little weight gain, it really messed up my hormones, guess my body didn't like it!
30	74	I have always had awful cramps and mood swings, and the Seasonique doesn't help much with those, but it's not so bad when it's only 4 times a year.
30	75	On the bright side, my horrible cramps have disappeared and my period only lasts a couple of days, although they have been somewhat heavy.
30	76	About a week after starting this pill I started getting extreme cramps, the worst I've ever had, they would last 2-8 hours a day and no medicine would relieve the pain.
30	77	I have stomach cramps so bad I can't move sometimes.
30	78	Woke up the next day and started crying hysterically and had the worst cramps in the world.
30	79	I thought I was pregnant because of the cramps but looking at the reviews I'm not the only one.
30	80	I recently started to have a light breakthrough bleeding and cramps (which I had almost NEVER gotten before).
30	81	I started reading all the reviews because I was worried about my bleeding and cramps.
30	82	I am now on my period with the worst cramps I've ever had, they started at least 2 days before my actual period and I feel like I have bipolar disorder.
30	83	After one year, I finally became regular, but then I had many muscle spasms, mood swings, cramps, mild headaches, and a TOTAL LACK OF MY SEX DRIVE and no lubrication during sex.
30	84	My periods always last 3 to 4 days with no excessive bleeding, but the past 2 periods I have had cramps for the first time I have been on it, not severe and they go away fast, but they are still there.
30	85	I had really bad cramps and spotting for the first 8 to 9 months on Seasonique.
30	86	I continued to have intermittent cramps and spotting after.
30	87	I no longer have the 7-10 day periods and my periods are very light and there are no cramps.
30	88	When I started bleeding the cramps were worse than ever before (part of the reason I began taking Seasonique was to lessen the pain and cramping associated with my cycle).
30	89	It is the heaviest it has ever been and I have extreme cramps so I will change my pill.
30	90	The cramps and bleeding have been heavier/worse than I've ever had.
30	91	It's morning time and I feel cramps and bloated.
30	92	My cramps are definitely not making things any better.
30	93	The cramps that accompanied my period were terrible.
30	94	Also, I don't know if my body got immune to the birth contrl but after a while, my heavy periods came back as well as the cramps.
30	95	My lower back and my stomach cramp up I get bad headaches and I am tired all the time.
30	96	I am on just Day 2 and I cramp and feel nauseated.
30	97	Lastly, I constantly have this cramp that feels like the ones you get a few days before you start your period.
30	98	Now that I'm in the second month, however, I have begun cramping on top of the discharging.
30	99	Sort of scary when you look up "cramping on the pill" and all the links have the title "signs of early pregnancy" :/
30	100	When I first started this birth control I had mild nausea and light cramping.
30	101	I have taken it regularly daily and have bled for nearly three weeks with awful cramping.
30	102	However, for the first two months I had irregular spotting and cramping.
30	103	One con I did notice is slight cramping around the times I used to get my period, other then this the birth control is amazing.
30	104	If I'm not careful to take them at around the same time, I will get cramping and sometimes spotting.
30	105	Halfway through week 5 I experienced awful cramping, bloating, constipation, and headaches, hopefully they will go away!
30	106	But this second time around has been alright other than the slight pressure cramping often happening.
30	107	The only things that I've experienced are a little bit of cramping around the time I would normally have a period, but nothing too bad.
30	108	I started Seasonique to cut down on periods, cramping and help with PMS.
30	109	The bleeding (light) and cramping (mild) began the 2nd week I started Seasonique.
30	110	One strange side effect is that after an orgasm I would have a terrible cramping and blood a little later.
30	111	My periods are much shorter and I have less severe cramping.
30	112	Random cramping.
30	113	The only change I did have was prior to Seasonique I never cramped with any of my periods and while on the pill I had moderate/severe cramping for the first few days of all my periods.
30	114	My side effects: weight gain of 6+ lbs in one month, breast tenderness, constipation accompanied by gas and bloating, lethargy spanning from feeling "run-down" to complete exhaustion where I slept for 19 hours, extremely painful cramping with diarrhea.
30	115	The cramping has been debilitating for 4 days now and is only mildly relieved with Pamprin.
30	116	I have been taking Seasonique for about 4 weeks and have been experiencing some bleeding for about 7 days now with some cramping.
30	117	I liked it for the first couple of months but I noticed some not normal spotting for two weeks that basically was my period.
30	118	I would take it have the heavy spotting and then period and after the period it would be back to heavy spotting.
30	119	My first two months on it were not really good - I had constant spotting since 2 weeks from start, and I was quite moody and sensitive.
30	120	After that "period" spotting never returned, box is finished, moodiness is gone, skin still clear and my scheduled period was completely painless for first time in my life.
30	121	I had to stop taking this for a little bit because I was spotting.
30	122	I stopped this birth control 2 days ago all the symptoms aside from the spotting are gone.
30	123	For two months I am period free then about mid way through the third month I start spotting until I start my new pack.
30	124	I took this BC for about 5 years it was absolutely amazing for the first four years, with the exception of having spotting here or there but once we got through about 3-6 months that ended and only getting my period ever three months was AMAZING!
30	125	I had no bleeding or spotting when first taking this.
30	126	Had some spotting for the fist six months and then it tapered off.
30	127	Worked great for about a year but then started getting random spotting that lasted for 3 weeks.
30	128	I take my pill at the same time every day and have never had any spotting at all.
30	129	If you start spotting, stop taking the pill and have a period!
30	130	I have been taking this for 10 years and I take it at the same time and still have spotting, but that's just when happens when you try to tell your body to stop a natural process.
30	131	It stopped my period for three months without any spotting until it was finally due.
30	132	It took my body over 6 months to finally adjust to this pill and stop spotting.
30	133	If you want constant spotting to bleeding..depression and hair loss...this will do it!
30	134	I've been on seasonique for years and I've never had a problem, some occasional spotting.
30	135	For the first six months I had non-stop spotting which made sex embarrasing.
30	136	But I have endometreosis and thought having no pain outweighed the spotting.
30	137	The bleeding went from spotting to the point where clots the size of my fist were coming out.
30	138	I'm about to go into my third pack in about a week and a half and I've a some light spotting, but nothing to be alarmed about.
30	139	During the last week or 2 before the yellow pills or "period pills" I get constant on and off spotting.
30	140	I have been spotting for two weeks.
30	141	I'm spotting almost every day and I am trying to take it in the morning at every same time between 0700-0900.
30	142	I've never had any spotting between periods and sometimes I skip 2 quarters, meaning I have 2 periods a year.
30	143	I had been spotting every day since I started using it and I had a full blown period 2 weeks after starting using it.
30	144	I love the fact I only get your period every 3 month but  the spotting is not much better.
30	145	so my spotting it's not cause by missing doses or taking it at different times
30	146	I have never had the spotting that other people have talked about.
30	147	I've  heard  of excessive  spotting , you  have  to  take  it at the  same  time  every  day .
30	148	If the spotting doesn't stop within a few days,  I stop taking the pack for a week and have a period and then start the pack again.
30	149	I tried Seasonique 3 month supply for birth control & also to control my period's, for the first month I had no period then all of a sudden I bled for three months (full periods not just spotting).
30	150	Having a period four times a year is AMAZING, and I have absolutely no spotting in between.
30	151	I have been taking Seasonique pretty much since it first came out about 7 years ago, and I've never had any spotting or negative side effects at all.
30	152	Just some occassional light spotting so far.
30	153	I get spotting twice a month sometimes.
30	154	I had migraines during the first pack and some spotting and slightly off discharge.
30	155	I've had no problems with this pill except the occasional spotting.
30	156	I never had any problems with spotting or heavy periods at all.
30	157	I had no spotting during these 3 months or any period signs.
30	158	While I was warned about breakthrough bleeding and spotting between periods, I was not warned that it was possible to have nonstop periods.
30	159	After that, my mood got back to normal, but I still have spotting from time to time.
30	160	I have had very little spotting, barely noticeable.
30	161	Anyone who is concerned about spotting and immediately switches is just being impatient.
30	162	You WILL have spotting for the 1st 2-3 cycles, but it will go away!
30	163	I tend to have spotting for two to three weeks at a time during the active pills, even when I take them at EXACTLY the same time everyday.
30	164	I had some light spotting the first month or two but I have had no problem since.
30	165	However, the week that my period was expected, week 4, I had only light spotting.
30	166	Still light spotting...but I'm optimistic so far.
30	167	The first month and a half it was perfect, then I missed it for three days when I misplaced it and began spotting.
30	168	Just take them on time everyday and DO NOT miss a pill or you will start spotting.
30	169	She told me to do this in order to reduce any spotting.
30	170	I think that method may work because I haven't had any spotting at all.
30	171	That also helps reduce spotting.
30	172	I have been spotting and having break through bleeding.
30	173	I do have some spotting in the middle of the three months but its only like a weekish at the most but overall I think its better then having 12 periods a year.
30	174	There is SOME spotting but its okay.
30	175	I'm on week 7 and in the last week noticed a tiny bit of spotting, not enough to use a tampon or even a liner.
30	176	I haven't had any symptoms other then some spotting that happened once.
30	177	My spotting went away for a day but came right back.
30	178	I have been using Seasonique for 2 years now and after the first year I have had no problems other than some spotting when I forget to take the pill on time.
30	179	For about the first five weeks, it was fine and I didn't have a period or spotting.
30	180	The first month and a half on Seasonique is great but then the spotting starts.
30	181	I had no spotting or bleeding during the 3 months I took it.
30	182	I never had spotting or breakthrough bleeding during the 3 months of active pills.
30	183	The first year and a half was great - would spot at about 7 weeks - but no other obvious signs of concern.
30	184	I would spot for weeks until stopping so I Would get my period.
30	185	It actually cleared my skin while I do have an occasional spot.
30	186	I rarely ever spot, my skin has not changed, my weight has not changed, and neither has my hair.
30	187	My experience with this pill is 50/50...I love only having my period every 3 months but I spotted for months when I started, have lots of headaches, my breasts are bigger and I gained weight.
30	188	Do not be turned off by people saying they bled or spotted for weeks or months - this is only because it must be started at a specific point in your cycle.
30	189	I love taking seasonique, I spotted on and off for the first three months after starting this birth control pill and after that I never had an issue with it.
30	190	I've  been  on it for 2 months , I spotted  on and  off  for the  first  3 weeks .
30	191	It's been 2 years, I spotted for almost six weeks straight on the first pack until I had the first period.
30	192	I never spotted in between periods or had any other problems.
30	193	Like Most women today, irregular periods are a headache ..... so I talked to my doctor about birth control options and we decided to try Teva aka Seasonique.... worst decisions I have made regarding medication.
30	194	Sometimes I get my 2-day headache from hell right before my period, sometimes I can avoid it.
30	195	Zero headaches and lighter periods.
30	196	My only problem is the headaches!
30	197	I have bad mood swings , headaches, and now my period comes before I even start the last month.
30	198	They were horrendous vision-impairing headaches.
30	199	I don't get headaches, backaches or many other side effects.
30	200	I started getting headaches every day.
30	201	It has also been accompanied by severe headaches.
30	202	I also get very bad headaches.
30	203	I haven't had any weight gain yet, however, have headaches almost everyday.
30	204	I'm going to take it until the end of pack one, but being 22 with a 6 month old, attending school full time I can't handle the bleeding, headaches, and exhaustion, if they continue!
30	205	And I just had my first migraine today.
30	206	I always got migraine after stepping off the active pills, triggered by the pre-period hormone dip.
30	207	I was on seasonique for two years - as a suffered with severe migraines all my life, with worsened episodes around my period this was the ideal birth control for me.
30	208	I have suffered from incredibly awful menstrual migraines while on the "inactive" break pills with every brand of birth control, for years.
30	209	Spotting consistently, very moody- ready to take my boyfriends head off for no reason, migraines that make it hard to function and fatigue from another world !
30	210	I do suffer from migraines; however, I had migraines even when I wasn't taking Seasonique so I don't think the two are connected.
30	211	This pill was prescribed to me because I get menstrual migraines.
30	212	Seriously considering ditching this medication & just dealing with the migraines another way.
30	213	Really like this for my migraines right now too has helped quite a bit for them as well.
30	214	The hormone fluctuations are still pretty obvious to my body because I still get migraines.
30	215	I have suffered from migraines for a long time, especially around my period, and on these pills they have decreased.
30	216	I have gained about 10 pounds, but I don't really mind the weight gain with having no period, no migraines and a free increase in breast size.
30	217	Seasonique literally keeps me from missing work due to migraines.
30	218	I had migraines at least once a week, I bled for a month straight during my second pack, I had breakouts periodically that I didn't get before, my heart raced consistently (at least 3-4 times per week) and I gained 40 lbs in the past two years.
30	219	I also don't have as many migraines as I used to.
30	220	I gained 40 pounds, had zero sex drive.
30	221	I was depressed and had no energy or sex drive as well.
30	222	Absolutely no sex drive, which puts strain on the relationship.
30	223	Also your sex drive will hit rock bottom.
30	224	Although I  loved the fact that this drug allowed me to have fewer periods, however the affect it had extreme mood swings, decrease sex drive, my personailty and my appetite was astronomical.
30	225	I also completely lost my sex drive before stopping using this and have now stopped taking it and I am honestly scared to experiment with new pills
30	226	It's birth control and I feel with every birth control I have had, I have similar side effects - low sex drive, about 10 pounds weight gain that WILL NOT go away (workout 6 days a week & eat paleo).
30	227	I have also lost all my sex drive!
30	228	Also I have zero sex drive.
30	229	My sex drive was normal, but wasn't there cause all I would do was bleed heavily.
30	230	When I first started using it nothing major really changed with my body, but after the first couple of months I started to break out more often and my sex drive was practically non-existent.
30	231	No loss of sex drive at all.
30	232	Only thing I noticed was I lost my sex drive.
30	233	I think my sex drive went down its been six weeks and haven't had the urge but I like the pill other than that.
30	234	One month two weeks to be exact, and it has also taken my sex drive away completely.
30	235	When dealing with hormones I know my body will be altered in someway but pity about my sex drive.
30	236	My sex drive did go down a bit in the first couple of months, but then I was back to normal.
30	237	Sex drive is non-existent for a few weeks at a time.
30	238	One more complication is that I have a very decreased sex drive, but that's not a very big deal for me but may be for other women.
30	239	Plus sex drive plummeted.
30	240	My sex drive was not lost at all.
30	241	However I literally feel as though I have become an asexual due to my VERY little sex drive, which at 22, should be kicking.
30	242	I love this pill although I haven't been on it very long, I have noticed my increased sex drive with my husband.
30	243	NO sex drive at all, thought it was me, but after reading multitude of other comments, it wasn't.
30	244	But who could get pregnant when your mood swings are off the charts and you have absolutely NO sex drive, and even if I tried to be interested, it wouldn't be worth it because it's too dry.
30	245	I've been on Seasonique for almost 2 years now - it has drastically reduced my sex drive but I thought the convenience of the 4 periods per year was worth it.
30	246	I also experienced a very, very low sex drive for the first month and a half I was on this pill.
30	247	Also, ever since I started taking it, my libido is really low and I simply have no sex drive.
30	248	For 2 years I had no libido, no desire to do anything other than sit on my couch.
30	249	Also, my libido dropped like crazy, I was not interested in sex at all, but I wanted to be.
30	250	I have been on this pill for close to 5 years if not longer and I have had no bad experiences other than a little weight gain (about 10lbs) but that is to be expected.
30	251	I began taking this my freshman year of college (did gain the freshman 15- well, 17) but I assumed the weight gain was due to stress and eating Taco Bell and drinking.
30	252	We still haven't decided to try, but with taking Seasonique, I have had zero weight gain, zero Hormone change....no side effects what so ever.
30	253	I am a vegetarian and work out at least an hour a day so I know the weight gain was not due to my lifestyle.
30	254	My breast size increased close to a full cup size and I didn't have much weight gain.
30	255	As for weight gain, I gained 5 pounds and on a girl who's 5'1 it looks like a lot.
30	256	The only downfall I've found so far is weight gain, around 5-10 pounds, which doesn't seem like much but to a smaller person it makes a huge difference in clothes fitting.
30	257	In the time I was on it my face started to break out and I gained about 40 lbs.
30	258	I also gained 18lbs on this pill.
30	259	I had mood swings, depression, gained about 40 pounds, and had constant discharge.
30	260	Since then I've gained 10 pounds, I'm tired, nauseous, and bloated all the time.
30	261	However I recently decided to stop taking birth control as I have not been sexually active and do not plan to be anytime soon and since I stopped taking this is in April 2015 I have gained 15 pounds regardless of working out 5x a week and limiting my diet and my diet has only improved over the last five years.
30	262	With those negatives out of the way, I can say that I haven't gained any weight and as long as I don't forget, it does a pretty good job of keeping me on the 90 day schedule.
30	263	I gained about 10 lbs but most of it was in my chest.
30	264	On the NEGATIVE side....I have gained close to 20 pounds in the last 4 months since I started taking Seasonique and have not been able to drop the weight with diet and exercise.
30	265	I gained about 5 lbs on it.
30	266	But I've gained about 8 pounds since I started it.
30	267	I've gained 15 pounds in about 3 months and I feel disgusting.
30	268	During that period of time, I gained about 15 pounds, experienced horrible irritability, and I bled so much I was practically on my period for 3 months.
30	269	I'm not a big girl in the first place but this pill got me down to 90 pounds because of the severe nausea.
30	270	So far, I have had no irregular bleeding and very little nausea.
30	271	This drug gives me no nausea whatsoever, and I have an extremely sensitive stomach.
30	272	I have experienced nausea and alot of fatigue.
30	273	Being tired with nausea does make me nervous with this new birth control.
30	274	I had to miss a day of work due to the nausea.
30	275	Plus the nausea was so overwhelming.
30	276	When I switched to Seasonique, I experienced some nausea which was normal.
30	277	If you push through the first year of nausea, mood swings, and some dryness during sex, it mulls over and the pill really is great once your body is adjusted.
30	278	Almost immediately I got extremely exhausted, nauseous, fluctuating body temperatures, overwhelming sadness, a heavy feeling in my chest, and on the third day I had a panic attack at work so I decided to stop taking it.
30	279	This birth control makes me incredibly nauseous.
30	280	I also take it with food and I am still nauseous.
30	281	I started having a dizzy feeling last week.
30	282	I haven't had any breakthrough bleeding or any other problems but the dizziness is preventing me from having a normal life.
30	283	Mood swings.
30	284	No mood swings, no break through bleeding, period always on time, smooth sailing..
30	285	I have had an increase in appetite as well, and small mood swings.
30	286	Once I got to the second pack I have had horrible mood swings and I just will start crying for no reason.
30	287	I may have fallen victim to a couple of mood swings at the beginning, BUT I've always been a moody female so I don't think anyone knew the difference.
30	288	The mood swings are almost unbearable and I've been getting my period even when I'm taking the active pills.
30	289	My last 2 birth control pills gave me insane mood swings.
30	290	I’ve never had problems with BC in my life so didn’t correlate my crippling anxiety (never had before in my life), exhaustion, and depression to this medicine.
30	291	I thought the crippling exhaustion, anger, anxiety and depression were from being a working mom of a young child.
30	292	The first few months I had some problems but eventually got on some anxiety medicine and been fine ever since!
30	293	After a few days I noticed right away that my anxiety got really bad.
30	294	I went back on the pill for postpartum depression and its calmed my anxiety.
30	295	Helped with my depression and anxiety, which was a God send.
30	296	My anxiety is super bad.
30	297	My only side effect now after 1 pack is breast tenderness which isn't the worst but feels like I got a boob job.
30	298	I've been on this pill for 4 1/2 months and for the first three months everything was fine besides the bleeding and breast tenderness, I started months 4 everything was perfect!
30	299	No more heavy periods and Breast tenderness was gone.
30	300	Severe yeast infections after the “period week”, bleeding heavier than a regular period for six weeks straight.
31	1	Now I have never had acne in my life but since having it inserted my face is horrible!!
31	2	Also my skin was the type that I would get acne once a year (not kidding).
31	3	I have so many acne scars now.
31	4	I was also fatigued and experiencing breakouts of acne and hair thinning that I had never experienced in my life.
31	5	In just a month, I have experience weight gain, acne, facial hair growth, severely oily skin, severe anxiety, vertigo, nausea, depressed mood, irritability, and more.
31	6	No change in weight or acne and my boyfriend has finished inside of me and I’m not pregnant this birth-control is great I recommend it to everybody.
31	7	I noticed the more long-term side effects I️ experienced with Skyla around the 6th month- which were fatigue, weight gain, acne, irritability, and mood swings.
31	8	The acne is mild, but the weight gain, irritability and mood swings were more significant.
31	9	Now I'm having increased acne when I never had acne in my teens, I'm getting horrible cramps out of no where, it feels like someone is ripping my hip bones out of my body.
31	10	Plus, every other birth control I've tried has given me horrible moods swings, horribly tender breasts, and acne.
31	11	Skyla also caused me to have terrible acne.
31	12	In those four weeks, I've had a constant, heavy period, cramps, migraines, bloating, moodiness, worsened acne, and overall tiredness.
31	13	I'm not saying I didn't have acne or was never tired before, but the last four weeks have made me not want to leave the house.
31	14	Haven't gained weight or had acne appear since getting skyla.
31	15	So happy with it and acne a bit more but no horrible side effects and it's been wonderful to know I'm not going to get pregnant unplanned again.
31	16	Cons I got super depressed the first 3 months of being on it, I never had acne until now and it’s embarrassing it’s cystic acne and I have acne scars and no acne meds help, I have my period on an off for 2 weeks out of the month, I snap a lot at my husband, hair loss the first 4 months on it, and now I have intense back pain to the point I can’t sit or stand.
31	17	My acne cleared up (I assume that was caused by my BC pills).
31	18	Light periods, minimal cramping, no acne (I also don't have acne), no weight changes.
31	19	The cystic acne comes at all times of the month.
31	20	I have noticed acne pick up, no weight gain.
31	21	I am a person who has struggled with horrible mood swings, cystic acne, heavy crampy periods, and no luck with any other BC and I have tried nearly all of them in the 11 years I have been on BC.
31	22	Skyla is the first time in my 27 years that I am acne free, without mood swings, and the happiest and healthiest I have ever been using any form of hormonal birth control!
31	23	Also the weight gain, the nausea, irregular periods, cystic acne breakouts on my face....seriously I hate this thing!
31	24	It was constant spotting, my acne got worse, gained like 15 pounds, headaches, and fatigue.
31	25	Mild acne and cramps, bloating and some constipation.
31	26	I'm CONSTANTLY irritated and emotional, I get acne more than ever, and the constant spotting is becoming annoying.
31	27	Also, my acne is horrible..to the point of me almost crying and always wearing tons of makeup.
31	28	Additionally, I experienced weight gain and acne.
31	29	Might have had my period a few extra days but my flow was lighter-normal, no acne, no mood swing, no bloat.
31	30	My acne has gotten much worse, and I am having PMS symptoms I haven't had since my teenage years (before I started the pill).
31	31	I cannot be on the combined pill due to the migraines with aura (visual changes) I get and I struggle with acne so the POP pill is not for me.
31	32	I used to struggle with acne and now my skin is always clear.
31	33	I had the Mirena IUD several years ago and hated it (sex was painful and I would bleed after every time, I got reoccurring BV infections, acne, etc.
31	34	One negative effect is the acne.
31	35	Now, I have minor acne on my face.
31	36	Just worried about gaining weight or acne.
31	37	I am also losing weight since gaining almost 15 lbs in the 3 months I was on skyla, and my acne is under control again and I am no longer depressed.
31	38	I've always struggled with acne so that hasn't improved but hasn't significantly worsened so that seems like a wash.
31	39	I've gained a little weight and have some acne on my back (before I had neither of these) but, skyla works considering I am not pregnant.
31	40	With others I had major weight gain, face acne, and migraines.
31	41	I didn't get acne or gain weight.
31	42	My acne was terrible and I gained unnecessary weight.
31	43	Let me preface this review by I did already get hormonal acne around my chin/mouth, but it was only when I was experiencing PMS.
31	44	Super painful cystic acne in my chin and some along my jawline and forehead.
31	45	I've have been exercising and eating clean not having a hard time losing weight, no PMSing, no acne, and emotionally normal.
31	46	I have developed some back acne which is annoying, but not a deal breaker.
31	47	I got the worst acne and cramps of my life.
31	48	I took it out still tho because the mood swings and acne were horrible.
31	49	About 7 months into having my skyla I have developed extremely bad cystic acne, to the point where I can see the scars becoming holes on my cheeks.
31	50	For me, that has been the only downside and is making me contemplate removing it, as cystic acne scarring is permanent.
31	51	So far I have a face full of acne ( which I have not had since I was 15: 25 now ) I have also gained 7 pounds .
31	52	In addition to the hair loss I also noticed an increase in acne which had never been a problem for me.
31	53	23 y.o - Gave me cystic acne down my spine (that I never had) that took 6-7 months to resolve, horrible cramps, a cyst on my right ovary, and made sex painful.
31	54	I'm 25 and have acne for the first time ever.
31	55	No cramps, no headaches, tiny mood swings, a little acne but nothing a face wash can't fix.
31	56	I suffer from acne, migraines, and depression very bad and also have had problems with weight gain and decreased sex drive with other birth controls.
31	57	Now my sex drive is great and my acne is better!
31	58	Also, it caused my skin to become very oily and I developed cystic acne.
31	59	I never had an issue with acne until I started Skyla.
31	60	All of my periods are 1.5 weeks long, and I have bad acne now.
31	61	I experienced no weight gain, as many women fear...and already had acne and skin problems prior.
31	62	Also re:acne I've noticed my face is more sensitive to acne then it used to be but if drink more water wear less makeup etc it's fine.
31	63	I believe this has helped with my acne but I still breakout majorly when it's that time.
31	64	If you do not mind having severe acne it definitely does it's job and prevents pregnancy 100% if put in correctly, Occasionally my partner can feel the strings,as well.
31	65	Overall,if you do not wish to have children whatsoever and do not mind having acne,I believe this would be a go-to birthcontrol!
31	66	I break out now with bad acne.
31	67	Sex drive & acne haven't been affected.
31	68	(4 months with the skyla inserted) I'm feeling better than ever.. some acne, but any kind of birth control will cause that.. my appetite incresed, but I allowed it, so I can't blame it on the Skyla.. hoping for no babies & no periods for the next 3 years
31	69	There was some heavy cramping and I was bleeding/spotting for the next two months or so but since then my periods have been light if I have them at all my acne has almost completely cleared up.
31	70	The only complaints that I have are the terrible acne and the difficulty I have had losing weight.
31	71	I'm writing my experience due to the fact when I was researching skyla I couldn't find very many reviews....my experience wasn't horrible yet wasn't the best I decided to get skyla in Oct of 2014 it was newly out I decided on it rather then mirena since skyla was lower dosed and smaller I haven't had any kids initially the insertion did hurt but wouldn't say excruciating Dr wrote for a valium before hand so that helped I'm sure after insertion felt fine went to work didn't have any crazy cramps or bleeding all was good up until about 4 months in I started getting crazy cystic acne on my face and back never had acne before and started getting really bad sharp pains here and there so I waited skyla out for about 7 months then had it removed
31	72	Terrible acne, abdominal swellings, and feeling very isolated and depressed.
31	73	No weight gain, no mood swings, no sudden acne so so far so good.
31	74	I immediately felt better afterwards, bye bye acne, weight gain, and depression!
31	75	I've lost a decent amount of weight since getting off Aubra to be put on Skyla, I am getting some acne though.
31	76	Also hoping I don't gain weight or get acne.
31	77	But now I am having bad cystic acne, I've gained 12 pounds since being on it, and bad itchy bacteria infections "down there".
31	78	I have severe cystic acne EVERYWHERE (even tho I never have), crazy bad cramps, insane mood swings, and weight gain.
31	79	Hair loss, weight gain, acne, depression, mood swings, dry skin, bloating, no sex drive..
31	80	My acne is worse now then it ever was in high school, but then again I was on oral contraceptives that whole time.
31	81	I am also nervous about the risks- perforation, pelvic infection, bacterial vaginosis, hair loss, weight gain, moodiness, acne, etc.
31	82	Also my acne is a lot better, and my weight hasn't changed much tho, although I wish I didn't have an appetite so I could lose more weight!
31	83	I had it in for 6 months and had 2 periods a month, dibilitating cramps that made me cry from pain, mood issues, suicidal thoughts, terrible acne, and 20 pounds of weight gain to name a few.
31	84	), I feel way happier, I have light periods, I haven't gained any weight, I don't have crazy acne, and I never notice it!
31	85	Then I switched to the pill for several more years, towards the end I had regular once a month periods with controlled weight and no acne but excruciating breast and head pains.
31	86	No breast pain yet, but I have experienced acne and weight gain.
31	87	Very effective birth control , easy ,sometimes no periods , no acne ( depends on the person I guess ) .
31	88	(continue) I get a feeling like my poor uterus is being stabbed , also horrible back pain, gained so much weight horrible acne and even more discharge like white stuff inside my vagina ( I never had that in my life) it grosses me out .
31	89	No weight gain to speak of and no additional acne.
31	90	I've never had acne before and now my face breaks out all the time.
31	91	I have been having acne face/back.
31	92	I have also gotten acne which I have never had before.
31	93	It caused my periods to stop, tired all the time, some mood swings, acne and cramps.
31	94	Worst part we're the cramps/the cystic acne, as time went by these worsened.
31	95	I've noticed a little bit of an increase in acne but nothing to want to get it removed because of.
31	96	The only down falls I've noticed are the constant bleeding, I've bled every day since insertion and I've noticed some acne on my face, back and chest area.
31	97	I've lost weight, acne cleared up, & most importantly I'm not moody all the time !
31	98	I've been having dizzy/fainting spells, headaches, back pain, sore breasts, bad acne, plus many UTI's since then.
31	99	Other than the terrible acne, you never know its there
31	100	I get severe migraines with birth control, and I also would suffer from acne, as well as mood swings.
31	101	I do not have any mood swings, no acne, no weight gain, same high libido I had before I was on Skyla.
31	102	I've gained a lot of weight with this IUD and my acne has gotten a lot worse.
31	103	I also have terrible acne, excessive facial hair, lack of sex drive and major depression.
31	104	Since getting the skyla, I've had three ovarian cysts rupture, tons of acne, hair growth in places I've never had hair, and bleeding 15 out of 30 days a month.
31	105	Never had acne before until now, very frustrating.
31	106	Trying to come up with a solution to the acne, if all goes well, I really won't have anything else to complain about Skyla.
31	107	I have had my period now for two weeks at a time every two weeks which is killing my sex life with my boyfriend and my pockets on the amount of tampons I am purchasing my acne is still the same I'm always bloated  and I'm shedding so much and have gained a ton of weight I wanted to at least try to give it a year to see if things were going to change but it's just so agrivating I know some love the skyla but it's not for me.
31	108	Extreme fatigue, headaches almost everyday, and extreme acne inclusive of some cystic acne everywhere.
31	109	I wanted an IUD because I'm terrible at taking pills, the nuvaring always fell out, and my acne was so sensitive to any hormones.
31	110	My acne nearly disappeared, I don't have to pay for BC pills or condoms all the time, and I practically don't have a period anymore.
31	111	I dealt with cystic acne during my cycle.
31	112	No acne.
31	113	But the thing that I didn't like was that I gained 15 lbs, started getting acne which I've never had a problem with.
31	114	I have had a slight change in moodiness (uncontrollable anger/sadness) and my shoulders and lower back is now covered in acne!
31	115	Like all BCs, initially you xp  the hormonal flux with acne & side effects.
31	116	Side effects are acne, gained 15lbs, moody and no cramping.
31	117	My skin has also cleared from acne.
31	118	I was prepared for cramping and bleeding, but I also started getting terrible cystic acne, and my breasts would painfully swell (one at a time) two cup sizes.
31	119	I've always struggled with acne and from reading some reviews seems as if Skyla might make it worse :( My fingers are crossed that it will actually help it!
31	120	It's been about a month and I've noticed a few side effects: occasional terrrrrible cramps & my acne got worse-- however, both of those side effects could potentially have been from me going off of my OCPs and have nothing to do with Skyla, but who knows.
31	121	The only reason for a 9/10 is I believe I may have developed slightly more acne.
31	122	It's hard to tell since I had acne before though.
31	123	I unfortunately am one of the unlucky percentage that ended up with the acne side effect which is really irritating.
31	124	I began breaking out on my chin and neck area as well as becoming extremely moody and irritable.
31	125	Not only was I breaking out but it was also painful to have sex
31	126	I had more cramping and breaking out than normal.
31	127	I've been breaking out.
31	128	My face is constantly breaking out and I also get it on my back and behind (all new).
31	129	I've gained 10ish pounds and my skin is breaking out, but that could be unrelated as I am stressed out right now!
31	130	Now I'm back to normal but only down side is, I've been breaking out, bad, on my jaw area especially.
31	131	I'm barely breaking out, although I broke out a little more when I first got it inserted.
31	132	I began with an exaggeration of hair loss...I just had my son 3 months ago and thought it was related to the post partum but then I began to notice weird pimples appearing!
31	133	I googled the symptoms of these new weird pimples and guess what?
31	134	I've also gained 20lbs in the first 4 months and noticed more zits, anxiety, and my hormones are crazy.
31	135	I had the worst cramps in my life for 2 months and bled consistently until almost 6 months.
31	136	I now rarely ever have cramps, periods are light and shorter!
31	137	Today I've experienced light cramps and spotting, but according to my calender I should be ovulating this week, so maybe they're it's related?
31	138	My periods are incredibly lighter and the 3 days of cramps before I got my period has gone down to about 1/2 a day.
31	139	The doctor explained to me that I would experience some pain consistent with period cramps, so I thought okay no big deal, piece of cake.
31	140	When she actually inserted the IUD I immediately felt cramps but they weren’t unbearable.
31	141	For the next 3-4 months, each time I had my period, my cramps were extremely painful.
31	142	I have pretty moderate menstral cramps, so I found the insertion to be a mild version of what I’m used to.
31	143	After my procedure, I had off and on cramps throughout the day, but nothing too unbearable.
31	144	The first month with a period hurt the cramps were a little more intense.
31	145	I had severe cramps not only on my period but randomly.
31	146	Jaw pain, migraines, vertigo and nausea, cramps, exhaustion, confusion, and unpredictable histamine reactions among other things.
31	147	I experienced the worst period cramps of my life.
31	148	I have had cramps and spotting on random days but I’ve been taking OTC medicine to control the pain.
31	149	The worst part was the intense cramps and spotting for the next week, which would return off and on for the following month.
31	150	I do have cramps sometimes that are worse than before I had the IUD, but I would take that over depression and anxiety any day.
31	151	Cramping the rest of the afternoon felt just like heavy period cramps-heating pad helped, I slept great & now at work with dull, bearable cramps.
31	152	Now I just get occasional spotting and mild cramps, nothing that a warm bath and OTC meds can’t fix.
31	153	The cramps and monthly periods varied from light to heavy.
31	154	Now at 7 months in, I have periods now that last for two weeks long on/off and painful cramps.
31	155	I still had periods on Skyla but they were much heavier and I had awful cramps.
31	156	The type of cramps I have received since the IUD was inserted are the type of cramps that hindered me with walking and even speaking.
31	157	I have to take ibuprofen every 4 hours to relieve the cramps.
31	158	She told me there would be three different cramps, each one would be stronger than the last.
31	159	Honestly, the first one was nothing, and the last two felt like regular period cramps.
31	160	I got my period a couple days ago and the cramps were very intense and my period was very heavy, will my period get better?
31	161	I feel much more in control of my life with this IUD and would recommend it to anyone willing to stick the 1st month cramps out.
31	162	The cramps are horrible and on top of that I get a uti all the time due to the skyla.
31	163	The insertion was pretty uncomfortable, and for the rest of the day I had bad cramps, but besides the first day it has been painless.
31	164	The main difference I'm noticing is that I get cramps all month long now.
31	165	And, during my actual period, the cramps are far more severe than they ever were before.
31	166	The aftermath of the cramps can be handled with a heating pad and some advil.
31	167	Bad cramps and spotting for about 6 weeks but then I've not even had a period now and it's been almost 6 months.
31	168	Pros my periods are super light, cramps are minimal, not pregnant, you don’t have to remember to take a pill, and it was $35 for 3 years.
31	169	With being on depo I didn't get my period and I have never had period cramps before.
31	170	It is 6 hours later and I am still experiencing cramps and bleeding (slightly).
31	171	I had horrendous cramps and bleeding the first 5 days after implantation.
31	172	The doctor informed me there would be 3 cramps pinches and we be done.
31	173	The pinches were like mild period cramps to me and lasted less than 3 seconds.
31	174	It hurt but it was just like having a bad period with intense cramps and after a few minutes I felt fine and drove myself home.
31	175	And I usually get pretty bad period cramps so it wasn't anything new to me.
31	176	(If you don't get bad period cramps it will definitely hurt) Walked out on my own and went home and took ibuprofen.
31	177	I had cramps and bleeding for two days (no worse than a rough period cycle) then I was back to normal.
31	178	When the PA put skyla in, by opening my cervix (hurts extremely bad), she described it as a few cramps but it was nothing like a cramp to me.
31	179	Since then, I have cramps and spotting regularly.
31	180	I'd recommend having a driver if you live far away from your doctor, as your cramps may vary.
31	181	It started  with cramps, stomach pains, and bloating.
31	182	The placement both times was mildly painful, no worse than my menstrual cramps.
31	183	It was great my cycles we only about 4 days no heavy bleeding, light cramps.
31	184	The insert wasn't bad just cramps.
31	185	I had constant killer cramps for the rest of the day, but today they have settled down and they aren't so bad.
31	186	It feels like period cramps but 30x stronger and constant (for an hour during & after insertion).
31	187	Light bleeding and bad cramps throughout the night.
31	188	I have not gotten any cramps since or bleeding.
31	189	I had Skyla placed 2 years ago within the first few months I gained 30lbs, sex drive plummeted, horrible cramps, I felt bloated constantly.
31	190	I've had trouble with just about every birth control I've had so this was my last straw I got skyla inserted a month ago and it didn't hurt at all I didn't have ibuprofen or anything before had it was a little discomfort same as with a regular Pap smear nothing different I had no bleeding afterwards did have cramps nothing too horrible and believe me my pain tolerance is horrible lol but I've had my first period on skyla and it's longer but I'm barely bleeding only have to wear panty liners no pads or tampons so my over experience was pretty good
31	191	My cycles were not heavy, and I didn't really experience any cramps, but bleeding constantly gets to be annoying.
31	192	The pain feels like long major cramps while on your period but slightly worse.
31	193	My cramps were so painful right after the insertion I had hot and cold flashes.
31	194	After my appointment I had painful cramps for three days and spotting for three months.
31	195	Every period after that for the following 6 months came with pretty sharp cramps the first few days.
31	196	The cramps have been like strong period cramps since then.
31	197	I only had cramps the first 3 days after insertion and yes those were uncomfortable too but they stopped.
31	198	The pain just felt like intense menstrual cramps.
31	199	My Doctor was awesome and walked through every step with me and it was about 3 cramps (one slight, medium, and severe cramp) and it was over in less than a minute.
31	200	To this day I still have a bit of cramps often but nothing too bad and my periods are much lighter.
31	201	And the cramps got worse and worse as the day went by .
31	202	Since then I've had no trouble just mild cramps.
31	203	I had cramps for the next few days and would take ibuprofen to help with the pain.
31	204	Before the Skyla I would never get cramps during my period and now they are awful.
31	205	I have continued to take my birth control pills (as directed from doctor) to help decrease cramps and bleeding.
31	206	I get sharp pain cramps to where I can't breathe or it will make it hurt more.
31	207	No cramps.
31	208	It's like really, REALLY bad period cramps.
31	209	The cramps people talk about is just your body's reaction to your uterus being poked.
31	210	I did start to get cramps when I got home that started somewhat painful but have been getting slowly better.
31	211	I've never had cramps before with my periods and I don't think they're awful.
31	212	I had no cramps upon insertion or immediately afterwards.
31	213	I thought it was super painful to have the procedure done & I had bad cramps & spotting/light periods on and off for about 3 mo.
31	214	The cramps were so painful I was often doubled over and felt like the wind was knocked out of me.
31	215	I stopped getting my period about ~7 months after being on the Skyla, but recently I've started getting the bad cramps again.
31	216	I did get slightly stronger cramps but that was fine.
31	217	I'm very petite and have always been VERY sensitive to hormones, I have NEVER been able to take any birth control without awful side effects and terrible GI ones, I ended up having surgery to remove endometriosis and had to choose a hormonal treatment to keep it from growing back, I chose skyla due to it having the least amount of hormones, I did have pretty bad cramping up until my first cycle but it helped with my PMS (had A LOT of bad symptoms) and could function with my cycles (endo made them debilitating) I didn't have any issues besides the cramps!
31	218	I had pretty bad cramps, bloating and PMS during the first couple days, and then it would taper off and I'd feel 100% normal.
31	219	Overall, I don't have bad mood swings, cramps are better, my period now is lighter but longer (11 days on first one, 9 days currently) and I have no spotting between periods even at only 2 months in.
31	220	The insertion was about a 5 on a pain scale, and the cramps after were pretty uncomfortable, but nothing ibuprofen couldn't handle.
31	221	My period decreased however my cramps increased times 10.
31	222	I previously would only have cramps on the day my cycle started but now it was the entire week leading up to it.
31	223	The cramps afterwards were very intense!
31	224	I have had fairly bad cramps every day since it was placed.
31	225	The reason my OBGYN suggested I get Skyla was due to my horrible period cramps in the first place.
31	226	I haven't had any spotting but I have had to take meds daily to deal with the cramps.
31	227	I am hoping the cramps will go away over the next week...I am not sure how much longer I can put up with them.
31	228	My cramps were excruciating the entire day and I would have sporadic sharp pains in my lower abdomen!
31	229	I regularly have period cramps that sometimes get so sharp I have to breathe through them and cannot stand up.
31	230	It felt no worse than 2 short, sharp period cramps for me.
31	231	Felt like bad period cramps.
31	232	My cramps and lower back pain were bad for a few days, and 1600 mg ibuprofen daily didn't help much.
31	233	There were 2 or 3 days when I didn't spot, then I started having bad cramps again + spotting, and a long and painful period followed that was a little lighter than usual.
31	234	My period came on and lasted for a week and it was heavy which they said it was normal in the first 3-6 months the only thing that I hate is the cramps that comes with them for me it is really painful but I took a 800mg ibruprofen and a heating pad and it goes away.
31	235	But my main side effects are vaginal dryness, more headaches and more painful breast and cramps.
31	236	I had a little spotting afterwards but have had no cramps since insertion.
31	237	I had the worst cramps of my life (no exaggeration and I always have crampy periods) for several hours after insertion and no amount of Ibuprofen or heat helped me.
31	238	Throughout the first day of having it, I felt mild cramps but nothing worse than a menstrual period cramp.
31	239	I had no cramps that day and only minor cramping and minor back pain for the first few weeks following insertion.
31	240	I did have more painful cramps at the beginning of my period, but nothing that was too unbearable.
31	241	I didn't have a period 3 months into it, but still had crippling cramps and aches like I was on my period at any given time.
31	242	Still get period, still get cramps.
31	243	The cramps and nausea remained very severe until the next morning.
31	244	My period used to be only a few days, very heavy, and I never had cramps.
31	245	With skyla I have light spotting that lasts twice as long with some pretty TERRIBLE cramps and nausea.
31	246	I felt minor cramps for about 10 seconds and had just an uncomfortable feeling the next day but after that everything has been fine.
31	247	I'm still getting really painful cramps, migraines, dizziness and some spotting.
31	248	It was intense cramps.
31	249	I just laid there for about a minute to let the cramps subside.
31	250	Yeah cramps are never comfortable and it feels weird knowing they're in your cervix but it's over so fast.
31	251	Period cramps last forever.
31	252	Felt the needle and some pressure, followed by a few cramps.
31	253	The cramps and minor bleeding lasted for about 1.5 months.
31	254	Really painful cramps once I got home for about 4 hours took aleve to help.
31	255	Day 2: No cramps light spotting as expected.
31	256	Days 3-12: Mostly just spotted lightly and had light cramps on and off.
31	257	Day 13-today: No bleeding no cramps no pain during sex.
31	258	If you've ever had bad period cramps, you know what it'll feel like.
31	259	There's about 3 very intense, but bearable, cramps that feel just like a bad period cramp.
31	260	As soon as my doctor was done I did experience cramps but nothing like I was expecting.
31	261	It just felt like I was having period cramps.
31	262	I have not had ANY spotting at all.. although I continue to experience "period cramps" almost everyday now.
31	263	Had skyla inserted 12/2/16 for my insanely bad cramps .
31	264	Spotted for 2-3 days after and am just now stopping random cramps.
31	265	It wasn't until right after insertion that I started having severe cramps.
31	266	The severe cramps lasted about an hour for me, and then were just mild for a few more hours.
31	267	It's now been a few days and no cramps, no bleeding!!
31	268	I had some cramps that night but not too bad.
31	269	The night afterwards I had terrible cramps, and my heating pad was my best friend.
31	270	VERY light spotting a fews days, and a few cramps here and there, but nothing I couldn't handle.
31	271	My period is almost over and honestly my cramps have been no different than any other period I've had.
31	272	It was so incredibly weird and cramps in an area I've NEVER felt before.
31	273	Anyways, had bad cramps the rest of the day to where I had to lay in bed all night.
31	274	But here's why I am getting it removed next Thursday; these early labor contraction like cramps are HORRIBLE!
31	275	I get the cramps every month for a week before my period, and I cry (actual tears) every time.
31	276	Its only been a week and I have had bad cramps and I have been light headed almost everyday since the insertion.
31	277	I've had a few cramps each month, but nothing crazy and 2 periods since the insertion.
31	278	The procedure itself felt like a slightly more extreme period cramp, and then for the next few days I had mild cramps that were on and off, nothing different from a normal period.
31	279	I do get cramps every month for about one entire day.
31	280	The insertion process was a bit painful and I had cramps for about 3 hours, but with some ibuprofen and a heating pad, it can sure be tolerable.
31	281	About 30 minutes later I experienced really painful cramps that lasted about 4 hours I took some aleve at the onset of the bad cramps.
31	282	I've not had anymore cramps since but I'm still spotting on and off very minimal which is expected.
31	283	So far I've had light spotting and some mild cramps, both of which were expected.
31	284	Pain would have been 8/10, it felt like horrible horrible cramps.
31	285	I am sexually active so it's worked so far as to prevent pregnancy , but the one thing I hate is the cramps.
31	286	Every month so far I've gotten these sharp and really painful cramps , yet I still don't bleed.
31	287	Insertion was not really painful, but I did have cramps for about 14 hours afterwards, the first 5 being debilitating.
31	288	I usually have very painful period cramps and this still felt much worse.
31	289	I do not recommend this because the side affects- cramps are extremely painful and unbearable.
31	290	My cramps varies too but use some motrin and you'll be good.
31	291	Two weeks after including for  me, heavy bleeding and HUGE cramps still.
31	292	It's crazy how everyone is taking meds before this easy IUD  insertion  but I know everyone is different my experience was so easy no cramps no pain I don't feel it know no side effects what so every.
31	293	I'm experiencing some mild cramps right now.
31	294	The insertion process is hard (be sure to take off work after) I had severe cramps for about 4 hours and then minor cramping the next day.
31	295	I felt like I was going to throw up, pass out and the cramps were so painful.
31	296	However, a week later and no more cramps or bleeding.
31	297	I would say the cramping DURING insertion was way worse than bad period cramps but only lasted like 30 seconds!
31	298	Not a cakewalk but if you're used to horrendous period cramps, very very tolerable.
31	299	That whole day I laid in bed and cried because the cramps were so bad.
31	300	Then when I was getting ready to have my period the cramps where still  unbearable nothing helped.
31	301	Yes the cramps felt like a very powerful menstrual cramp and it was not comfortable, but it was so so so short.
31	302	I left the office feeling completely fine, just feeling like I had menstrual cramps.
31	303	Following that I had bleeding, cramps and ovary pain for the entire duration that I had the IUD in.
31	304	The first five months were constant cramps and spotting.
31	305	The spotting has stopped but cramps randomly come and are intense.
31	306	Stick it out through the spotting and cramps and you'll realize it's so worth it!
31	307	I got my Skyla inserted a week ago and yes, the pain of the insertion is like an internal sharp pinch and a targeted set of cramps.
31	308	I was nauseous, sweating, and experiencing tremendous cramps.
31	309	I've had it for a month now and although my period cramps are the worst they've ever been, I think Skyla is worth it.
31	310	I was sweating, had abdominal cramps that felt like I was going to have diarrhea, and some menstrual cramps.
31	311	I had bad cramps for about 2 hours after insertion.
31	312	I had no cramps after.
31	313	I drove home normally but that night I had severe cramps and they continued for 2 weeks straight.
31	314	I couldn't work out and just wanted to lay in bed from how bad the cramps were, I would have to breath in and out very deeply to feel some sort of relief.
31	315	The cramps lasted the rest of the day but were gone the following day.
31	316	The pain was not unbearable at all just seemed to be the equivalent of three severe cramps in a row.
31	317	Initially there was a small amount of bleeding the first day and a lot of cramps.
31	318	The second day there was no bleed just mild cramps reaching the third day I have cramps every here and there but it is manageable.
31	319	Afterwards I did spot for a bit (day 3 of period), no cramps coming home but did have some mod during the night and took 400mg of advil.
31	320	I did not experience any cramps for the first 12 hours but once they kicked in they were no different than period cramps, a little ibuprofen here and there and everything was fine.
31	321	When I first got it I did experience a lot of pain, for at least a month I had very bad cramps and mood swings.
31	322	I talked to my doctor about the different IUD's and we decided the Skyla was most logical because I haven't been pregnant (good bc of the size of the IUD), I didn't want to completely stop my period, didn't want full hormones (just enough to hopefully help with my cramps), and obviously didn't want to get pregnant.
31	323	When it was inserted it did hurt, and I was in my bed the next two days with severe cramps.
31	324	Once in my car I felt those pesky cramps coming back.
31	325	It has been a year now cramps are seldom, period is light (I use panty liners) but lasts 8-10 days.
31	326	Nausea & cramps the next week.
31	327	I was bleeding for a month straight with harsh cramps.
31	328	I get horrible cramps even if I'm not on my Period, the pain makes me really nauseas.
31	329	Afterwards I had cramps that weren't killer but still kind of bad.
31	330	The cramps went away a day or two later... then I got my period.
31	331	(Eye roll) since I was a teen (now 23) I have experienced a bad life with cramps.
31	332	I still have crazy cramps but I feel good.
31	333	I will post again and hope these cramps go away for good.
31	334	However the months prior with the IUD were painful and my period was extremely heavy and would last 2-3 weeks with severe cramps.
31	335	I've had cramps since but nothing I'm not used to.
31	336	Afterward is when it became painful (cramps), but I would just recommend taking Advil.
31	337	I had a bit of cramps an hour later but right after the insertion they gave me middle for cramps.
31	338	The following day I had a bit of cramps and that was it.
31	339	However, I did get my period twice that month and the following month as well but with no cramps.
31	340	I had my first period about three days after insertion & it was a bit heavy & cramps.
31	341	Since my period has ended i haven't spotted once, and I haven't had any cramps.
31	342	I continued to have on and off extreme cramping for about 6 months, which was new for me because I never had cramps.
31	343	I never get cramps during my periods so I didn't know what I was expecting.
31	344	I got the IUD because my period cramps were so bad I couldn't stand.
31	345	Since insertion I've had no cramps!
31	346	My cramps are gone, my periods are regular, and I have no problems.
31	347	After that, I just felt some cramps but nothing I couldn't handle....I love it because I don't have to worry about getting pregnant or taking a pill everyday.
31	348	I had intense cramping (contraction like cramps) for about 30 seconds.
31	349	I had never experienced period cramps or anything before so...the pain I felt after insertion was almost unbareable.
31	350	It has helped considerable with my period cramps (they used to be brutal), but still, who wants to constantly be bleeding, bloated, and crampy.
31	351	The rest of the day I had minor cramps and I'm a baby when it comes to them.
31	352	I read the reviews and was expecting some really bad cramps during and after insertion.
31	353	The cramping during insertion was minor and after insertion I experienced cramps for a day.
31	354	These cramps was comparable to a bad period.
31	355	I have yet to experience terrible cramps after the initial insertion.
31	356	Have had serious cramps, been physically sick, no sex drive, 20lb weight gain.. Decided to have it removed.
31	357	The rest of the day I had to stay home because the cramps would come in waves and were severe.
31	358	I continued to have very BAD cramps for the rest of the day and up to the next morning, and could barely walk (still having small cramps 24h after) I never had periods on the shot, so maybe others used to cramps would take to it better.
31	359	I just got mine done about 3 hours ago and I did not realize how bad it actually hurt so now the cramps are really bad, overall I'm very excited because I hated the pill, it made me depressed.
31	360	I don't even get the cramps from when I am suppose to start.
31	361	About an hour later I had some bleeding then some heavy cramps, but after taking Midol they went away.
31	362	I bled for about 4 weeks straight and had some pretty bad cramps during that time.
31	363	I'm not completely period free- random spotting, seems like I have random PMS, and cramping but different than my usual cramps.
31	364	My cycle lasted a week with very light cramps.
31	365	It lasted maybe 20 seconds before subsiding into the feeling of menstrual cramps.
31	366	Those cramps lasted 3-4 days after insertion, and I spotted for the first month.
31	367	My bleeding is light, but WOW do I get horrible cramps.
31	368	I rarely got cramps prior to using Skyla, and these feel similar to the ones I had post-insertion.
31	369	Horrible cramps followed for the rest of the day, but by the next morning I was already back at work!
31	370	I have just started my second period since insertion, and it is incredibly light with no cramps!
31	371	I'm on month 4 almost 5 now and I've had TERRIBLE cramps but no periods.
31	372	These cramps are unbearable.
31	373	I had cramps yesterday and I seem to have lower back pain today but pain reliever helps with that.
31	374	The insertion was very uncomfortable for me, but I think it had something to do with the fact that I was incredibly nervous and my cramps that come along with my period had never been very bad, so I didn't know what to expect.
31	375	I will say that the cramps actually got pretty intense and I was taking crazy amounts of ibuprofen for like 4 days, but now everything is fine.
31	376	Some slight stomach cramps for the first couple of hours, but walking helped and it was completely manageable.
31	377	Dr said I would feel a little cramping, like my period cramps.
31	378	Those cramps were worse.
31	379	After it was over with I started to have severe cramps and although they're not as severe now, I'm still cramping badly 7 hours later.
31	380	My periods are getting shorter my cramps are getting better.
31	381	When she was inserting the IUD the cramps were absolutely awful.
31	382	However 20 minutes after insertion the cramps kicked in, I haven't had kids yet.
31	383	But I swear the pain level of the cramps are what I assume is how contractions feel.
31	384	Once I finally got home the contraction cramps were so bad I was laying on the floor crying.
31	385	Since insertion, I have had a period every month and the cramps are excruciating.
31	386	The insertion is about 10 seconds long of period cramps on steroids.
31	387	I had cramps the first few days, spotting since I wanna say October 3, 2016 to mid November.
31	388	I thought I would be fine, but I felt like I was going to pass out and had extreme cramps.
31	389	For the first couple of months I had cramps and bleeding every single day.
31	390	Haha I was in pain and having contraction like cramps for weeks.
31	391	Today was one month and I had severe cramps for hours.
31	392	God bless anyone else going through these cramps.
31	393	The insertion was pretty painful probably about a 7 on a 10 scale, the cramps were absolutely terrible and it would come and go for about 7 to 8 months with the cramps.
31	394	I had terrible cramps and bled non-stop for a month and a half and had heard that these side effects will occur for the first 3 months, luckily mine was half that time.
31	395	About 30-45 minutes later I had horrible cramps, which are expected, I made my uterus very angry.
31	396	The cramps , headaches , and mood swings were crazy and almost unbearable.
31	397	The insertion was painful and it gave me horrible cramps.
31	398	My periods got super heavy and I get sharp cramps now.
31	399	I had almost unbearable cramps that I had to remind myself to breathe through (coming from somebody with an extremely high pain tolerance, this was a nightmare.)
31	400	I took misoprostol the night before to soften my cervix which they said may cause cramps and had none.
31	401	I have spotting afterwards and cramps for 24 hours.
31	402	I did experience cramping like they said for the first 24-48 hours it was painful because I never get cramps just migraines during periods if not the week before it's the week of.
31	403	I had cramps and bleeding for several hours after and then it was fine.
31	404	I've noticed that Midol works the best for the cramps.
31	405	I've never had cramps in my life before this and I'm 20.
31	406	Afterwards I had cramps for about 48 hours and then after that I had a period for over a month.
31	407	I had cramps for the following 24 hrs, spotted a week,&my first period was the lightest its ever been.
31	408	Personal experience is that I have random period-like cramps that only last a few minutes or so and occasional spotting but nothing too serious.
31	409	Getting in did hurt but I had a ovarian cyst a couple months and it wasnt as bad as that (also never had children) more like a pressure then it was pretty bad cramps for the next 24/48 hours (I threw up but again not worse then the cyst) so after that fine.
31	410	I'll get some cramps but no period.
31	411	The insertion was unpleasant and painful.The cramps I experienced after were the worst cramps I have ever felt before.
31	412	So far I have had Skyla for about two and a half years, It works great,aside from very minimal cramps there is only one major complaint I have,I am 23 but can never have a clear face,as if I am ten years younger.
31	413	With that I had no periods & no cramps ever!
31	414	I did experience deep cramps for an hour and my period vanished.
31	415	Worst cramps.
31	416	Ifor had some bad period cramps but I took pain meds and slept most of it off, been 10 months since, still best decision, no periods really spotting very rare for me.
31	417	Post-insertion cramps were probably the worst part.
31	418	No Advil beforehand (mistake) so those hurt, nothing too crucial (I'd say I have high pain tolerance tho) Only had about 4 big cramps that day.
31	419	I decided to take the day off work; however, after taking Aleve my cramps went away.
31	420	It was a lot of pressure but wasn't long, had a couple of cramps after my doctor put it in, but then stopped a few minutes later and I never cramped again, I don't ever feel it.
31	421	I had skyla inserted a few months ago all I have to say is don't believe what other people say everyone is different and have different reactions to stuff and different bodies i was also afraid to get skyla because of what people had said about it but I definitely didn't want to go in birth control pills knowing I was going to easily forget to take them knowing me lol I did have a few cramps and I have not had any spotting I went to my last appointment everything was all good I'm also a breastfeeding mom and it did not reduce my milk supply at all witch is one of the reasons I also didn't want to get skyla because I was afraid to loose my milk supply but I didn't.
31	422	Since I had Skyla placed about seven hours ago I have not had any  cramps whatsoever.
31	423	I had it placed in June, cramps from insertion lasted a full 2 weeks with spotting everyday.
31	424	Because the cramps were so bad I couldn't go to school for the rest of the day.
31	425	I recomend staying home the day you get it done.It's day 2 and cramps aren't horrible but still are there and I'm spotting.
31	426	My experience with getting it inserted was pretty much just heavy-period like cramps that day and randomly for the next 2 week (I have never had children too and did not find the insertion painful, just crampy).
31	427	It hurt to have it inserted and I had cramps for the rest of the day, but then I was golden!
31	428	No more cramps!
31	429	I have always had heavy bleeding and intense cramps during my menstrual cycle.
31	430	There are occasional cramps, but they never last for longer than five minutes and occur maybe 3 times a day, so yeah, that's totally manageable
31	431	Once I got it however I had pretty intense cramps, lower back pain, & other period symptoms for at least a month.
31	432	I am used to very painful cramps and I can usually handle them but it was honestly a nightmare.
31	433	As time went on the cramps did subside and my body felt better but still not back to normal.
31	434	But then, about 2 or so weeks later, I got extremely severe sharp cramps 2 days before I started my period.
31	435	I started & it was pretty bad cramps, but bearable.
31	436	I started getting severe cramps again, only 5x worse.
31	437	I did have some major cramps the day of insertion,but since then A BREEZE!!!
31	438	My cramps are insane to the point that I've schduled to get Skyla removed.
31	439	I had cramps the day of and then only have had 3/4 days of cramping episodes since then.
31	440	I never cramped before Skyla, so the cramps are my only complaint; but nothing Tylenol can't fix.
31	441	I got it a week before my period, so I got my period a week later, everything was normal except the bad cramps  for about 10 mins the day I started my period.
31	442	Constant cramps, constant bleeding.
31	443	The drive home was okay until I got into my house almost passed out and had horrible cramps!
31	444	And then now 14 hours later I'm starting bleeding pretty heavily with some cramps still.
31	445	I never had any trouble with Skyla other than painful cramps during my period.
31	446	Two days post insertion, I've had little to few cramps, and only some spotting.
31	447	I still get cramps every now and then, but nothing too bad.
31	448	I also started getting pretty bad cramps that made it hard to even function some days.
31	449	At about 4 weeks the cramps were unbearable (felt like labor contractions) so needless to say I got it taken out.
31	450	It feels like the worst cramps of your life for 20 seconds then it's done.
31	451	So I was one of the unfortunate ones who had severe pain, cramps, and bleeding for a month after insertion.
31	452	The cramps lessen throughout time, and they come in extreme waves.
31	453	But it's no worse than your first day period cramps.
31	454	The cramps after the insertion got increasingly bad.
31	455	I've had ulcers, and I can say these cramps were the worst pain I have ever been in.
31	456	These cramps have continued almost every day for the past 6 weeks, and have severely impacted my life.
31	457	Since my appt I've had very minor cramps that feel like period cramps.
31	458	I ended up passing out twice during the insertion and the next two days afterwards were antagonizing cramps.
31	459	I am now 48-72 hours in & am experiencing no cramps & no bleeding.
31	460	the cramps were nothing like I ever felt before and you feel pinching a couple of times.
31	461	After I was done I was shaking and lightheaded and having cramps for about 3 hours.
31	462	I took more medicine and the cramps aren't as bad.
31	463	My doctor said that the insertion would feel like two small cramps (measuring) and one larger cramp (insertion).
31	464	Really bad cramps after procedure for about an hour and my pulse was considerably lower than normal.
31	465	Next morning just mild cramps.
31	466	Had a normal period but hardly any cramps.
31	467	Post insertion I have cramps no worse than period cramps and very light spotting which I expect to be over soon.
31	468	Luckily I did not shed one tear and drove home from the facility with the most horrible crucial cramps I've yet felt.
31	469	My cramps and period were gone by the next day.
31	470	Another thing is that even when I'm not on my period i would get random cramps.
31	471	I took 800 mg of ibuprofen before hand  and my nurse told me that I should just stay in pain meds for 24 hours because of the cramps, I did get cramps maybe 3 hours after I got the implant and a few of them sucked but they were like regular period cramps.
31	472	Insertion hurt like crazy, as if you were having period cramps that would make you want to double over in pain and go to the hospital.
31	473	also lower back pain & mild cramps.
31	474	I've had period cramps that were worse!
31	475	Slight cramps the first two days but ibuprofen took them away.
31	476	Insertion was pretty uncomfortable but very quick, didnt get light headed or anything and the cramps came immediately afterwards, they felt like my usual pretty bad menstrual cramps but it also feels like something is in there, its a different kind of cramp.
31	477	The pain lasted for under a minute and the rest of the day just felt like normal period cramps.
31	478	Since the insertion, I have had random cramps occasionally and random bits of brown blood spotting around the time for my period but it is nothing major!
31	479	I didn't have a cycle since May, I started bleeding a few days ago, it wasn't bad, but now it's super heavy but absolutely no cramps.
31	480	Woke up 2 hrs later with excruciating cramps and could not sleep the rest of the night.
31	481	For the rest of the day I certainly had cramps and some bleeding but wasn't as bad as everyone said.
31	482	Today upon waking up I have no cramps and am so far very happy with my decision.
31	483	Measuring your uterus, holding your cervix, and insertion, which means only 3 really tough cramps.
31	484	The night I got it in, I had crams that felt like bad period cramps but nothing some Advil couldn't help.
31	485	I had very minimal spotting but I had severe cramps for the next 2 days.
31	486	It felt like very extreme period cramps, and a burning sensation but nothing crazy.
31	487	Afterwards, I did spot for an hour or so & the cramps were outrageous.
31	488	It is worth it to get, as long as you can deal with a long period after skyla is inserted and extreme cramps for a short sections of time.
31	489	Worst cramps of my life.
31	490	NO cramps, or any other symptoms though!
31	491	I drove myself home and had the WORST cramps I've ever experienced just for a day or so.
31	492	When I first got it inserted it was a bit painful, I was bleeding for 2 weeks straight and the cramps were horrible !
31	493	I'm up and going with only small cramps so if you have any doubts I say go for it.
31	494	Even though I do not menstrate I do often still get the cramps during that time and they can be rough.
31	495	I went home fine but later that night I had the worst cramps, I thought I was going to die.
31	496	But after that night I was fine until 3 days later I got more bad cramps I couldn't even go to work.
31	497	I was able to drive home just fine and the next day there were still cramps but definitely not as bad as it was the previous day.
31	498	So far I'vE had horrible cramps, but I guess that's just my body getting used to something different....the procedure was okay the dr told me everything he was doing.
31	499	I got cramps for about a weekafter insertion.
31	500	Bled for about 5 weeks after and still get a 5-7 day period every month with terrible cramps for a week before my period comes .
31	501	In the past 6-7 months I've bled and had bad cramps after having sex .
31	502	It's been about 6 hours since the insertion and I have no cramps, and a small amount of sporting.
31	503	Felt a little 'off' the rest of the day, had cramps, and some spotting.
31	504	cramps and then it would be over just like that.
31	505	I also suffer from severe cramps almost every day since then.
31	506	I have a lot more cramping than I'm used to, but I hadn't ever really had bad cramps before so I guess I'm just paying my dues now.
31	507	I've always had bad cramps and heavy bleeding but now all of that has tapered off since I've had it so long.
31	508	It was painful but bearable, I felt 3 extremely severe cramps and it was over after that.
31	509	I've had cramps for the past 2 days, and they're nothing like the minor cramps I used to experience with my regular period.
31	510	Loss of appetite and moody because of the cramps but it's not that bad.
31	511	It is lasting longer than normal and the cramps are ten times worst.
31	512	Before this month, I would just have cramps but no actual bleeding.
31	513	Of course insertion was painful and there is a lot of cramping, but the cramps should improve after a couple of months.
31	514	It's definitely painful, but it's just like havin 3 severe menstrual cramps as each step is done.
31	515	Still have terrible pain with cramps and slight bleeder.
31	516	Since then, I have not had a day where I don't take ibuprofen for my cramps.
31	517	My cramps are really disrupting and occur ONLY when I am active at work.
31	518	The pain stopped all weekend but come Monday at noon after my lunch, my cramps came back and they came back stronger.
31	519	Immediately after insertion, I had severe cramps, felt nauseous and light headed.
31	520	I got skyla b/c I had very painful periods and very bad cramps and I wanted some form of birth control that would atleast stop the bleeding.
31	521	Good experience so far except cramps!
31	522	As of now, I am feeling cramps.
31	523	Just like regular period cramps.
31	524	I did feel a few cramps, which were pretty bearable.
31	525	I have always had extremely painful cramps.
31	526	I took 600mg of IBU because reviews suggested it but it didn't help the intense pain of the insertion and the cramps that started immediately.
31	527	I didn't get any cramps.
31	528	It's been 6 months, now, the first 5 were pretty heavy but not a lot of cramps.
31	529	I had very painful cramps for about 12 hours after insertion and spotting for a week or so afterwards but only had to take ibuprofen a few times after that first day and cramps were totally gone after a week.
31	530	I had cramps that night but the following day I felt fine and had unprotected sex (24 hrs after getting skyla), no pain at all.
31	531	I had such slight cramping for maybe 3 hours, literally nothing compared to period cramps and spotted on and off light brown for one day...
31	532	After the initial shock wore off it just felt like bad cramps.
31	533	The most painful part was getting my cervix dilated and I have cramps on and off.
31	534	Insertion didn't work the first time since I had bad cramps due to uneven cervix.
31	535	That helped a lot with the cramps.
31	536	I had several days with cramps afterwards but equal to having bad mentrual pain.
31	537	And just recently I've experienced some intense cramps so I take ibuprofen 2 times a day and it's been helping a lot.
31	538	I have had pain and cramps all day.
31	539	One day I can go without cramps the entire day, and another I can have severe cramps that completely unable me to do anything.
31	540	When the doctor mesured my cervix And I shed a tear but my doctor told me to suck it up (lol) the first month I had cramps and heavy bleeding everyday.
31	541	I do deal with severe cramps while on my period so I think I responded better to the progress of having it placed.
31	542	Also random extremely  intense cramps that I never experienced while on oral birth control.
31	543	When I first had it inserted, I basically felt very extreme sharp cramps.
31	544	Well I just got the Skyla put in yesterday morning, so far I've been quite crampy but it's a little different than regular period cramps, it's like I can feel the IUD in there and maybe it just needs to get situated but I feel like it's not sitting comfortably yet.
31	545	Just be prepared for cramps!
31	546	From the beginning i got excruciating cramps (when i was supposed to get my period) where i would have to stay home from work/school and stay in bed.
31	547	Nothing helped with the cramps, so i decided to get it removed.
31	548	After a few days, my cramps subsided but then my boobs became very tender.
31	549	My cramps are very light, nothing to take pain medication for, then again, I've had two 9lbs babies lol...all in all I would say find what works best for your body.
31	550	Then I almost passed out on my way home and had bad cramps and had to lie around for a couple hours.
31	551	Twice, I have gotten pelvic cramps after having sex, though I am not sure whether this is related to the IUD.
31	552	Since the insertion I have had an increase in intense cramps but no spotting - never used to get cramps before.
31	553	Had severe cramps the first week after insertion but it was managed by ibuprofen.
31	554	I had terrible cramps for about 6 hours after but after that, it was a breeze.
31	555	My cramps were nearly unbearable.
31	556	I'm on my 5th week and although Im not bleeding anymore (I was previously on Depo which made me bleed a consistent 3 1/2 months) It occasionaly cramps.
31	557	It felt like giving birth and the cramps lasted all day.
31	558	The insertion was painful and went home with slight cramps.
31	559	My doctor did not explain to me any side effects and when I left the office I got super dizzy and had terrible cramps that lasted about 3 days.
31	560	The next week I got my period and the night before I actually started to bleed I had the most terrible cramps of my life (or so I thought).
31	561	I have one problem with skyla and it's the cramps.
31	562	Before that my cramps were a breeze.
31	563	After starting skyla my cramps were horrible.
31	564	Throughout this entire process, I've also experienced a lot of headaches, cramps ( even when I'm not seeing my period) and mood swings.
31	565	I got mine put in 2 days ago and my cramps have completely gone away.
31	566	I've had the slyla iud for 4 months now and the first time I got it I had really bad cramps, dizzy and was sweating like crazy.
31	567	When I get my period I get the worst cramps of my life.
31	568	I've had very bad cramps since I started my period so maybe that's why I could handle it.
31	569	Really bad period cramps (never had before) 8-9 day light light bleeding (also never had a period that long before).
31	570	These cramps were completely debilitating.
31	571	I felt miserable cramps for the next few days & bad bloating.
31	572	I had horrible cramps, sick to my stomach, and dizzy for a few hours after.
31	573	The only negative things I experience now from skyla is horrible random cramps daily and I've been spotting ever since.
31	574	Getting it put in was painful and felt like bad cramps but it wasn't to bad.
31	575	My only issue is that my first 2 days of my period I get aweful cramps but the doctor said those will subside in a few months.
31	576	Slight cramps here and there but nothing crazy.
31	577	Insertion hurt like noones business, cramps afterward were the worst I've ever had, and my period before was pretty terrible.
31	578	Sometimes after climax there are temporary very painful cramps.
31	579	I was dizzy the hours after and did have some cramps but it only lasted about a day.
31	580	Although when I do get my period, I get cramps, which I never used to get when I was on the pill.
31	581	Overall my only complaint is the cramps I now get.
31	582	I got my Skyla inserted about 4 days ago and the worst part was after the insertion because I got some pretty painful cramps.
31	583	I feel very painful cramps during these periods but if u don't want to get pregnant what's a couple of cramps ?
31	584	Granted I have really bad cramps when I get my period, which is part of the reason I needed birth control.
31	585	I get horrible cramps and discharge a week before them.
31	586	The next couple days I had terrible cramps.
31	587	My insertion was definitely a 9/10, 9 being almost unbearable.The first 3-4 weeks were crazy.My cramps were intense & I was sleeping with a heating pad almost every night.
31	588	I didn't have an appetite and being on my feet at work made the cramps worse.
31	589	Overall my cramps have became more intense and I would recommend taking pain pills before and after Insertion.
31	590	This part lasted about 3 minutes with long intesne cramps, after she was finished the pain was gone.
31	591	On the ride home I did experience cramps but I was still able to function.
31	592	Now on day 7 I'm still have pretty bad cramps.
31	593	I took a nap about an hour afterwards and woke up with no cramps, just slight uncomfortableness.
31	594	I got it originally because my cramps were so bad, they sidelined me for days.
31	595	The cramps in the beginning were painful and my period lasted a full 7 days instead of the usual 4-5 days.
31	596	When I actually got it done, it was not painful at all, it was just slightly more intense than a Pap smear, accompanied with period cramps.
31	597	I had slight cramps for a few days after but nothing Advil couldn't take care of.
31	598	Since then, I've been constantly throwing up, completely lost my appetite, and the cramps are so unbearable that I've called out of work twice.
31	599	Along with the cramps comes the lower back pain so it makes it nearly impossible to ever get comfortable.
31	600	I spotted for two days after and then only got a light period with no cramps every six weeks after.
31	601	I went back three days later and they used an ultrasound the only pain I felt was the cramps after which were hell but that's not why I am giving it a bad rating!
31	602	I just had Skyla put in five minutes ago and I think my review was more of the insertion because I don't know how it's going to react with my body obviously since it's the first day of insertion.so here's my God honest truth on how it felt when he was inserting my IUD he did briefly explained to me that when he was going to insert my IUD it was just going to feel like a cramp and when he clamped my cervix it definitely felt like a bad cramp was happening and then to measure my cervix that probably was one of the worst cramps I've ever felt it definitely was an uncomfortable feeling but if he kept telling me to breath and tell yourself you can handle  it .
31	603	It was fine obviously I made it through it's tolerable but the measure ment of the cervix and the clamp was the most uncomfortable feeling everything else is fine I walked out of there I don't even feel like I have cramps right now so everything's fine except for the insertion portion of it
31	604	It hurt me, I had horrible cramps while I was getting it inserted.
31	605	I've been having mild cramps since.
31	606	As everyone else, I was told there will be spotting and cramps but they will stop.
31	607	Spent the month after either taking painkillers or drinking wine in bed because the cramps made me unable to stand or walk.
31	608	After 4 months I'm still randomly getting severe cramps that force me to lie down.
31	609	I had some pretty bad cramps the day of and the day after but nothing after that.
31	610	But ever since I got the skyla I have been on a non stop period and been having cramps such as feeling like im being stabbed in the uterus and in the back by knifes it was completely aweful I have chosen to get it removed and I don't recommend it.
31	611	Physical activity and heating pads help immensely but even without cramps aren't that bad.
31	612	All week I've had severe cramps but it like a bad period when it first came.
31	613	(But keep in mind I'm 16 and have had no kids lol, also it is different for everyone I guess) after I got it inserted which only took about 3-5 minutes I had the worst cramps ever, my knees and my back also started hurting.
31	614	I cried because the cramps were so painful.
31	615	But today (which is the day after) I'm not feeling any cramps or hurting any where.
31	616	Day four- learned that post-sex cramps are apparently a "thing" with IUDs.
31	617	I would rather have weight gain vs periods and weeks of spotting terrible cramps .
31	618	It was told to me that my periods were gonna be lighter and cramps lighter as well.
31	619	I would bleed after sex and have cramps for days afterwards, with sharp localized pain.
31	620	This is the most painful and constant cramps that I've ever been through.
31	621	My cramps afterward were very mild and bleeding has been extremely minimal.
31	622	the past few days ive had no cramps and only light spotting.
31	623	I had what felt like period cramps and light spotting during the first month, and my heating  pad was my best friend.
31	624	The cramps are not long lasting rather very sharp and random.
31	625	Insertion was pretty painful and i had cramps for a week.
31	626	Before Skyla 3-4 day long periods and no cramps.
31	627	I really didn't have bad cramps.
31	628	Just light cramps, more as a precaution I took 2 Tylenol.
31	629	It was a painful insertion for me with 3 very intense cramps, each lasting about 10 seconds.
31	630	Only some pressure and cramps for a couple minutes.
31	631	Mild cramps after insertion, and regular /light period.
31	632	Menstrual cramps are new for me now, although I just got my period back after having my 1st kid.
31	633	Also a little moody, but probably due to PMS and cramps!
31	634	What's hard is the very intense cramps I consistently got for 7 weeks along with the constant spotting.
31	635	I get very bad cramps from it to the point where I wake up in the middle of the night.
31	636	With Skyla, they last about 7 days on average with bloating, cramps, moodiness, and exhaustion, but nothing like what I had before.
31	637	My periods were easy to get through before the insertion with essentially no cramps, no mood swings, no bloating, light bleeding, etc.
31	638	My cramps have gone one notch down from when I got it.
31	639	The bleeding and cramps have continued almost daily since I've gotten it done...
31	640	Afterwards, cramps & spotting for a week or so.
31	641	I get random cramps sometimes but its not bad given how effective this is with hardly any side effects
31	642	However, keep in mind that I've always had very severe cramps.
31	643	It felt like a pinch combined with the worst period cramps I've ever had.
31	644	After the insertion I was very shaky and slightly crampy and light headed but within 5 to 10 minutes I was back to normal with minor cramps.
31	645	Less than 24 hours later and I feel slight cramps but overall feel fine.
31	646	No cramps really for the rest of the day honestly.
31	647	The worst part were the cramps that followed afterwards for a day but nothing a heating pad and some Advil couldn't resolve.
31	648	I am now on my second day and the cramps have subsided almost completely.
31	649	The painful cramps I got with insertion pretty much lasted for a week.
31	650	The second week of cramps weren't as bad but they were still awful, only 800mg Ibuprofen helped.
31	651	I never gotten cramp really bad before but with this I get cramps at least 2 weeks before my period when it decides to come on time...
31	652	It just felt like really intense cramps and then for about 30 minutes after the procedure I was very crampy.
31	653	It's now an hour past the procedure and I feel fine , hopefully no cramps will set in later .
31	654	You do get random cramps, but I can tell that despite my not bleeding on my period I know that I am.
31	655	The insertion and cramps afterwards were some of the worst pain I have experienced!
31	656	Afterwards I quickly felt very intense period cramps, which lasted 3-4 hours.
31	657	Yes, I had cramps the rest of the day, but I was so excited to get off the pill I didn't care.
31	658	I also had frequent cramps despite never having period cramps before.
31	659	I felt 3 or four sharp pinches and the usually bad period cramps.
31	660	Had bad period cramps and light spotting for the rest of the day.
31	661	I was prepared for pain during the procedure and some cramps afterward.
31	662	I get super bad cramps every month (the pain is so bad I often faint and throw up).
31	663	So I was prepared for the cramps and figured it'd be worth it.
31	664	No worse than my regular cramps.
31	665	I was not lightheaded, only bleeding I assumed was from my period, and I had no cramps afterward.
31	666	Insertion was a bit "crampy" but I get horrible cramps anyways, however, measuring the cervix was awful!
31	667	My periods are almost non existent but I'll get a few painful cramps as a reminder.
31	668	I had some mild cramps for about 5-6 hours after, and then totally normal like nothing happened.
31	669	I'm used to bad menstrual cramps but this is next level.
31	670	After the procedure I felt like using the restroom and I had HORRIBLE cramps for three hours, lost my breakfast.
31	671	Afterwards the cramps came in waves.
31	672	The pain feels like normal cramps, only sharp and occurring more often.
31	673	For the next 4 hours I had horrible cramps - nothing I haven't had before, just as a really bad period.
31	674	Then the rest of the day I had cramps, nothing bad, but still hurts.
31	675	Worse pain I have ever felt and I had natural labor before, I spotted for a week then it stopped , then these unusual cramps started where I would have to stop what ever I was doing and breathe throu the pain, it was awful.
31	676	Used a heating pad to help with the cramps.
31	677	Caused cramps and weight gain took it out after 3 months after the crazy mood swings
31	678	Afterwards I had mild cramps, similar to first day period cramps, but to be fair they wanted me on my period during insertion so who knows if it's from the insertion or just normal period cramping.
31	679	I did feel cramps the rest of the day.
31	680	My period is now very light and I get mild cramps.
31	681	During my first period I had very sharp, very centralized cramps and lasted only for a few minutes but happened once a day for the first three days.
31	682	I barely get cramps.
31	683	But now I think I'm on my actual period (the bleeding is heavier) and the cramps are NO JOKE - definitely worse than before.
31	684	I'm a little campy but I've honestly had worst cramps.
31	685	Lol but then after that I had severe menstrual cramps that lasted for a few hours after the procedure.
31	686	After a couple hours if being home I did start to get minor cramps but it wasn't so bad I was prepared for it since I was told ahead that it would happen.. so far these couple days have been smooth with a cramp here and there.
31	687	After that I spotted for forever, I have random stabbing spasm cramps, and I've experienced a different.. Scent.. Down there.
31	688	I never had cramps and now I get a deep dull ache that I had never experienced before the Skyla.
31	689	No cramps at all.
31	690	Insertion wasn't bad but the cramps afterwards were.
31	691	The 6 weeks following I bled almost everyday and had little random lightning-storms of bad cramps.
31	692	I still have bad cramps for a few days each month, but I'm finally glad I got this IUD.
31	693	First of all, I bled everyday for the first two months along with horrible cramps.
31	694	Going in it just felt like a weird cramp and it was pretty uncomfortable but considering the facts that it was over in a few minutes, I'm used to terrible cramps, and I'm now completely protected from pregnancy and more painful periods for three whole years, I found it to be completely worth it.
31	695	I have cramps so bad some days I can't go to work.
31	696	Since I stopped taking ibuprofen the pain has subsided to right before period cramps and sometimes when I'm aroused or after having an orgasm.
31	697	I was quit dizzy and the cramps were miserable.
31	698	No more cramps or pain.
31	699	After completion I had to lay there for at least 10 minutes from the extreme cramps I got afterwards.
31	700	Once home the cramps did not let up at all.
31	701	The 1st month or so was nothing but pain but it was from spotting and cramps from getting used to something foreign in your body.
31	702	I first tried mirena, but turns out my cervix is "kinked like a hose" and so it consequently would not fit, but I still got the terrible cramps and all that.
31	703	7 months later, I still get terrible cramps like when I got it inserted, sometimes  it is induced by sex and it hurts like anything.
31	704	But now I am only feeling occasional cramps.
31	705	I took it easy for the rest of the day and haven't had cramps but in still bleeding a little.
31	706	The actual process of getting it in did not bother me but after I had awful cramps, felt nauseous and lightheaded.
31	707	The cramps have not gone away but have lightened a little bit.
31	708	Test) I sometimes get random cramps, but it will literally be a cramp and fades away.
31	709	I had skyla inserted this morning and for me at least it did not hurt that bad I'm 19 and never had a child I haven't really encountered any cramps post insertion.
31	710	I also took something for cramps about 30 minutes before the appointment.
31	711	When inserted you only feel MILD cramps , just as if you were getting your cycle.
31	712	That night I did not sleep the cramps were so bad I was crying and contemplating having my boyfriend take me to the hospital.
31	713	The cramps stayed around for about another 7 day with them decreasing around the 4th day.
31	714	I haven't had any additional cramps or bleeding either.
31	715	The bad cramps after the insertion last for about a week.
31	716	My cramps are worse and I break out more.
31	717	The only negative thing I have to say is that I've had some spotting and random cramps for the last month but nothing too bad at all.
31	718	I just wanted to write about the experience of getting it put in because so many people write about the pain of it and also the cramps.
31	719	I was worried because I got mine on Christmas Eve and I had a lot to do that day but I barely had any cramps the whole day.
31	720	The first day I have experienced cramps and tension in my lower stomach.
31	721	I was having bad cramps on and off my periods with the paragard too.
31	722	When I got the Skyla, I had brief spotted and cramps for 1 day.
31	723	No pain during intercourse and no weird cramps.
31	724	When I got home I have a heated pad on the cramps all day and night.
31	725	Afterward, I still don't get cramps, some periods have been really light, but I have had a period that was over a week late and one that was two weeks long.
31	726	I'm not planning to have any more babies, so def the IUD sounds like a good idea for birth control... Now I got Skyla last week and the procedure on my experience was painless I did not feel any cramps or nothing whatsoever, so I was very exited about it now two days later I felt a bump on my anus (hemorrhoids) so I'm considering this is a skyla side effect as I never had that problem before..
31	727	Nothing you can't handle if you've had bad cramps before.
31	728	About 3 hours later the cramps came back, at like a 5/10 pain level.
31	729	The only flaw is that I get random painful cramps that last about 20 mins.
31	730	I do spot, and I can tell I'll spot because I get cramps, almost like menstrual cramps.
31	731	My periods are 4-5 days with cramps
31	732	After that I bled for 3 weeks still with cramps and spotted for a few months, while still getting my period.
31	733	Everything has been fine up until about two months ago and I've started getting really bad cramps again.
31	734	My first month consisted of very bad cramps and my period seem to last for two weeks non-stop.
31	735	Worst cramps of my life, when I left the office, I stayed in my car for twenty minutes because I was incapable to drive as my legs were numb from the pain.
31	736	I had two mild cramps then one last sharp cramp(lvl 6) as insertion was happening then back to mild(lvl 2) day-long cramps along with spotting.
31	737	Had cramps off and on for the next couple of days then they went away.
31	738	I get PMS and very mild cramps for a bit when my period is about to start.
31	739	My doctor prescribed me Misoprostal to take the night before and the cramps were very very bad but Advil did help and so did heating pads.
31	740	I still get awful cramps and it has made my period last at least two weeks sometimes longer!
31	741	It wasn't that it was cramps, I felt more of intense pressure then anything else.
31	742	Occasionally I will feel slight cramps but only really minor.
31	743	After insertion, I had really bad cramps (I'm pretty tolerant to pain but this was these were worst cramps ever).
31	744	It wasn't debilitating pain for me - just uncomfortable with two sharp cramps (maybe a 8/10 on the pain scale, but they only lasted 30 seconds or less combined).
31	745	I got it inserted at 4pm and was having 7/10 cramps the rest of the night, took some tylenol PM and slept like a baby.
31	746	Been having 3/10 cramps last few days, but that's it.
31	747	Got skyla inserted  on Nov 19 and have been in intense pain along with the worst cramps I've ever felt in my life ever since.
31	748	Cramps afterward were probably the most painful cramps I've had in my life.
31	749	The worst of the cramps lasted about a day and a half.
31	750	at worst it felt like minor menstrual cramps.
31	751	Since then it's been a little achey, but again very mild; I've had cramps much worse than this.
31	752	I feel sex activates my bleeding for some reason and it gives me light cramps I don't have them as bad as I used to though.
31	753	it was period cramps times 10.
31	754	After the horrific experience I had to lay on the table for another hour due to the cramps.
31	755	The main reason I got this was to control my horrible cramps I get every month and the second day I woke up from the pain again.
31	756	It's been 4 days and I'm laying in bed still with so much pain from my cramps I haven't gone to work and I haven't stopped bleeding.
31	757	From time to time I get birth control cramps, especially after having sex with my husband.
31	758	I bled for about a month after that I had regular periods but terrible cramps to the point of throwing up.
31	759	I have become depressed and have severe cramps that I never had before.
31	760	Now I get very light cramps every once in a while.
31	761	The worst of the pain is right before my period the cramps from ovulating and right before my cycle starts.
31	762	It was like period cramps on steroids.
31	763	The discomfort from getting the IUD inserted wasn't as bad as my period cramps, granted I typically have severe cramps.
31	764	I did have slight cramping after the insertion nothing bad, feels like a slight period cramps.
31	765	Had some cramps but I'm happy with my decision
31	766	Two days a month I spot some and have some mild cramps and that's it.
31	767	The insertion was painful: it felt like three cramps with the actual insertion being the worst and longest.
31	768	Now, 2 wks in, I'm having mild to severe cramps (I suspect ovulation?).
31	769	I had spotting for the first month and had a normal period with slightly worse cramps, but it was nothing ibuprofen couldn't fix.
31	770	Horrible cramps came the next day and on and off for the next 2 months.
31	771	All I felt was medium, period- like cramps.
31	772	The initial cramps were pretty bad 7/10 in pain but after about an hour they stopped.
31	773	It felt like moderate to severe menstrual cramps, which continued from time of insertion (9:45am) to about 5:00pm, as well as very heavy bleeding.
31	774	I've been really happy overall with Skyla but I've been experienced A LOT of cramps and A LOT of spotting.
31	775	Had some cramps the first few weeks but now its october i haven't had cramps in months and my periods are pretty regular.
31	776	I spot occasionally and have random cramps that last about ten minutes but overall it isn't that bad.
31	777	The cramps were the worst cramps I have had in my entire life- I couldn't focus, I was in tears- really the most painful experience ever.
31	778	Day 1 i had horrible cramps all day and some nausea Day 2 i felt amazing no cramps so sickness nothing Day 3 I found the lovely side effect of extreme emotion.
31	779	I was a roller coaster of emotion all day with some random cramps throughout the day Day 4 I have had some cramps off and on but the emotions are in check today.
31	780	So far so good, no major complaints except hoping the cramps and spotting subside soon
31	781	Although I don't want kids now, I hope to have them in the future and my frequent cramps scare me even more that I may not be able to have children.
31	782	Just imagine the worst menstrual cramps thats how it feels while it's being put in.
31	783	I am still waiting for the cramps to stop, but they are tolerable- my heating pad, and pamprin has been my bestfriend.
31	784	I haven't felt moody, nausea, or any really side effects- just mild, period like, cramps.
31	785	Other than the cramps, I am happy with my Skyla.
31	786	I've always had really bad cramps so the doctor suggested this because it can lessen cramps and I didn't have to remember to take something everyday.
31	787	I felt a sharp pain as the IUD was inserted and experienced cramps throughout the day.
31	788	I did have some sharp cramps sporadically throughout the first two weeks I had the IUD, but they subsided.
31	789	Have had the worst cramps of my life since, 2 Vicodin haven't done anything.
31	790	It felt like an extended pap smear with a few uncomfortable pinches and mild cramps.
31	791	Upon insertion I experienced cramps, my hands tingled, and I felt like I was going to vomit.
31	792	I've now been experiencing severe cramps and bleeding after intercourse.
31	793	After insertion I had the worst cramps for the first view months.
31	794	I'm not one for heavy periods usually nor do I ever get cramps.
31	795	It took about 3 hours for me not to be in excruciating pain due to cramps, but like I said I'm not used to them at all.
31	796	Since having it my cramps have been terrible and seem to only disappear for about a week and a half or so each month.
31	797	I had no cramps or pain afterwards but I had chills, diarrhea, dizziness, I was unbearably nauseous and my anxiety was off the charts.
31	798	It felt like hard cramps, something swimming in my uterus lol.
31	799	All you feel is a slight cramping with insertion which if you've ever had period cramps it's nothing.
31	800	The pain when I got it inserted wasn't that bad, it just lasted about 1 minute and for the cramps I just had a couple tylenols and that was just enough.
31	801	Not to mention the cramps I've had continuously every month since having it inserted.
31	802	I'm tired of the cramps!
31	803	Afterwards I got the worst cramps of my life, and it took a full 24 hours for me to be able to recover.
31	804	After about a month of having it, I would get the worst cramps I have ever got, up to now I haven't got my period.
31	805	I spot sometimes but other then that I have gained about 15/20 pounds after I got it, I get horrible cramps even though I'm not on my period and I'm always moody.
31	806	In reality it took no more than 3 minutes with 2 major cramps.
31	807	They each lasted a couple of seconds and were maybe a 4 out of 10 on the pain scale (and I don't usually get cramps at all).
31	808	Since then I've had zero cramps or spotting!
31	809	The cramping I experienced was no worse than the cramps I get for my period and I took medication throughout the day to control it.
31	810	Oh and another thing  before I was on skyla I would never experience cramps  when i was on my period and with this thing they were horrible.
31	811	I got Skyla inserted like 4 months ago and to be quite honest, my periods can go from like 10-12 days at a time with horrendous contraction-like cramps and also I get these cramps even when I'm not on my period it really sucks!
31	812	The worst side effects are that it will increase your cramps and menstrual pain, but it will get better over a few months.
31	813	I just want to know when the spotting will go away and i do get cramps here and there.
31	814	There were two times where it was uncomfortable (felt like two quick cramps for 3-5 seconds each) and then it was over!
31	815	I have my period for over two weeks and get the most horrendous cramps and pains during this time and sometimes randomly experience the same pain even when I'm not ovulating.
31	816	I just worked out and got the cramps again.
31	817	I had some pretty severe cramps on and off the first day or so into my period.
31	818	I had some menstrual like cramps and bleeding for 2-3 days.
31	819	Turned into just really bad period cramps.
31	820	I started my period 2 weeks after insertion, cramps weren't too bad, seemed to be normal and the period lasted a normal 6-7 days.
31	821	I am having contraction like cramps and have not stopped bleeding..
31	822	The cramps are horrendous and I am considering having it removed!
31	823	However, 6 hrs later I started getting bad cramps I remedied w/   sleeping through it.
31	824	Now just spotting & occasional mild cramps, but no regrets
31	825	HOWEVER the cramps afterwards were some of the worst pain I've ever experienced.
31	826	The next day there were barely any cramps.
31	827	However last night the cramps returned, they were not as painful as before but it prevented me from sleeping and they were enough to groan in pain once every 5 minutes.
31	828	Today, the cramps are still there but not as bad.
31	829	Im hoping the painful contraction-like cramps never return.
31	830	I took 2 Aleve and the pain/severe cramps were gone.
31	831	Then I had horrible cramps that made me double over.
31	832	But the cramps I get during my period are very painful!
31	833	The only grief I have received from the little IUD was monthly cramps that I associate with 'my body trying to get rid of it' and sometimes it's so painful I have to curl on the floor, stay still, and sometimes whimper and cry.
31	834	Four weeks later and I am spotting constantly, extreme cramps, Tender sore swollen breast and incredibly bloated.
31	835	The insertion itself wasn't too painful, but I did have bad cramps for the rest of the day after insertion.
31	836	However, I no longer get cramps with each period.
31	837	After the insertion I barely even had any cramps .
31	838	Finally done & I had some bad cramps for the rest of the night so I took some ibuprofen and snuggled on my couch it's been two days and I have no pains!
31	839	It was basically menstral cramps but 100 times worse.
31	840	I had non-stop extreme cramps for about 6 hours after the procedure and they finally went down after taking Midol.
31	841	Could barely drive home and horrible cramps at least 5 hrs after.
31	842	Now I just take ibuprofen some days I have cramps some days I don't.
31	843	I was on the pill for cramps, but I wasn't it taking it as directed.
31	844	Minor cramps briefly after.
31	845	I got my Skyla installed on July 13 the pain when it was being placed was awful I felt like I never wanted to even experience labor pain the whole night I felt awful the next day was better haven't stop spotting yet over this weekend me and my boyfriend finally had sex no pain but we started to play around him tickling me me moving around and for the last 4 days I've had the worst cramps I never had cramps before it feels awful like if it had penetrated my uterus can't exercise or do much because of fear of messing the device I'm going for my 1 month check up and I might get it removed
31	846	I only bled for that day and 1 day after and the cramps subsided after the first day.
31	847	I was on the pill for 5 years prior to Skyla and had never really had cramps due to that.
31	848	Now that I'm not taking the pill my period cramps have been intense but I doubt it's due to the IUD.
31	849	Other than the normal that-time-of-the-month cramps and bleeding, I've had neither spotting or random cramping.
31	850	When it was placed I just experinced really bad cramps that made me hold my breath.
31	851	About an hour after I had bad cramps and that lasted two days.
31	852	I read reviews on people saying it only hurts a little and then you have just normal period cramps.
31	853	I got on the shot so I could stop my cramps.
31	854	So if you have/had bad cramps don't get this.
31	855	You just feel mild pressure and will feel yourself getting cramps immediately, or they are just normal period cramps.
31	856	It just feels like cramps.
31	857	I felt great after a little bit of cramps but nothing to much.
31	858	it felt very uncomfortable and the cramps afterwards were awful.
31	859	He tells me few days cramps & blood.
31	860	Im 22 years old, getting married and Have not had sex Also I have terrible cramps and miss work So I decided to get the IUD because I suffer from migraines and can't take pills with estrogen.
31	861	she inserted the skyla it felt as if I had the worst cramps of my life.
31	862	the cramps lasted about and hour and came back later in the day.
31	863	That night I began to bleed a lot and have horrible cramps that lasted two days.
31	864	After the first week I was completely fine, occasional cramping but I have always had really bad cramps.
31	865	No pain what so ever just felt like period cramps nothing to cry about.
31	866	I get cramps a week before my period and during, and I used to only get cramps about once or twice a year.
31	867	The cramps were not bad at first.. it took a few days for the cramps to happen, then it was just slightly worse than normal period cramps.. they only lasted for a couple of days.
31	868	So I had absolutely terrible cramps to begin with.
31	869	If I could suggest anything, don't have it inserted on the first day of your period, if you have terrible cramps like I do.
31	870	I had the skyla put in after my period cramps had gotten just to much to handle.
31	871	I got it inserted and it felt like a 6 on pain; not even comparable to some of the cramps I had previously.
31	872	Within two days the cramps were gone.
31	873	My cramps about 30 minutes after were breathtaking but nothing too bad.
31	874	You'll have some major cramps for a few minutes, so I'd suggest you stay lying down until you feel pretty normal again.
31	875	I have had severe cramps nonstop since the procedure, and ibuprofen isn't cuttin it.
31	876	All I felt were cramps that were similar to usual menstrual cramps, nothing painful.
31	877	Afterwards, I felt a bit of discomfort, similar to cramps.
31	878	I've had maybe 3, 4 little cramps at the most since & a little spotting.
31	879	It literally look about a minute, and it felt like my normal period cramps but just a bit intensified.
31	880	Then I experienced slight cramps (not extremely painful, just an uncomfortable on and off ache) and daily spotting.
31	881	It hurt after, but I took a hot bath to help my body relax, which helped the cramps.
31	882	I'm currently still spotting very lightly and do have some cramps but they are just like very light period cramps, nothing a little Advil won't take care of.
31	883	It has taken about 8 months to get to light spotting, but I feel like my cramps are worse than before.
31	884	The pain has definitely seemed worth it, my cramps are now virtually gone and my "periods" are now constant and are VERY light spotting.
31	885	That night I had some painful cramps but nothing some ibuprofen couldn't handle.
31	886	The next day I felt completely fine, just some minor cramps here and there but no weight gain or mood changes.
31	887	2 days after insertion, I started experiencing severe cramps and it continued for the rest of the month every 2-3 days.
31	888	For the past week and a half, I've been having extremely painful cramps.
31	889	Last week I went back to my gyno for cramps and I got an internal ultrasound.
31	890	I had bad cramps for days.
31	891	Along with cramps I had diahrrea for the rest of the day and bleeding for the next 3 weeks.
31	892	My cramps have tolerably increased during my period.
31	893	It really just felt like period cramps.
31	894	The cramping was only slightly worse than my usual period cramps, but they didn't last for nearly as long.
31	895	My Doc said I would experience some slight cramping during insertion and light cramps throughout the evening.
31	896	Now it's been in for a month & cramps are rare & tolerable.
31	897	I had mild cramps and spotting throughout the day, but with advil it was totally fine!
31	898	Before my appointment I took a couple ibuprofen (not for the insertion but for my existing cramps).
31	899	I had one or two tiny cramps just after it was placed, but it was nearly an hour and a half after the placement before I got any real cramps.
31	900	I had really bad cramps for about 2 days & even missed a little bit of school but I hate pain & can not stand it.
31	901	After the insertion I had craps very mild but cramps for the first few days.
31	902	3 days after insertion I had really bad cramps and I had to take medication to relieve the pain.
31	903	I was put on birth control pills for severe cramps, however, I tried 4 brands of pills and was unable to tolerate combined hormones.
31	904	I only felt some cramping but I am used to severe cramps anyway so it was tolerable.
31	905	The insertion wasnt so bad, cramps for a day.
31	906	The cramps lasted only a day or two more, and then they only came periodically after that.
31	907	Insertion was uncomfortable and the cramping lasted for the rest of that day (worst cramps I've ever had).
31	908	Insertion was not the most comfortable feeling,  cramps.
31	909	It was 3 cramps.
31	910	The insertion was quite painful and I had cramps for a few days and then spotting for about a month afterwards, but since then my periods have been getting lighter and seemingly a bit farther apart.
31	911	Skyla is great at prevent pregnancy however the insertion was extremely painful - worst cramps I have felt.
31	912	But I also think it gave me an advantage,I had no spotting or anything except the cramps for over a week.After that I had a bit of spotting, but not too bad.I got my first period, which was delayed by about 2weeks, I'm not going to lie about it,it was pretty excruitating,always has been.
31	913	It was an awful day of cramps the day I got it put in.
31	914	And I am used to cramps, but those cramps were awful.
31	915	They're regular now but the God awful cramps continue.
31	916	But I am not pregnant and other then cramps and weight it's been awesome.
31	917	Afterwards, I had two days of cramps and spotting, but nothing unbearable.
31	918	I have more intense cramps around the time of my period but my period lasts less than 3 days.
31	919	I had cramps for a day and a half.
31	920	I still get cramps maybe not a heavy flow but still crazy cramps during my time of the month.
31	921	The first month was non stop spotting and a lot of it along with really bad cramps.
31	922	My first two periods after insertion gave me the most terrible cramps, but have since lightened up a lot as has my period flow.
31	923	Now, a year later,  I don't bleed much and I don't cramp either.
31	924	When he first inserted the tampon-like tool in, I was uncomfortable but fine, but OMG when the actual IUD went in it felt like a cramp on steroids and the pain was so unbearable I fainted.
31	925	Insertion was nowhere near as painful as I expected, just felt like a sharp cramp.
31	926	They inserted the speculum, then she did something that cause a pinch (not bad), she measured the uterus and that brought on a bad cramp but it was bearable, and then when they inserted the IUD it felt like a few strong cramps- I flinched but after that initial flinch I held it together.
31	927	It felt like the worst period cramp I've ever gotten +1 for like 30 seconds.
31	928	The insertion hurt for a whole 10 seconds and then following was a VERY bad cramp, sort of like it was doing a final adjustment into place.
31	929	The pain was like a very bad menstrual cramp.
31	930	I did cramp slightly but I was able to drive myself home.
31	931	When the IUD is being inserted it feels like a sharp period cramp for a whole 30 seconds and then it's over with.
31	932	Went and got lunch after and started to cramp about an hour insertion.
31	933	I typically cramp very bad on my period, but after getting Skyla especially after the insertion with the help of ibuprofen I did not cramp at all.
31	934	My np stabilized my cervix which felt like a hard, dull pinch followed by a cramp that faded away after about 10 seconds.
31	935	for me insertion was a beeeze, I literally basically felt nothing, no cramping whatsoever and have yet to cramp.
31	936	Insertion (for me) was a bad cramp that lasted no more than 5 seconds.
31	937	It was uncomfortable and felt like a minor period cramp for a total of less than one minute.
31	938	The insertion wasn't bad, just a big cramp.
31	939	I had a mild cramp after I was done with the insertion but that went away within hours.
31	940	It feels like a cramp but more pressure and pinch.
31	941	The procedure took about 5 minutes wasn't bad just felt like I really hard menstrual cramp.
31	942	I would bleed and cramp pretty bad after sex as well.
31	943	It was one of the easiest things I have ever had done and the worst pain (just an uncomfortable cramp) was when she used the tool to hold my cervix in place, the IUD itself was nothing after that pinch.
31	944	The insertion I was painful but the type of cramp you get the day before your period.
31	945	Afterwards I had dull cramp aches and some spotting.
31	946	As she was inserting the IUD it felt like the worst period cramp of my life, but was bearable.
31	947	I had my skyla inserted three days ago (February 15th, a lovely late Valentine's Day present) I knew the inserting and measuring weren't going to feel good and I was right but the pain was like a bad period cramp that lasts for maybe 30ish seconds.
31	948	Now I just cramp terribly all the time.
31	949	I'm not going to lie it was a very bizarre uncomfortable pain that felt like a severe period cramp but it was over before I knew it and I was able to drive home.
31	950	Inserting of the skyla was the worst cramp I have ever experienced and I have PCOS.
31	951	It literally just was a cramp that was a smidge more painful than I was use to.
31	952	I cramp and bleed a little for the first week after insertion, and after that it is smooth sailing.
31	953	When I had it inserted I didn't really feel bad pain I only felt a small cramp.
31	954	It was mostly uncomfortable getting it and a little cramp.
31	955	The insertion of the IUD was about as painful as a cramp.
31	956	The whole thing took 4 minutes tops and the pain (more like an intense pinching cramp) lasted maybe a half a minute.
31	957	From the insertion I was uncomfortable and the cramp was so painful.
31	958	The Dr said to expect a pinch and a cramp.
31	959	I just got the skyla put in a little over 4 weeks ago, I was not expecting to get it that day so I had not taken any meds, it was a bit uncomfortable but totally tolerable, just felt like a bad cramp.
31	960	I'd cramp worse than usual around ovulation.
31	961	The thing that I hate most about the birth control is I cramp all the time even when I'm not on my  The thing that I hate most about the birth control is I cramp all the time even when I'm not on my period ,  I have it a period All the time sometimes it's heavy sometimes a spotting.
31	962	It felt like a very severe period cramp.
31	963	I have yet to feel a cramp.
31	964	The insertion cramp was not that bad, and it went away after a second.
31	965	The insertion didn't last long and the worst of it felt like a pinching menstrual cramp lasting a couple seconds (once when they measure the uterus and once for insertion).
31	966	Insertion was painful but mostly was a really strong cramp.
31	967	I was super nervous & I had no idea what kind of pain to expect other than "severe menstrual cramp" feeling described.
31	968	It did hurt but the pain lasted for 5 seconds and was not sharp but like a really strong cramp.
31	969	I felt probably the worst cramp I've ever felt in my life for about two minutes and breathing very heavy as if I were going into labor.
31	970	The pain is like a severe period cramp.
31	971	Yes the first 6 weeks you cramp like a regular period and the getting it put in sucks.
31	972	There was a HUGE cramp after she measured my uterus & inserted the IUD, what I imagine a contraction feels like.
31	973	later on you might get sm  to med  sharp  pains that feel like when you get a period cramp.
31	974	if you can handle a period cramp you can handle this.
31	975	But once I got home I was told I'd cramp I did, and I also bled.
31	976	it was uncomfortable, but really just a pressured cramp.
31	977	I felt one small cramp when my doctor put the speculum in and zero pain after that.
31	978	The insertion felt like a very sharp cramp and lasted less than 30 seconds.
31	979	I would describe the experience as a severe cramp.
31	980	Feels like an extremely deep, painful period cramp that kinda takes your breath away for a second.
31	981	Also had a major cramp, that felt like when I got it inserted (only lasted 2 minutes, maybe).
31	982	I felt a slight period type cramp when she used the sound to measure my uterus, and then a another cramp when she inserted Skyla.
31	983	The cramp on both occasions did not last longer than thirty seconds.
31	984	I understand everyone is different, but the insertion process was nothing for me, slight cramp on measuring device but other then that couldn't feel a thing!
31	985	It almost feels like you're getting a bad cramp and you have to poop at the same time but it goes away in under a minute.
31	986	Also, when I have to poop really bad I'll start to cramp too, but once I go then they go away haha
31	987	I felt an intense period cramp for about 30 seconds and that's all I felt.
31	988	It hurt a lot but its like a bad cramp.
31	989	Insertion is painful but just like a really bad cramp last only a couple of seconds .
31	990	I felt like I was having a MILD period cramp, for about 30 seconds, and then I felt completely fine.
31	991	Now all I'm dealing with is light spotting and an occasional bad cramp.
31	992	The first part, which the doctor measures  your cervix, just feels like a bad menstrual cramp.
31	993	No bleeding Saturday, Sunday, or Monday with the occasional light cramp.
31	994	I still cramp horribly.
31	995	My doctor made me cough and it felt like a horrible cramp.
31	996	Insertion was fine- one mind numbing cramp but over pretty quickly, but I've always been pretty easy when it comes to periods and the like.
31	997	And for 30 second there was sharp pain, like a cramp mixed with a side stitch but in that area.
31	998	I didn't feel any pinch but I had a slow cramp from my vagina to my hips, back, and abdomen.
31	999	She then inserted the IUD which felt like a strong period cramp that only lasted for about 5 seconds.
31	1000	Also I've now had my period for 3 weeks and cramp and back pain.
31	1001	Almost no period at this point, still cramp during that time - but nothing that can't be managed.
31	1002	The measurement is the worst part and the insertion feels like a bad cramp but doesn't last long.
31	1003	While it didn't go in easily at first, it didn't cause more than about a minute of intense period cramp pain.
31	1004	It was nothing more than a period cramp sensation followed by a sharp pinch - all of lasting around 5-8 seconds.
31	1005	Insertion wasn't bad-if anything just a little cramp added to your normal pelvic exam.
31	1006	Removal was quick and practically painless other than a short cramp.
31	1007	Like a bad menstrual cramp and there was a sharp pinch.
31	1008	I've had what basically feels like a constant cramp since then, but nothing bad.
31	1009	Long story short, they put this tool in u to open up your vagina and it gives u a lot of pressure, then there were 2 pains beside the pressure one felt like some one had poked the insides of my vag with a needle and the other was a cramp.
31	1010	I felt intense pressure when she was measuring my cervix (it was 6cm), it was intense but bearable, and once she inserted the Iud, all I felt was a sharp period cramp.
31	1011	Only side affect for me is I cramp really bad for two days after inter course with my husband.
31	1012	Not a pinch, or a cramp, or anything at all!
31	1013	By the time I got home, I felt a hint of a cramp but was completely fine.
31	1014	I had a bad stomach cramp, during insertion, that is the type of cramp like you have to use the bathroom!
31	1015	I used to never cramp and now I feel terrible when I am about to start and start my period.
31	1016	The worst pain lasted about 10 seconds and it was just like a bad period cramp nothing to stress about.
31	1017	I was expecting the pain of insertion to be terrible, when in fact it felt like nothing more than a period cramp that lasted maybe about 5 seconds.
31	1018	My periods are much lighter now, and I don't cramp at all.
31	1019	The insertion pain wasn't that bad it was just like a really strong period cramp.
31	1020	I bleed and cramp everyday to the point where I want to go to the ER.
31	1021	The sounding was a cramp then the insertion like a two-step cramp (like *cramp*...pause...*cramp CRAMP*...done).
31	1022	It was the worst pain I had ever had, like an extreme period cramp for three days.
31	1023	It passes after a minute and it just feels like a regular menstrual cramp.
31	1024	The moment it opened, I yelped and felt the worst cramp of my life.
31	1025	I don't usually cramp on my period but I experienced cramping after the procedure.
31	1026	The insertion felt like a bad cramp, really not very painful at all.
31	1027	The cramp I had after the insertion was really bad though.
31	1028	It felt like a pap with a really bad cramp and then it was over.
31	1029	I did cramp for about a week after getting it, but it wasn't anything horrible, just slight discomfort.
31	1030	When they inserted it i swear the cramp is no joke but i mean they are messing with your uterus..Idk how girls do labor!!
31	1031	Insertion for me personally felt like a hardcore cramp , one like no other I had felt before but it was over quickly.
31	1032	The whole process was less than 2 mins & it just felt like an intense cramp briefly.
31	1033	I didn't cramp as bad as I did while on the pill.
31	1034	However, I did cramp like I was on my period.
31	1035	Inserting the device felt like a normal period cramp.
31	1036	Every so often I do get a sharp pain but it lasts no more than a minute and it feels like a bad cramp.
31	1037	Afterwards, I began to cramp and bleed lightly.
31	1038	It only felt like a cramp.
31	1039	I barely cramp, have the lightest periods, and forget it's there most of the time.
31	1040	I didnt cramp until about three hours after having it done.
31	1041	I also never cramp and whenever I did they were just slight cramping in my hips.
31	1042	(It was too late so I didn't take anything) my DR. Told me he was going to take a look at my cervix & honestly that was the most painful part (which wasn't even that  painful) It was like a very slight cramp.
31	1043	Little discomfort when I was being cleaned and prepped, the insertion of the device was the worst pain, feeling more like a strong contraction that just a period cramp.
31	1044	I felt a cramp but not worse than the ones I get before I'm about to start.
31	1045	You'll feel a sudden cramp.
31	1046	It felt like your worst period cramp x15.
31	1047	I took one 800mg Ibuprofen and a natural cramp reliever called
31	1048	Getting it put in felt like really bad cramp with a lot of pressure.
31	1049	I cramp once in a while.
31	1050	The insert was not that bad for me just a little cramping, but by the time I left the office it had stopped.
31	1051	It’s smaller meaning less cramping and easier on women who haven’t had any children!
31	1052	I spotted for 3-6 months and it was accompanied with  cramping and relieved with ibuprofen.
31	1053	The cramping lasted all day to the point where I felt like I could pass out from the pain (I have a high tolerance for pain).
31	1054	After the procedure, I experienced some cramping and pain for about 3 hours and then I was fine.
31	1055	My menstrual cycle during the last two months has been about 7-8 days instead of my usual 5 days, but much lighter bleeding and with less cramping than a typical period.
31	1056	I felt fine the next day and had some cramping while exercising over the next week or so.
31	1057	No cramping.
31	1058	I have had on and off cramping and bad back pain since then.
31	1059	That first day I had cramping, which you have to expect because it’s a foreign object in your body.
31	1060	For the first 3 months, I actually had more bleeding and more cramping.
31	1061	I’ve always had heavy periods with severe menstrual cramping, and this was by far the worst pain I’d ever experienced.
31	1062	After insertion, I️ experienced mild cramping for the rest of the day, but experienced sporadic, severe cramping for the first two months.
31	1063	Like, “knock the wind out of you, can’t walk or talk” cramping, and it would come and go in spontaneous waves.
31	1064	Those passed after the first 2 months and for the remaining 8, I️ experienced cramping maybe two or three times and it was when I️ got my period.
31	1065	I had been bleeding for two weeks with severe cramping, so I decided to go to the OBGYN.
31	1066	Sunday I woke up with bleeding, cramping and was very sick.
31	1067	The next week after that I was in extreme pain, cramping and everything.
31	1068	The insertion process was uncomfortable but not unbearable (I took 3 Aleve a couple hours prior, pretty severe cramping upon insertion for around 2 minutes, and then gradually subsided).
31	1069	However, the worst side effect I had was cramping during ovulation.
31	1070	I get very minimal cramping a few days before, and a light flow that lasts about 6 days.
31	1071	However, bad cramping started the next day and did not stop until I got my period a month later.
31	1072	I never experience random cramping and very rarely experience random light bleeding.
31	1073	I had been told I would feel some cramping during the procedure so I expected some pressure.
31	1074	Still cramping now (7pm).
31	1075	Any ways I figured after a couple days cramping would stop.
31	1076	On the 5th day (I'm traveling for a wedding so I'm on a plane) I started cramping so bad
31	1077	The cramping wasn't bad.
31	1078	Barely had any cramping afterwards.
31	1079	After it was over I cramped for 2-3 minutes and it is now almost 48 hours later and I have had no pain or cramping.
31	1080	The "worst' part was the cramping I experienced only for the first day.
31	1081	It was just uncomfortable and there was a lot of cramping and pressure but it was over in five minutes.
31	1082	After, I experienced very minor cramping and bleeding.
31	1083	I'm slightly cramping and no bleeding yet.
31	1084	After sex, I have cramping.
31	1085	I was able to drive myself home, no horrible cramping, etc.
31	1086	After having Skylar inserted 24 hrs ago, I'm still experiencing cramping like I would on the first day of my period, but its not going away with the heating pad.
31	1087	Since I got home I have had barely any cramping at all...just feels like the day or two before I start my period.
31	1088	The first step where they opened your cervix up a little and had a little thing hold your cervix in place caused cramping, but wasn't unbearable.
31	1089	I have had some light bleeding, but barely any cramping whatsoever.
31	1090	At first I thought I had Lyme disease (achey joints, vertigo, dizziness, severe fatigue, inability to lose weight, headaches, cramping) but now realize all these symptoms started after I got it put in.
31	1091	The first month was bad with pain and cramping, constipation, and diarrhea alternating, and constant nausea and fatigue.
31	1092	The second month my period barely showed up but I was stuck with all the cramping and spotting randomly.
31	1093	Right now the only thing thats really bugging me is cramping only when I'm trying to sleep.
31	1094	Got Skylar inserted yesterday, the pain wasn't too bad, stopped pains within a minute after it was inserted, was strong enough to get up and walk out afterward, since it's in the bleeding stopped immediately after the procedure, since then I've gotten no bleeding what so ever, but I can feel cramping but not to bad, I am happy I got Skylar :)
31	1095	Still occasionally cramping, but better.
31	1096	I took 4 ibuprofen beforehand and got it done on my period like suggested, and now I only have what I would consider light cramping.
31	1097	Right now (3 hours after insertion) I'm lying on the couch with a heating pad and minor cramping.
31	1098	As long as the cramping dies down after a couple of days, I think I will be in love with this form of birth control.
31	1099	I bled for maybe a couple days if that and had minimal cramping.
31	1100	The symptoms I experienced after were mild cramping a few hours after insertion, light bleeding for about a day, and nausea a couple days later.
31	1101	entire 7th month I've had pretty intense cramping of what feels like my cervix.
31	1102	In fact, this week has been the worst cramping yet, not sure what to think.
31	1103	I had mild cramping over the next month, and decent amount of bleeding.
31	1104	I took pain medicine beforehand, and have not had any cramping.
31	1105	The slightest cramping for maybe 10 seconds twice during a 5 minute time period.
31	1106	I experienced some cramping which was very bad around my first period.
31	1107	The cramping is very painful right now.
31	1108	I've had mild sporadic cramping and been spotting for a few weeks.
31	1109	It was ten seconds of serious cramping and then I was fine.
31	1110	Mild cramping after but nothing out of control, I actually even went camping that same day.
31	1111	I have little to no side effects except nipple and breast tenderness and some cramping before periods.
31	1112	The only downside is my period is longer than it was before (10 days, but not heavy) and I experience cramping, but nothing midol can't fix.
31	1113	After removal, I've been bleeding pretty steady the last few days and cramping which is supposedly normal.
31	1114	Every once in a while when I do get my period it's pretty light with some cramping  (average period I would say) for a week or less.
31	1115	The pain from the Skyla could be compared to my worst period cramping.)
31	1116	I get extra sensitive I guess during obvulation and periods as to the cramping and head and backaches.
31	1117	It hurts slightly when it get put in and then cramping for a day or two but then it's mostly bliss!
31	1118	My cramping is much more manageable than it used to be.
31	1119	I had cramping which lasted maybe 2 minutes.
31	1120	Insertion was painful to me - lots of intense pressure and cramping.
31	1121	This sharp pain and cramping cause immediate tears and a small yelp.
31	1122	Yes there is cramping but nothing unbearable at all.
31	1123	Once the cramping from insertion was over, I didn't have any side effects or problems.
31	1124	I had moderate cramping for a few days after insertion and am still spotting very lightly 2.5 weeks later.
31	1125	The first week was just annoying with the spotting and cramping.
31	1126	I'm 2 weeks in, and still spotting with random cramping.
31	1127	For the first 48 hours I have VERY mild cramping that easily went away with Advil and some spotting.
31	1128	I had the IUD for 5 months and it was not a pleasant experience, I had cramping that was severe even months after I got it put in, to the point I was hurled over.
31	1129	Do recommend taking the day off work since the cramping, while not unbearable, was pretty intense.
31	1130	My overall experience with the insertion was not bad to be honest I know everyone has a different pain tolerance and honestly I'm a wimp with pain but if you remember to take ibuprophen before hand and stay calm and positive, the worst part is the part where they measure the size of your uterus to be honest it felt like a piercing pain near my stomach and I felt cramping it lasted for less than a minute and then it was done you may feel light cramping afterwards but honestly it wasn't bad
31	1131	After the IUD was inserted I felt some mild cramping and was spotting for a couple of hours.
31	1132	Besides the cramping Skyla does its job!
31	1133	The next day I felt normal I had some light cramping and very light spotting.
31	1134	The cramping lasted exactly 7 days.
31	1135	Just had the Skyla inserted this afternoon, no pain or cramping during insertion or after so far.
31	1136	Other then the annoying side effects when it was inserted all I felt was cramping!
31	1137	no sharp pains or anything just minor cramping!
31	1138	Since insertion no serious cramping but the spotting is nonstop.
31	1139	Maybe it got put in wrong or maybe it's just how it works, but this pain is not worth it, It's made me lose my appetite due to cramping.
31	1140	But the cramping afterwards!!!!!
31	1141	Hot, sweating, cramping, lost all of my energy I couldn't even drive myself home.
31	1142	For me, the insertion felt pretty similar to period cramping.
31	1143	I have some cramping still but it is very manageable; I can get rid of it with a heating pad.
31	1144	As of now I feel light cramping and no bleeding plus vaginal discomfort like I have a UTI.
31	1145	It was very intense cramping for the process and 5 hours after.
31	1146	The removal was fast and only 30 seconds of cramping.
31	1147	AND I counted how long the severe cramping lasted during, and that was less than 20 seconds.
31	1148	My doctor had told me that I would feel some cramping but during and especially after I could not even breathe.
31	1149	The rest of the day I had extreme cramping.
31	1150	I just got Skyla this week but want to weigh in on the insertion process since I read mostly horror stories about the pain, bleeding, cramping, etc.
31	1151	I immediately felt some very faint cramping but it subsided completely after about 5 minutes.
31	1152	I'm ending my first week with Skyla and have had no cramping and only a bit of spotting here and there, but nothing crazy.
31	1153	I have had cramping since my procedure (some day its awful, some days manageable).
31	1154	Insertion was horrible for me because I have a retroverted uterus (which I find out at the insertion appointment) so the normal pain of insertion was amplified.. however, once it was in I only had some mild cramping and I was good to go.
31	1155	After it was over, she let me lay down for a little bit due to the cramping.
31	1156	Honestly it was about a 6/10 but the cramping wasn't the issue, it was more for the sharp insertion pain which lasted tops 30secs.
31	1157	When I woke up, the cramping had largely subsided and into the night I was almost normal.
31	1158	I had some cramping but nothing I wasn't use to.
31	1159	Fainting, vomiting, unreal cramping by the time I got to the car & whole first day.
31	1160	During the insertion I felt pain for like 30 seconds of cramping a bit.
31	1161	I took ibuprofen for 3 days for the semi cramping not severe at all.
31	1162	The insertion wasn't too bad, though today I had to miss school because of really painful cramping.
31	1163	Hopefully the cramping will go away sooner than later!
31	1164	Couple of hours later, still cramping but light bleeding.
31	1165	I had terrible cramping that day and the day after, but I only bled about 3 days once it was put in.
31	1166	Then the cramping afterward was so bad my boyfriend had to carry me out the door.
31	1167	The next day I was cramping some and bleeding a little bit and I took some ibuprofen and all was good.
31	1168	Overall, for a month of spotting and mild cramping for years of no babies?
31	1169	Once the false labor pain stopped, I had to be rushed to the hospital due to abdominal cramping so intense that I could barely move.
31	1170	I have had a series of problems with this since it was inserted including UTI daily, massive cramping, blood in my stool (recently since the kidney infection), painful sex, and even lost interest in sex.
31	1171	I'm still cramping 3 days later.
31	1172	the insertation was painful for maybe a minute then I had constant cramping for about a week but nothing ibuprofen and a heating pad couldn't take care of.
31	1173	The insertion was painful for about 30 seconds (really bad cramping).
31	1174	I do experience some bad cramping from time to time, mostly before my period and a few days after it stops, but after taking Midol or Aleve, it goes away.
31	1175	I got Skyla around August 2016- during insertion the pain felt like really bad cramping, my eyes did water near the end (I took a good amount of Ibuprofen) and I had SEVERE cramping/shooting paints after mostly on my left side.
31	1176	The first object placed was a ruler to measure the inside of the uterus, this was the most painful and caused intense cramping 7/10 pain.
31	1177	The intense cramping subsubsided immediately and i had mild cramping for another 6-7 hours.
31	1178	I am cramping but ibupfrofen takes care of it right away.
31	1179	I was anxious and nervous about the pain and cramping.
31	1180	I did experience some moderate cramping but that subsided after 30 seconds.
31	1181	I'm only on day 1 so I don't know what the next few days will hold but I'm expecting some cramping.
31	1182	The cramping did get better the next day and was completely gone in about 3 days.
31	1183	The cramping was painful and I was so glad I did it on a Friday.
31	1184	I had cramping the first day and some spotting.
31	1185	I had very light cramping couple days and then a 5 day period.
31	1186	I still have random intense cramping followed by spotting, but skyla is worth it.
31	1187	So I've had my IUD for almost 2 months I had cramping for a month.
31	1188	And to add on to it I can't feel my strings at all as well as have cramping now going in to have it removed.
31	1189	After experiencing nausea and cramping, I took two pregnancy tests which came back positive.
31	1190	Random and painful cramping.
31	1191	I've had Skyla for a year and three months; The insertion was painful and uncomfortable, I had some VERY light spotting, cramping, and a bit of nausea the first day, but by the following day I was absolutely fine.
31	1192	Unlike me, my sister had a better experience after her insertion and was cramping for 2 days and felt better after.
31	1193	I get random PAINFUL cramping that lasts about 10 seconds off and on.
31	1194	Not every day, and not when I'm on my period (normal cramping during that time).
31	1195	Insertion was painful but the cramping subsided within a day or so.
31	1196	Some minor cramping and a few pinches and pokes it was over.
31	1197	The first iud I had was the mirena which I had experienced sever sharp cramping in my right ovary which then the suspected was the one arm digging into my cervix.
31	1198	I had regular period-type cramping the next several days, which is to say at points distracting, but nothing horrible.
31	1199	Had cramping the rest of that day & part of the next, but that's it.
31	1200	My sex drive is back & I've had little/no cramping!
31	1201	First few months I had bad cramping, spotting, and a regular period for the most part.
31	1202	The first 6 months, I had horrible cramping, like I've never experienced before, and irregular unpredictable periods.
31	1203	My periods became more regular but still with uncomfortable cramping.
31	1204	There was cramping for a few days, and I had been due for my cycle the week after.
31	1205	Since the insertion I've had intense cramping and bleeding nonstop.
31	1206	I have slight cramping here in and there but it only last a few moments.
31	1207	Here's the down side my period last about 4 days and I am still bleeding now for 15 days and counting it was heavy during my period but now it's light bleeding and the off and on cramping is frustrating.
31	1208	For the first couple of months I don't really remember how my periods were, but starting in July I started getting them about every two weeks, with bad cramping the first couple of days and they're pretty heavy.
31	1209	This lasted about 30 minutes then steady cramping for 24-48 hours after.
31	1210	It only lasted 2 minutes tops and I just had severe cramping during those couple minutes which caused me to get very hot.
31	1211	I have had cramping since I've gotten it, along with on and off spotting.
31	1212	Please take a pain killer immediately if you feel any cramping.
31	1213	Every time I experience the cramping it makes me want to vomit and cry.
31	1214	When that time comes around I experience the same painful cramping but only for a couple days.
31	1215	Mild cramping.
31	1216	With horrible cramping 2-3 days.
31	1217	I did feel warm afterwards and I had cramping.
31	1218	I did not experience any pinching or cramping and almost decided not to get it because of all of the scary reviews.
31	1219	Besides my partner sometimes feeling the strings and some bleeding during sex, as well as some painful cramping from time to time it's been good.
31	1220	A little cramping but nothing out of the ordinary !
31	1221	When the procedure was done they had me lay on my side and I was turning pale and cramping alot afterwards.
31	1222	It's September 22 and I've been cramping and bleeding everyday since.
31	1223	The only down side is the cramping and bloating.
31	1224	The cramping is just the worst part.
31	1225	The first day you do have cramping but nothing tylenol cannot fix.
31	1226	I felt some cramping that day but it was nothing a little Tylenol couldn't fix.
31	1227	You should expect some cramping while your body becomes accustomed to it, remember the uterus is a flat cavity so there's gonna be some getting used too.
31	1228	There was severe cramping about an hour after it was inserted for the first time.
31	1229	No extra bleeding or cramping, and I feel fine.
31	1230	I had horrible cramping for the rest of the day but that was gone the next morning when I woke up.
31	1231	Since then I have had some light cramping here and there but nothing too bad.
31	1232	I was having horrible cramping and sharp pain.
31	1233	Afterwards for the next day or two you will feel cramping.
31	1234	Yes you do feel a bit of pressure and cramping but it's bearable.
31	1235	My last period lasted 12 days with heavy  and it's starting again 15 days later with terrible cramping.
31	1236	That evening I had some cramping but some ibuprofen and a heating pad took care of it.
31	1237	I haven't had any further cramping since and am only spotting a little bit.
31	1238	The rest of the first week was occasional sharp cramping.
31	1239	Less than a week out, and cramping is gone!
31	1240	Severe cramping occurred for 36-48 hours after insertion.
31	1241	I read so many stories and articles on this and was nervous but not as much as before cause it only seemed like a little bit of cramping during procedure.
31	1242	But other than that Im cramping as if Im on my period.
31	1243	Now as far as after goes, the cramping has been pretty gnarly since about 3 hours after the insertion took place.
31	1244	After it was inserted i had small cramping.
31	1245	No even on the level my period cramping is on.
31	1246	But the side effects of constant nausea and cramping is the worst.
31	1247	I need tips for how to get rid of the cramping because I'm having trouble sleeping now and nothing is working.
31	1248	I got the implant yesterday and yes there was some painful cramping but it wasn't enough to make me want to pass out or not drive home.
31	1249	I had cramping for 2 weeks and I spotted for a little over a month, but not heavily.
31	1250	The Skyla was painful & cramping followed apon insertion, however it subsided after a couple days.
31	1251	For the first 9 months I would get regular periods (not too heavy, not horrible cramping) and after that I either dont get a period,just the cramping and skip it or I will get a period with painful cramping.
31	1252	Light cramping and lethargic the rest of the day and went to bed early.
31	1253	I had some moderate cramping for a couple of days and slight spotting.
31	1254	At my 1 week mark, I was having heavy cramping and some sharp pain.
31	1255	It just felt like some deep cramping for a few minutes during the insertion.
31	1256	Since then I have been cramping every day pretty badly and have had bad headaches on and off.
31	1257	No cramping no ache no weight gain.
31	1258	My period has been like clockwork the past 8 months, and are light and last about 4 days, with little to no cramping at all.
31	1259	I couldn't help but cry as I felt cramping and felt the T seem to open up inside my uterus.
31	1260	Luckily it did but the cramping and gas afterwards was bad..
31	1261	As many of you I had cramping after it was in but mine went away after a DAT or two.
31	1262	I don't get cramping nearly as much anymore maybe once or twice in a few months.
31	1263	When it was put in I had major cramping right after and it lasted for a few hours.
31	1264	It's very quick and then pretty bad cramping for the next 30 minutes to an hour.
31	1265	I read the reviews beforehand and was prepared for cramping and possible dizziness.
31	1266	I've had occasional cramping since the procedure, but no spotting.
31	1267	I had high hopes because cramping that day was minimal.
31	1268	No cramping ever, periods are lighter.
31	1269	As of now, minimal bleeding, zero cramping, no problems or complaints here!!
31	1270	For about 48 hours after, I had pretty significant cramping, but ibuprofen every few hours definitely took the edge off.
31	1271	I had light spotting for about the next week, but since that has ended I've had no cramping and no bleeding!
31	1272	So far minimal cramping and I was just slightly dizzy after it.
31	1273	I had some very light cramping later that night and a light headache the next day and I have seemed to lost my appetite but that's it.
31	1274	Honestly the pain lasted 2 mins tops however I did have a little bit of cramping the next day.
31	1275	I did get light headed and had cramping of various intensity come and go the rest of the night, but nothing I haven't felt before during a period.
31	1276	Ive only had mild cramping today, but I'm also on my period so I believe it's just a combination of those factors.
31	1277	I had spotting for the first couple of weeks with extremely harsh cramping.
31	1278	The cramping has subsided, only arising around the time when I am on my cycle.
31	1279	I am still very mildly cramping and it's 3 days later.
31	1280	I am still cramping very bad.
31	1281	After 6 months i stopped bleeding all together just w/ severe cramping throughout the month.
31	1282	My cramping never got better it is actually worse than before but atleast I don't deal with bleeding too.
31	1283	I had lots of cramping afterwards for 2 weeks & on & off spotting for the first 3 months but that's all gone now.
31	1284	I am on day 4 of having skyla and have been cramping all day.
31	1285	It's only been in a day and I'm having really bad cramping and headaches.
31	1286	I can't feel the iud, have zero cramping or spotting now and am so happy.
31	1287	The whole thing was over in 2-3 minutes and I had almost no cramping.
31	1288	It hurt a little bit and I felt slight cramping after the insertion but nothing too crazy.
31	1289	The insertion was fairly painful, some very intense cramping that lasted about 3 days.
31	1290	Lately I have noticed cramping and pressure during intercourse, which is worse during certain positions and has basically made me not want to have sex anymore.
31	1291	And I occasionally experience cramping still.
31	1292	I did have cramping the first day that made me a bit nauseous but ultimately ended up feeling well enough to have intercourse that night.
31	1293	I had to call in sick from severe period like cramping.
31	1294	Occasional period like cramping, nothing that Advil can't help.
31	1295	It was about 30 seconds of pressure and cramping, not so much pain just a weird feeling.
31	1296	I had some cramping that day, but felt fine the next day.
31	1297	There was some minor cramping over the course of the week, but that has since subsided.
31	1298	The insertion definitely hurt and I had slight cramping the first day of insertion, but it was completely gone by the second day.
31	1299	Im constantly cramping and in pain.
31	1300	I had consistent spotting and cramping.
31	1301	The cramping eased off after 2 days but it wasnt the end.
31	1302	Afterwards, I've only had minor cramping that would be the same as it is on my period.
31	1303	I had some cramping afterwards but nothing too severe.
31	1304	The cramping lasts about 3 days which heating pad and Motrin has helped a bit.
31	1305	I have lost at least 1/3 of my hair and started having really bad cramping and abdominal pain.
31	1306	I experienced the worst cramping of my life with this IUD, at times nearly bringing me to tears.
31	1307	I would have cramping with things like working out and after intercourse, and also at random times.
31	1308	It seemed as though the spotting was starting to get better, but the intense, severe cramping persisted so my GYN agreed that it should be removed.
31	1309	During insertion I experienced the worst cramping I've ever felt & I got hot sweats & almost passed out.
31	1310	That night I took about 400 mg of Ibuprofen because I didn't know if it would cause cramping.
31	1311	I got it put in 3/09/16 and now that it's 4/30/16 I haven't stopped spot bleeding or cramping.
31	1312	I haven't even been cramping after.
31	1313	I still felt cramping a while after and the pain was so bad that they put me in a different room in order to sleep off the pain.
31	1314	The insertion was very painful but quick about 5 min, I had some moderate cramping few days after but nothing serious.
31	1315	I was on the depo shot for several years and experienced pretty severe weight gain but had no periods, light occasional cramping.
31	1316	So far, I've had absolutely no periods, no spotting and no cramping.
31	1317	I still have other PMS tupe symptom like irribility and slight cramping...
31	1318	No cramping or pain at all afterwards.
31	1319	I would rate it about 2/10 on a pain scale, and the "pain" is pressure and mild cramping
31	1320	The only plus side is that I am not pregnant but that's only because I can't have sex due to the long periods and weird cramping and discharge.
31	1321	I did take the day off to recover, had to use a heat pad to relieve some severe cramping about 20 minutes later, but by the end of the day I was taking the dog for a walk :)
31	1322	I can say I was extremely freaked out at first but afterwards I was fine and had some mild cramping and bleeding.
31	1323	Like a 9/10 for me, felt dizzy, I was shaking, cramping, crying, and bleeding after insertion.
31	1324	Afterward I had no cramping, or bleeding.
31	1325	This followed with a night full of intense cramping and heavy (to me) bleeding, I took another 2 or 3 Advil .
31	1326	I had no side effects aside from light cramping for about 6 days.
31	1327	I actually didn't even feel any cramping until today (9 days after insertion).
31	1328	Did anyone else have a delay in the onset of cramping or is that just me?
31	1329	Within the 30 minutes after insertion I threw up 3x & felt the need to just lay down but literally right after that i was fine...just mild cramping.
31	1330	I took 3 Aleve pills once I felt cramping (6/10) *aleve is a life saver for cramps* I continued to take the Aleve pills till day 3 and on day 4 I felt light cramping and started noticing a light lower back pain when laying down.
31	1331	I did yoga about 2 hours after insertion and it helped eliminate ALL of the cramping.
31	1332	I did experience bleeding at first then spotting and a bit of cramping but not bad at all compared to the periods I experienced.
31	1333	I had severe cramping for the first 24 hours.
31	1334	I barely had any cramping and it's day three and i feel amazing!!!
31	1335	It's not just a small pinch especially if your cervical is small like mine it will hurt and after the pain is terrible bad cramping .
31	1336	The cramping pain level is 8-10 depending on you .
31	1337	Cramped with mirena for weeks but only experienced slight cramping with skyla and overall feel like it has had less side effects.
31	1338	I've been with it for almost a year now and I'm still getting the constant cramping.
31	1339	I had some pretty severe cramping for the next few hours, but was still able to work.
31	1340	Since then, my cycle has been fairly regular (about every 30 days) with barely any cramping.
31	1341	Bad side effects: cramping is very random and almost on a daily basis.
31	1342	My periods were light and very little cramping.
31	1343	I also experience horrible cramping about 5 days before.
31	1344	On a scale from 1-10, the cramping was a 7 the 1st day.
31	1345	I went back and got an ultrasound to check the placement and was informed I had a irritated cyst and that it would go away..here I am 6 months later every 2 weeks I get insane cramping and a week long period.
31	1346	I was sweaty and tired but it was done but ok. 1 month in lots of sharp sudden cramping and intense lower back ache sporadically.
31	1347	I felt some light cramping but nothing painful.
31	1348	I had pretty severe cramping that night but it wasn't anything a few ibuprofen couldn't take care of.
31	1349	I got skyla in September of 2015 and the procedure was relatively painless just some slight cramping during the measurement of my uterus.
31	1350	I started having heat waves and extreme cramping.
31	1351	Immediately after I was ok, but the cramping kicked in while driving home and I spent the night taking ibuprofen and using a hot water bottle on the couch.
31	1352	The cramping subsided over the next few days and I know get short ones every once and awhile as I still adjust.
31	1353	I felt cramping and a pinching pain, but in all, the discomfort lasted about 20 seconds.
31	1354	Afterwards, I felt mild cramping, but I feel no pain at all 6 hrs later.
31	1355	I laid there for about 25 mins feeling sick and having terrible cramping.
31	1356	Mild cramping for the first few days and then for the next week (lessened over time).
31	1357	I was in horrible (cramping) pain for about 3-4 hours after.
31	1358	I give it another month of this horrible cramping!
31	1359	I had a lot of cramping for the next hour but it was tolerable.
31	1360	Today I feel much better, but I am still experiencing slight cramping.
31	1361	Still have some spotting and cramping 5 days later.
31	1362	Long story short, I bled for 4 straight months (very light, more like bloody discharge than actual period) and the cramping has been intermittent, but incapacitating (drop to the floor) when it hits.
31	1363	I started spotting and cramping horribly for the next 2 months pretty much every day, but my doctor said everything was fine.
31	1364	Getting home the cramping had me doubled over in pain.
31	1365	The cramping continued randomly.
31	1366	After 4 months I got it taken out and immediately the cramping went away.
31	1367	I had some cramping and headaches for the first 48 hours post procedure, but woke up today feeling great!
31	1368	She poked around down there and I just felt pressure and cramping.
31	1369	I've felt fine since, aside from some minor cramping.
31	1370	I did not experience cramping but I do have spotting.
31	1371	So I've had the iud inserted sometime in November a little before thanksgiving and I've had serious serious bleeding and lots of bad cramping, days where I'm not even able to get out of bed!
31	1372	no cramping, no bleeding nothing the Pap smear was more uncomfortable but that's just me.
31	1373	I used to have painful, heavy periods, but now I spot for about 5 days each month, and only feel mild cramping on the first day (no medication necessary!)
31	1374	The discomfort only lasted a minute and the cramping and pinching only came when they dilated my cervix (about 30 seconds).
31	1375	I had someone drive me home and I have normal first-day-of-period cramping.
31	1376	I did have heavier cramping afterwards for about a day, but overall I am happy with the IUD.
31	1377	Yes, there was some cramping and a little bleeding, but nothing an ibuprofen and little panty liner couldn't handle.
31	1378	I started cramping horribly as soon as it started and actually started yelling "I can't do this, I can't do this."
31	1379	after the insertion I got white in my face, hot, and uncomfortable because my cramping was awful.
31	1380	I had mild cramping as my body adjusted but afterwards I could hardly tell it was there.
31	1381	I went from having mild cramping to heavier cramping and increased flow.
31	1382	The cramping pain was immediate.
31	1383	After the insertion,  I was cramping so bad and the pain was so bad,  I could not stop crying.
31	1384	When you consider that Skyla works for three years, a month of a little spotting and minor cramping seems worth it to me.
31	1385	I had my Skyla inserted this morning and let me not scare anymore but understand it is the most simple procedure however you will feel 30 seconds of either extremely bad cramping or unbearable pain and then it's over.
31	1386	Also get more painful cramping during PMS and the first couple days of my period.
31	1387	Had cramping for 20 days until I got my first period after insertion.
31	1388	Just woke up, have the same cramping, spotting, and, alot of gas.
31	1389	The insertion hurt pretty badly and I was cramping and bleeding for about a month afterwards.
31	1390	I will say that the day I had the procedure I thought I was going to be able to go into work but the cramping was so bad for about 3 hours after the procedure I wasn't able to do anything except lay on the couch with a heating pad!
31	1391	But ever since that cramping subsided I have been 100% normal.
31	1392	When I got home I did experience heavier cramping.
31	1393	Woke up this morning with no cramping and minimal spotting.
31	1394	Immediately after the doc took out the tools the cramping disappeared.
31	1395	I have terrible cramping, I even stayed home from class sometimes because of the pain.
31	1396	I've had maybe 4 days of horrible cramping since I got it inserted.
31	1397	My second month was better in cramping (little to none) and a week of bleeding with two days in between where I did not bleed at all.
31	1398	I don't feel cramping unless I am on my period but it was only got 3 days max.
31	1399	The whole day after I had extreme cramping, but it slowly went away and did not continue into the next day.
31	1400	There was very light cramping for 30 min and now I am spotting but no other effects so far!
31	1401	I took Advil half an hour before the procedure and had very little cramping after.
31	1402	I will admit the first time we had sex, I did get a little cramping but other than that, I've been fine and love it!
31	1403	I have had absolutely no cramping or spotting after my iud insertion.
31	1404	Yes there was a tiny bit of cramping which lasted about 8 seconds and my Dr warned me right before it was to happen.
31	1405	I had no cramping or pain after a little bit of spotting that evening and that was it.
31	1406	So far pretty pleased with the IUD itself, good sex drive, my mood swings have completely decreased, overall very very happy I got it, the only downside it random cramping that can be pretty uncomfortable but there's usually a few months after starting a birth control where your body adjusts so hoping they stop soon.
31	1407	I had some cramping after insertion but wasn't anything to bad have had very light periods and I'm starting to lose weight!
31	1408	I was on my period and already cramping so maybe that's why it was like a nightmare to me.
31	1409	Once it was inserted I had passed out but when I woke up in could feel my uterus cramping and when it did all my muscles would shake.
31	1410	I usually have moderate cramping with periods, but this was just slight cramping in my lower abdomen & only lasted for about 1 1/2 minutes of the procedure.
31	1411	It's been about 6hrs & I haven't had any spotting yet or cramping.
31	1412	The insertion wasn't bad, it was a lil uncomfortable, lot of pressure, and a mild cramping feeling.
31	1413	No pain for the rest of the day though, only light spotting & no cramping for the first week.
31	1414	Terrible cramping for the first 2 days but no more pills for me!
31	1415	It barely hurt just mild cramping and a tiny bit of pressure.
31	1416	I had many bad side effects.. Bad cramping, mood swings, I slouched a lot while I was cramping and there were times where I wasn't able to move or else it'll start hurting more.
31	1417	Out of the 42 days I've had it, I would say I experienced cramping for at least 25 days and spotting for probably 30.
31	1418	The cramping pain and bleeding didn't stop for about two months and periods are still extremely painful.
31	1419	So, now I am two days after insertion and still have mild cramping.
31	1420	I am about 6 months in and I've had extreme cramping every time for two weeks.
31	1421	I had the Mirana IUD put in after I had my 1st son in 2011, after about 1 year of having it I had it taken out because of the cramping and losing so much hair.
31	1422	I had mild cramping for the next several days and no spotting.
31	1423	The rest of the day my cramping peaked at a 6 on the pain scale and subsided each day after.
31	1424	No spotting, period was on time with minimal cramping.
31	1425	When I got home I felt extremely sick; I was nauseous, cramping bad, and had moderate bleeding.
31	1426	I had my pap before the insertion and that was its usual pain but I will say the cramping from "the pinch" killed me.
31	1427	It's been about 3 hours now and I still have minor cramping that feels like a regular period.
31	1428	I have absolutely no cramping and the bleeding has pretty much stopped.
31	1429	Several of my friends, with and without children, have Mirena and almost everyone told me it was no big deal, a little cramping, etc.
31	1430	Afterwards there was very mild cramping (2 out of 10) on and off for a few hours, but then nothing!
31	1431	I hope in this next month the spotting and mild cramping goes away!
31	1432	I bled quite a bit and had heavy cramping the rest of the day.
31	1433	I'm still cramping 4 days later, although not as bad.
31	1434	I don't remember having the cramping and bleeding as bad after the Mirena.
31	1435	After the procedure I was fine until I started cramping about 1 hr.
31	1436	Now I just feel mild cramping.
31	1437	I'm now on day two don't have any side effects besides mild cramping and light spotting.
31	1438	Insertion did hurt but not as bad as I thought it would and it was quick, very little cramping afterwards.
31	1439	I spotted with little to no cramping for the first 2- 3 days and got my period a couple days later as well.
31	1440	3.5 weeks later I have started cramping and bleeding lightly again - my period is not due for another 6 days so I'm unsure if my cycle has changed or if it's breakthro
31	1441	I've now had it for 3 weeks & my side affects are random bleeding, light cramping & unusual tiredness.
31	1442	There was some cramping during the insertion but other than that, it wasn't much worse than having a pap smear done.
31	1443	2nd day - less cramping.
31	1444	I had cramping for the next day or two but nothing terrible.
31	1445	Every once in a while I will get some cramping that lasts 30 minutes.
31	1446	5 days later slight cramping, but I'm okay!
31	1447	However, I'm a big girl and it's perhaps twice as painful as my normal menstrual cramping and I'd rather have that once a month than a child I'm not ready for.
31	1448	I had some major cramping but nothing i am not already use too.
31	1449	However 30 to 45 minutes later I started to have extreme discomfort and cramping.
31	1450	It's been a few hours and all I feel is very mild cramping, nothing some Tylenol won't help.
31	1451	I went in expecting some pain and cramping and that is exactly what I got.
31	1452	After 5 minutes, I did still have cramping but was able to drive home.
31	1453	I made my appointment before work thinking I would just have some mild cramping (I can take pain).
31	1454	During the procedure, (which only lasted about 10 minutes) I felt mild cramping and a little discomfort due to the utensils going past my cervix.
31	1455	I had Skyla inserted yesterday and there was very mild cramping but it was really not very painful.
31	1456	It was no worse than a little pressure and cramping!
31	1457	The cramping has continued on and off for the past 12 hours, but nothing overly intense!
31	1458	I had lots of cramping, soreness, bloating, fatigue and a bit of a fever.
31	1459	Can't walk without cramping up still.
31	1460	There was cramping off and on in the beginning and there is still spotting(5 weeks), but I have no side effects and feel great.
31	1461	When I did finally leave the office, I had close to unbearable cramping all afternoon.
31	1462	Six weeks after I'm still spotting & cramping, I'm losing hair, anxiety, sore bones, suicidal, depression for no reason other than this device.
31	1463	Do expect cramping for a day or two.
31	1464	Very mild cramping today but I am happy with my choice :)
31	1465	I've had Skyla in for a little over a year now and although there is cramping that comes with it I would definitely recommend it!
31	1466	The first few weeks I had very bad cramping, but after my first period with it in the cramping went away.
31	1467	During the weeks of the cramping I was also very emotional.
31	1468	I get cramping around my periods but nothing that is bad, best part is that my periods are SO much lighter!
31	1469	I bled the next day with moderate cramping.
31	1470	The pamphlets said cramping would last about 30 minutes but this is false.
31	1471	I have had spotting ever since insertion (10 days ago) but no other side effects and cramping was done after two days.
31	1472	Afterwards it was just regular menstrual cramping.
31	1473	The cramping subsided after about 3 hours after the procedure.
31	1474	No cramping or bleeding after that evening.
31	1475	I'm on day two and I have slight cramping and light spotting.
31	1476	The cramping lasted for about an hour it felt like pre- cycle cramping or first day cramping.
31	1477	After it was done I had mild cramping for an hour then nothing.
31	1478	The process itself was not comfortable and involved some pain, but afterwards I had a couple hours of slight cramping and then I was fine!
31	1479	My period prior would last for more than 7 with severe cramping.
31	1480	After I left I took another motrin in hopes to avoid any cramping, I felt a little weird at first kind of delicate I suppose but nothing horrible.
31	1481	He prescribed me 550 mg naproxen for the cramping.
31	1482	I cramped up so bad I had to lay there on the table for about five minutes in tears before I was able to move and then had cramping for several hours following the procedure.
31	1483	No cramping or bleeding the day of or day after.
31	1484	I did have some cramping the first month that was slight.
31	1485	So many people said insertion was ridiculously painful and that cramping lasted for days afterwards.
31	1486	I have had very minor cramping for the rest of the day but nothing significant and I only took 2 aleve tabs an hour prior to insertion.
31	1487	A lot of cramping, dizziness and nausea.
31	1488	It was inserted and I experienced heavy cramping.
31	1489	I'm twenty years old and generally experience very painful cramping during my periods.
31	1490	My doctor said the that usually it hurts more when you haven't had a baby before, the cramping feels like a slight contraction, that's what he described it as.
31	1491	Today is day 2 with it and I feel cramping for a few seconds come and go.
31	1492	He said I will feel cramping as my body adjusts to it.
31	1493	So far so good, other than the placement and the cramping, I have seem to lost my appetite.... im the type that would eat every 20 minutes and as soon as It was placed my sense of hunger was gone.
31	1494	I'm not sure if it has to do with the cramping or the IUD but hopefully it stays like
31	1495	Since insertion I have had severe cramping, spotting and moodiness.
31	1496	I had cramping for several days afterwards and that went away.
31	1497	I took 800mg of ibuprofen before it to offset the cramping.
31	1498	I used to get horrible periods, 7days of bleeding and cramping requiring 800mg of ibuprofen around the clock.
31	1499	The first two months with he skyla I experienced cramping and bleeding just about everyday.
31	1500	At the end of month 2 the bleeding and cramping subsided.
31	1501	The placement wasn't too painful but the cramping afterward was pretty rough.
31	1502	Felt like some severe period cramping, but nothing that was unbearable!
31	1503	I had waves of cramping throughout the rest of the day, took a little nap, but was able to go grocery shopping and even went out in the evening with no problem.
31	1504	Felt mild cramping throughout the week.
31	1505	The cramping was pretty severe immediately after the procedure and for the next couple days, so I suggest having someone drive you to and from the procedure.
31	1506	It hurt but I've also gotten a few colposcopy (cervix biopsy) before, so I would compare it to that but a LITTLE more 'pinchy' & crampy.
31	1507	The insertion was crampy pain (bearable but uncomfortable) but quick and I had no side effects immediately after and got up and left normally.
31	1508	I was crampy the rest of that period.
31	1509	I've been pretty crampy and have had minimal spotting (both are normal).
31	1510	After I felt crampy but nothing bad and I am pretty satisfied right now.
31	1511	After however I felt nauseous and crampy the entire day.
31	1512	3 days later, I was still extremely crampy, nasueous & dizzy.
31	1513	I was crampy for a few days but nothing ibuprofen couldn't fix.
31	1514	It was uncomfortable & I felt slightly crampy for about a week, nothing an Advil or two couldn't fix.
31	1515	Really crampy, but tolerable.
31	1516	The whole application process was just crampy although one of the applicators opened prematurely right in my cervix which caused a little pain (My doctor said she hadn't ever seen that before) Overall, don't let people with low pain tolerances affect your decision about getting Skyla.
31	1517	I am crampy but ok.
31	1518	I was crampy all that day and the next day.
31	1519	Overall the procedure is quick but painful I would say the pain for me lasted about 15 seconds [taking measurements, dilating me, and inserting the Skyla] It is a crampy pain followed by a sharp pinch.
31	1520	Not unbearable or teeth clenching, just awkward and crampy.
31	1521	We're now into the next morning and I feel more crampy but its manageable.
31	1522	It was sharp and crampy.
31	1523	I was better a few hours later but still crampy.
31	1524	I had tried implanon (made me crazy), paraguard (made me crampy and I felt it during intercourse) and mirena (I felt it during intercourse) so I was pretty much out of options when this came along.
31	1525	Insertion of skyla was simple, though a little crampy, but the doctor has to clamp your cervix so of course that's not going to be comfortable.
31	1526	Eventually spotting stopped.
31	1527	It was heavy the first 5 days and then light spotting the remainder of the time.
31	1528	The only warning my gyno gave me was that I would be spotting for about 15 days after having the IUD inserted, which was a damn lie.
31	1529	My uterus chilled for two weeks before I started spotting again.
31	1530	I then became frustrated because this irregular spotting was now interfering with my sex life.
31	1531	Anyways I've had mine in for about a month and a half I am spotting but so far I lOVE IT!!!
31	1532	I had light spotting for about a month and have not had a single period or spotting since.
31	1533	Very light spotting until my second day already having it.
31	1534	My sex drive returned (had issues with taking estrogen with drive) in just two weeks and my periods have gotten shorter and lighter each month and currently I am only spotting.
31	1535	The only negative thing for myself is the spotting.
31	1536	I also have been spotting a lot but I know it's normal and will probably stop within the next few months.
31	1537	I had some light spotting the next week and now when my period is supposed to come I may have a little extra discharge but nothing else.
31	1538	After three months of spotting my period became normal.
31	1539	Just a little spotting afterwards but nothing today.
31	1540	For the first 5 months, I bled constantly, after that it was spotting.
31	1541	I had severe pain for the rest of the week with very light spotting.
31	1542	It's been 4 months and the spotting has stopped.
31	1543	I thought it might be possibly going away but it just seems to be spotting more here and there, it could also be because of my weight training at the gym as well.
31	1544	By the end of the first week they became tolerable, but I was still spotting.
31	1545	Although my problem is, after I got mine put in (mind you I just bled for 3 weeks cause I just had a kid) I bled for another 3 freaking weeks, then I spotted for about a week finally stopped and now I'm spotting again.
31	1546	I've had spotting 2 days since insertion and never got my period.
31	1547	Also; no spotting or bleed after insertion.
31	1548	The week before I get the spotting I have extreme cravings and gain like five pounds and then lose it all right away from barely eating the week I spot.
31	1549	I have had a few days of spotting but just used a panty liner cause it wasn't even that bad!
31	1550	I have not had any spotting but I have also been on birth control pills for almost 10 years so I don't really get a period anyway.
31	1551	I took the rest of my day lying in bed with a hot pad and bled for 2 days (spotting) 5 days after zero pain zero bleeding and sex!
31	1552	I have some spotting but it is very tolerable and manageable.
31	1553	My periods were pretty heavy and I kept bleeding for about 5 months straight just light bleeding and spotting until I started my period.
31	1554	In the last three months I haven't been spotting at all which has been nice!
31	1555	I get my period maybe every 3-4 months (light spotting for about 2 days tops).
31	1556	The only annoyance so far is a little spotting from the procedure.
31	1557	I've also been very lightly spotting for 2 weeks & it just stopped 2 days ago.
31	1558	Haven't had any side effects besides constant spotting like I haven't stopped bleeding since the insertion, its March 25th so I've had additional bleeding for a week and half going on two weeks.
31	1559	After that, my period would come for about 10 days with a combination of bleeding and spotting.
31	1560	I still am spotting which is kind of annoying but overall, I'm really happy with this.
31	1561	Very little spotting the next few days.
31	1562	Bleeding has ranged from light to barely even spotting but my period tends to last a week so it may just be from that.
31	1563	I experienced spotting for the first two months, but once the spotting and the pain went away it was amazing!
31	1564	A few hours later I have a little spotting and feel tender/crampy.
31	1565	I have had no spotting whatsoever.
31	1566	I have been bleeding since I got it (16 days) but it's been more like light spotting after my period.
31	1567	I also am ALWAYS spotting or on my period.
31	1568	I had spotting for about a month (until after my first period with skyla).
31	1569	I had brown spotting after (doctor said this is normal).
31	1570	I had a little bit of spotting, but I was also on my period.
31	1571	Anyway, I still get my period but it's just spotting, almost like when you're period is ending.
31	1572	I had a little spotting within the first few hours but after that I stopped bleeding.
31	1573	some spotting afterwards nothing much been in for 5 months and no issues yet i get some pain in my right ovary i think its when i would be having my period but i dont get them anymore just mood swings sore breast and ovary pain but no bleeding.
31	1574	It was inserted a few days before the start of my period and my period came on time and after a month or so of on and off spotting I don't get my periods as regularly.
31	1575	I had spotting the first few months then it finally dwindled down to no spotting or periods at all.
31	1576	I had minor spotting first month.
31	1577	Up til 4 days ago, I was spotting so had to wear a pad liner/light tampon.
31	1578	I get spotting once a month.
31	1579	As far as bleeding goes I had very light spotting for the first 2 weeks and then my period started and I've been on my period for 10 days now.
31	1580	I have also had spotting every day which is normal.
31	1581	No spotting, no emotional moods, no weight gain.
31	1582	I had spotting the entire time, which I knew was expected, but the most horrific side effect was hair loss.
31	1583	I can't really say if I've had spotting or not since I got my period a day after insertion.
31	1584	Some days I have spotting, others nothing at all.
31	1585	Since then I have had very light periods usually ONCE every 3 months with thick, bloody discharge on the first day and light spotting for 1-2 days after for a total of 3 days.
31	1586	i just had my skyla inserted about 3 weeks ago, ever since then i've been spotting non-stop & three days ago i started bleeding super heavy like if i was peeing myself and i haven't stop bleeding since, feels miserable when never before the skyla my period was this heavy & the horrible feeling of knowing that at any moment i can stain my pants coause its that heavy.
31	1587	I decided to keep my Skyla and give it time because I'm only 20 and I would rather have some light spotting and uneasy emotions than a child.
31	1588	I went back in for my 1 month check up I said that spotting only lasted 4 days.
31	1589	I had been spotting and then had the heaviest period of my life and am still spotting.
31	1590	And I haven't had any bleeding for spotting since!
31	1591	I have now had it for 3 weeks, and still have light spotting along with slight moodiness.
31	1592	No more spotting, and then 2 weeks later I got my period like normal.
31	1593	I NEVER went through the weeks and months of spotting like some other girls did.
31	1594	I had spotting off and on for a week then it stopped.
31	1595	I was constantly in pain, spotting all the time, and never felt good.
31	1596	I've had one period and some spotting.
31	1597	I've been spotting ever since though.
31	1598	I was spotting before I got it inserted, and yesterday it got kind of worse but today it has lightened.
31	1599	At first I was lightly spotting, but after a month my bleeding completely stopped.
31	1600	I no longer get my period but will have random spotting that has basically ruined all of my panties.
31	1601	After awhile, the pain was less frequent but I experienced somewhat heavy spotting for months.
31	1602	However the spotting is quite consistent (even still) and when it's not spotting I have a brownish discharge.
31	1603	The first 3-4 months i didnt get my period and when i did it was light spotting for a few days.
31	1604	I've only had very light spotting after exercise otherwise nothing.
31	1605	I did not have any spotting over the next month.
31	1606	Since then, my only complaint is the constant spotting.
31	1607	Since I made the switch my cycles are about the same length of days its always been, maybe a day or two longer, but mostly spotting.
31	1608	Mirena cause me to have spotting for about 2-3 weeks, same with Nexplanon...so I made the switch to Skyla.
31	1609	For about 2 months after the insertion, I had constant spotting, which was pretty annoying.
31	1610	I've been spotting since inserted but had one week without.
31	1611	Started my period last week and it's just been light, almost like spotting (very very annoying).
31	1612	Hoping the spotting stops soon so I can stop wearing pads.
31	1613	I've had light spotting for 3 months which makes it difficult to have intercourse with my boyfriend.
31	1614	Then got my period again but finally spotting subsided after my normal period.
31	1615	My periods now are much lighter than before.. spotting for the first two days, then two days of regular bleeding, and then another 2 to three days of spotting.
31	1616	I've yet to have spotting.
31	1617	My first period with it inserted lasted ten days but most of it was light spotting.
31	1618	I also continued to have my period every month, as well as spotting.
31	1619	I hardly get my period; light spotting.
31	1620	I'm still spotting a little bit but nothing too bad.
31	1621	Post insertion I had a lot of spotting for the first 2 weeks got a little annoying , but stopped .
31	1622	The spotting is very annoying though!
31	1623	I'm still spotting but I'm staying hopeful.
31	1624	Friday I woke up and went to work feeling brand new with light spotting.
31	1625	Then the spotting began.
31	1626	Anyways, I've had a little spotting, but it all happened exactly the way that my doctor said it would.
31	1627	The only real complaint I have about it is the nonstop bleeding and spotting.
31	1628	I get random (little to no) spotting and no prriods with this.
31	1629	There was the slight pain when it was placed and I honestly don't even remember spotting in the weeks afterwards, but that was 3 years ago.
31	1630	I was told it would take 6 months for it to "settle in" for the spotting to subside, which was true.
31	1631	And a lot of out the blew spotting and period .
31	1632	Had a few weeks of spotting but it's pretty much subsided.
31	1633	It's exhausting and lots of spotting.
31	1634	It was painful, I basically had a period for a month, and would have very regular spotting.
31	1635	More energy, higher sex drive, no more spotting.
31	1636	The worst part is the spotting.
31	1637	I have experienced longer spotting at the ends of my periods (usually a 4 day period, followed by a week or so of spotting).
31	1638	Unfortunately what followed was 7 months of continual bleeding with less than 15 non-bleeding or spotting days that entire time.
31	1639	I had no spotting the first week (except after initial insertion).
31	1640	After insertion there was slight bleeding throughout the day but nothing major, just spotting.
31	1641	You can still wear tampons for light spotting.
31	1642	I had the skyla inserted 02/03/2016  I have 2 kids I still felt some pain and some spotting it's pretty comfortable but keep in mind everybody's body is different just go based on your own experience
31	1643	Lol I didn't bleed during the process but around 8pm I started spotting and the pain is gone.
31	1644	The most annoying part after the first day was the spotting.
31	1645	I had a little brown spotting right when I left the dr office.
31	1646	I just had a child and they suggested this was the in between of the two main IUDs, between no hormone and high hormone No bleeding at first but then 6 months of spotting.
31	1647	My periods have gotten inconsistently messed up, from spotting to nasty thick stuff and for sometimes - for weeks at a time.
31	1648	Then I had one week of spotting, followed by one "spot free" week and back to a full blown 7 day period.
31	1649	Besides the daily spotting and spotting after sex skyla is ok.
31	1650	But I haven't gone a day without spotting and it's so annoying.
31	1651	I was worried that I would have weird spotting because that has been reported on it, but not me.
31	1652	I had light spotting after insertion for a day or so.
31	1653	Now there is little to no spotting and almost no pain.
31	1654	I spotted for about a month after, but the spotting stopped completely after my 2nd period with it.
31	1655	I'm still spotting but IM NOT PREGNANT, so I'm cool with it.
31	1656	So far I'm just annoyed with the bleeding and spotting it's so inconvenient.
31	1657	The only concern I have is with spotting.
31	1658	I've been spotting nonstop since insertion.
31	1659	Had only 4 clear days on 2nd week of November then back to spotting.
31	1660	Started spotting 3 days later for about a week and it has not gone away.
31	1661	I have not had any of the spotting, or anything of the sort.
31	1662	Hardly any spotting.
31	1663	And my period got lighter faster than it normally would, I'm "off" my period now but I still have some light spotting.
31	1664	had some spotting since the appointment, but that could also be the start of my period.
31	1665	Doc says I'm fine, and pills gave me similar weird spotting, so probably most other people do not experience this.
31	1666	But it's not a real period, just light spotting for about 2 to 4 days.
31	1667	I had started my period the day before and I was only spotting.
31	1668	But so far I've had nausea with this and alot of spotting :/ the spotting started abt 4 or 5 days after I got it out in and it has not stopped !!
31	1669	Well I went in for the follow up to check the placement of it and I asked my Dr when the spotting would most likely stop and she said a couple weeks on and off so I'm still waiting for it to stop this is the only thing I don't like abt it.
31	1670	OB says spotting will subside (it isn't that bad really just a speck on my panties, so I wear a liner.).
31	1671	My period has ended (I had it inserted midway my period), I just have some spotting but I was expecting way more than this.
31	1672	Then had some spotting for a month.
31	1673	The bleeding and spotting lasted for about 2 weeks then stopped.
31	1674	I have not had any periods just spotting here and there.
31	1675	I also still have spotting.
31	1676	I also had very little spotting which has since stopped.
31	1677	My Skyla was placed today with a little pain upon insertion with some spotting.
31	1678	I've been spotting ever since.
31	1679	Just lots of spotting.
31	1680	I got this done on the second day of my period, which turned into just light spotting for a day and then stopped all together.
31	1681	I have had spotting everyday, some light days and then experience some heavy days.
31	1682	I am still spotting as well.
31	1683	I had consistent spotting for 4 months.
31	1684	Long story short i have yet to have sex im actually sort of scared just cause idk how its going to feel but if all goes well and the spotting stops il definitely go back on here and leave a review for the most part come on girls skyla is way better then having children.
31	1685	My period lasted a little longer but has stopped with no spotting at all.
31	1686	I haven't had a period since, I have been spotting on and off though.
31	1687	After the first day I have had no other symptoms (spotting ,moodiness, etc ) and have to say I love my Skyla.
31	1688	So far lots of spotting.
31	1689	But now that I've had it for two months I have not had any spotting or any bleeding I am very happy so far .
31	1690	The pain continued for about a month, lots of spotting.
31	1691	I am completely fine today with minimal spotting and hope to continue like this.
31	1692	Cramps and spotting on and off thus far, but I love this IUD!
31	1693	I DID experience some in between spotting, but it wasn't anything major and happened maybe 3 times tops and the spotting lasting for 2-4 days.
31	1694	I was on the fourth day of my period when I got the insertion and I have light spotting today.
31	1695	A lot of spotting for the first two months, and cramping-wise I felt like I was on my period for two months.
31	1696	I've had light pink spotting and some pain here and there but it's suppose to be normal.
31	1697	I also had no spotting at all.
31	1698	It's not a full scale period but heavy spotting enough to fill a few panty liners a day or a thin pad.
31	1699	I had been thrilled at the concept of having no periods, until I started heavily spotting.
31	1700	Mild spotting since then, but no period.
31	1701	I did have some spotting but a panty liner was all I needed.
31	1702	I started off with some spotting here and there but it was so little that it didn't bother me.
31	1703	I had my period for a month, then didn't have anything but occasional spotting for a year.
31	1704	Maybe 3 days of spotting every three or four months.
31	1705	Today marks a week I've been spotting none stop which is annoying, but w/e that's a common side effect.
31	1706	My spotting is sporadic now instead of daily.
31	1707	During the first two months I had constant spotting and mood swings.
31	1708	I had spotting on and off for 2 months which is normal.
31	1709	I have no spotting between periods.
31	1710	I had spotting on and off for the next 3 months but no other side effects.
31	1711	Then about a week and half after the period I began spotting again for the next 2 weeks.
31	1712	The only real downside that I can tell is the 3 or so days of spotting after my period, but that has slowly been disappearing as well.
31	1713	I do have to wear panty liners more (especially during the first couple months you will spot a lot).
31	1714	Sex was fine except that I'd spot after depending how close to my period it was.
31	1715	I do randomly and I mean RANDOMLY spot, sometimes heavy sometimes light sometimes nothing at all, but prior to having the skyla inserted I did take 3 plan bs in the two months prior so that might also be to blame.
31	1716	Now I just spot brown discharge that has lightened up a lot
31	1717	I do spot on occasion nothing a thin panty liner can't take care of...but I did notice I was very emotional this week than usual...I'm not a crier but I found myself shedding tears 4/7 days this week and my sex drive is through the roof sometimes and sometimes it's very low (I've always had a low sex drive), plus I've been sleeping a lot this week.
31	1718	My period was longer (but lighter) for the first 6 months, but now I just spot for a couple of days every other month, which is fantastic.
31	1719	When it's period time I just spot.
31	1720	I did spot periodically after placement until my period started.
31	1721	I menstrated regularly for about 2 months then stopped pretty much altogether (I spot here and there).
31	1722	The first initial insertion hurts like hell and made me spot.
31	1723	Also at the 6 month mark my period changed again, now I spot and have an extremely light flow for over a week which is annoying.
31	1724	I kept going back to the doctor to make sure that the implant was in the right spot, thinking it wasn't because something felt really wrong.
31	1725	However, I did not spot at all afterward and I still haven't spotted.
31	1726	I spotted for about 2 months straight after I got it and still spot sometimes but my periods are short and few and far between.
31	1727	I would always spot two weeks before my period as well.
31	1728	It's gotten better since but I still spot a lot.
31	1729	I did spot for about 5 hours after I had it put in.
31	1730	My only issue is that I get regular blood spot outside of my cycle and that is not convenient as I basically lost half of my underwear collection, and not cool for my sex life.
31	1731	I immediately started to spot after.
31	1732	I started to spot later in the day but that's the worst side effect I'm experiencing.
31	1733	I do spot a little bit during days my periods are supposed to arrive (which, isnt that often.
31	1734	Bled a lot in the first 3 weeks, now I just occasionally spot throughout the month (I've had it in for 2 months now).
31	1735	In addition, I spotted and had a light period sometimes twice a month.
31	1736	I spotted every day for 8 months.
31	1737	Speaking of, I️ spotted for a no more than two weeks after insertion; my periods became significantly lighter during the first three months and by the fourth plateaued out but remained light the rest of the time.
31	1738	I spotted on and off for the first few months, which was annoying, but not a deal breaker.
31	1739	I spotted for a whole four weeks after the procedure.
31	1740	I spotted for a little over 3 months which wasn't fun since it was summer.
31	1741	I spotted on and off for 3 months but since then I have not gotten my period at all.
31	1742	I spotted for about a week after insertion and I have not had any bleeding since.
31	1743	I also lightly spotted for 3 months straight.
31	1744	I spotted for months and I don't know how I would have done it if I couldn't leave the menstrual cup in.
31	1745	I spotted on and off for about a month and was irregular for maybe 2-3 months but now my period is light, constantly on time and no side effects.
31	1746	I spotted on and off for about a month.
31	1747	I cramped and spotted after which is normal.
31	1748	I spotted for the first 4.5 weeks.
31	1749	Like I said it's only been 2 months and I noticed I have spotted a couple times.
31	1750	I spotted consistently during the first 2 months.
31	1751	I spotted a little at first, but now haven't had a period in about 5 months.
31	1752	I spotted pretty irregularly the first month, and when it came to the time my period was coming, I bled a full 8 days very heavily.
31	1753	I spotted for maybe a month to two months afterwards but have not had any  periods since.
31	1754	It was slightly painful and I spotted for an hour.
31	1755	I spotted a little bit the day of insertion and two weeks later began a period that lasted for about two weeks.
31	1756	I had a normal period and spotted for a week after.
31	1757	I spotted and cramped for 3 days then everything was normal UNTIL before my first skyla period on 10/02/16.
31	1758	I spotted a little bit right after it was inserted and that was it!
31	1759	At first it was unconftorable and I spotted for 3 months.
31	1760	However, I spotted for 2 full months, almost 3.
31	1761	I spotted for about 2 weeks after insertion.
31	1762	I spotted for about 6 weeks after it was inserted.
31	1763	Period was much lighter than normal but spotted for a whole month after.
31	1764	The first time I cramped spotted for weeks but it slowlly faded.
31	1765	I've spotted everyday, and there is an increase in vaginal mucus but that's common when your lining is thinning out.
31	1766	I spotted alot and my period eventually stop coming within 6 months.
31	1767	I spotted for a week or so and then nothing until 2 months in.
31	1768	I spotted for a few hours.
31	1769	I spotted for a few weeks, but now I don't even know it's there!
31	1770	However, I have not spotted one bit since!
31	1771	I was really worried after reading multiple reviews saying that women spotted for weeks right after they had it put in..I guess I'm not quite out of the woods yet but I'm feeling great!
31	1772	Have spotted every single day but one since I got it, tampons are now constantly part of my life.
31	1773	I was on the pill for a year, and spotted the whole time.
31	1774	I spotted for a few hours and it stopped.
31	1775	What I hated most about it was that I spotted for about 4-5 months and being someone that never spots, it got a little irritating..
31	1776	but i only spotted for a few days.
31	1777	The only thing bad about it is I spotted for about 2 cycles.
31	1778	I spotted for about 3 weeks and had one small period.
31	1779	I’ve been suffering from headaches daily, no energy, dizziness, and nausea.
31	1780	I also began to have horrible headaches!
31	1781	I was having constant headaches and high blood pressure the past 6 months.
31	1782	As soon as I stopped the pill and got Skyla my headaches are gone for the most part and my blood pressure is normal.
31	1783	The only negative effect I've been experiencing are headaches.
31	1784	Since the insertion I have experienced more headaches and sometimes feel light headed and dizzy.
31	1785	Now two months later,  I don't feel dizzy nor have headaches but I constantly feel pain on my ovaries.
31	1786	It is wonderful having birth control and not worrying about pills, periods, mood swings, or headaches.
31	1787	Had several migraines.
31	1788	Haven't had any migraines.
31	1789	I'm 32 with no children and started getting migraines with aura because of birth control pills.
31	1790	Sucks because I can't take the pill due to migraines with aura.
31	1791	So I'll be 28 in 2 months....I am getting Skyla tomorrow, but, I've had Mirena, after my 2 nd daughter I decided to get Mirena and it was the WORST thing in the WORLD....I was a major bitch I gained 20 lbs I was an emotional asshole and I bled NON stop...I can not be on birth control because I have a blood mutation so any pill makes me higher risk for blood clots...I just had my 3rd child almost 2 years ago and I had been getting SEVERE migraines and mood swings so I went to the doctor and asked her opinion, she said that Skyla is a lower dose and it may be better for me because she thinks the Mirena was too high of a hormone dose.
31	1792	After much research I decided on Skyla since it has the lowest dosage of hormones compared to Mirena and since I already suffer from migraines my doctor and I decided Skyla would be better.
31	1793	I probably have used every single form of birth control out there besides the injection and I would get intense migraines on every single one of them.
31	1794	I had to try a birth control without estrogen due to aura migraines that I was getting.
31	1795	I've had my Skyla for a week now, got it because I started experiencing migraines with aura.
31	1796	), no migraines.
31	1797	My migraines have increased but they had been over the last several years so I'm not sure it's connected.
31	1798	If you are sick of remembering to take a pill every day, have a long-term monogamous partner, and have nasty hormone side affects (I got migraines and crazy mood swings on the pill), Skyla is a great switch.
31	1799	I got an IUD because I have migraines and am unable to take estrogen.
31	1800	I was on the pill before and had to switch due to migraines caused by too much estrogen.
31	1801	I was getting really bad migraines especially at night.
31	1802	As a commuting student it was such a pain remembering to take my pill and the nuvaring gave me migraines.
31	1803	Because I suffer from chronic migraines and an aura, I could no longer be on the pill and so my doctor recommend Skyla.
31	1804	I have an aura with migraines so my doctor said it narrows my options for birth control as I'm at a higher risk on an estrogen pill.
31	1805	I got the Skyla IUD put in in the beginning of May 2014 due to my inability to take combined hormonal birth control of any sort due to major migraines and mood swings.
31	1806	Also my sex drive has went down a lot compared to where it was.
31	1807	It has decreased my sex drive made me hormonal mood swings depressed put a strain on my relationship with my husband because of that.
31	1808	It did increase my sex drive a lot though.
31	1809	Sex drive is outta this world (I wish it wasn't) absolutely no period!
31	1810	Another thing it def DID NOT decrease my sex drive at all!
31	1811	I'm hoping Skyla will help with my sex drive.
31	1812	So far I feel like my sex drive has increased which had always been a problem on other birth control.
31	1813	Sex has been very uncomfortable, and also decreased my sex drive.
31	1814	Sex drive through the roof.
31	1815	I have even lost the weight I put on from birth control pills, and my sex drive has increased.
31	1816	Fine since, more sex drive
31	1817	My sex drive is extremely high.
31	1818	My sexual partners can't feel a thing and weirdly enough.... My sex drive is OUT OF CONTROL!
31	1819	I feel like it has really increased my sex drive.
31	1820	Periods are lighter and sex drive is through the roof.
31	1821	Appetite is smaller, skin is clearer, zero mood swings, high sex drive, normal periods.
31	1822	I haven't noticed any weight gain and my sex drive is through the roof!
31	1823	No sex drive and I think I can feel where it is placed.
31	1824	Cons: weight gain, NO SEX DRIVE.
31	1825	My sex drive is completely gone.
31	1826	They ruined my sex drive (so has Skyla).
31	1827	I no longer have random pain that I used to get and the only negative that I have noticed is a lack of sex drive since getting it inserted, but I am going to the doctor soon to see if it is a side effect or if my hormones are off.
31	1828	At first sex drive was through the roof.
31	1829	No sex drive because of discharge side effects.
31	1830	The pros for me are an increased sex drive (OMG.
31	1831	My sex drive increased, and I have been having an abnormal amount of vaginal discharge.
31	1832	I also had a increase sex drive.
31	1833	How ever sex my sex drive decreased.
31	1834	Positive side effects: sex drive has increased where before (on the pill) it was practically nonexistent.
31	1835	No bleeding, but wow my sex drive is completely gone and I feel very anxious.
31	1836	I noticed during my second month that my sex drive was gone and my husband noticed as well.
31	1837	The pain is gone, but I have no sex drive and bleed for two weeks at a time.
31	1838	However, my sex drive is completely gone.
31	1839	I haven't gained weight, lost my sex drive or any other negative symptoms.
31	1840	I have noticed a decrease in my sex drive for about a two weeks after but not anything that I couldn't deal with.
31	1841	Didn't kill my sex drive or anything.
31	1842	Oh yeah, and I've noticed over the past 2 months that my sex drive has absolutely plummeted, and that I'm dry as a bone down there.
31	1843	I wanted to try an IUD, because I've had bad experiences with oral birth controls in the past--moodiness, anxiety, weight gain, decreased sex drive etc.
31	1844	Have my sex drive back.
31	1845	The Skyla IUD has made me develop ovarian cysts, which I never had on previous birth controls, and my sex drive has been almost non-existent.
31	1846	I haven't had any mood or sex drive changes and feel 100% better than I did on oral contraceptives.
31	1847	It messed with my sex drive for a while, but that seems to have evened out as well.
31	1848	I was on depo and nexplanon b4 an both had bad side effects, mainly painful intercourse and no libido is why I switched.
31	1849	Hormonally I feel better than ever, libido and mood is better than ever!
31	1850	Skyla has made my skin very oily, barely any libido, can't lose weight AT ALL, irritability, but hey I'm not pregnant.
31	1851	I've had it now for 6 days, my period ended quickly and it has increased my libido I feel empowered that I don't have to worry about another surprise pregnancy.
31	1852	All in all, this has been the BEST decision I've ever made in terms of birth control, prior to Skyla I took pills and they wreaked havoc on my body and libido, after almost three years I was fed up with the side effects so I opted to try something new.
31	1853	I've previously used pills & nuvaring, & didn't have bad side effects (except for no libido) but I wanted something long-term.
31	1854	One major change for me was a huge decrease in libido for the first 4 to 5 months.
31	1855	I got the Skyla IUD a year ago trying to resolve my libido issues that was stemming from my oral birth control pills that I had been taking for the past 4 years.
31	1856	Never had any problems with libido before this.
31	1857	I have bad mood swings, I get depressed all the time, and my libido is definitely decreased.
31	1858	I've tried a ton and had issues with all of them regarding decreased libido, breakthrough bleeding, and moodiness.
31	1859	No weight gain or bloating (in fact I’ve lost some weight) and it’s so nice not worrying.
31	1860	After a year and a half, I reflected and noted severe bloating and weight gain that I had never experienced previously.
31	1861	I was on the pill for 10yrs & wasn't happy with weight gain & PMS symptoms, also tired of taking a pill everyday.
31	1862	I am freaking out for weight gain, it has been convenient, no maintenance, and I’m not pregnant.
31	1863	I have been on the depo shot for 2 years and decided to go off of it due to weight gain.
31	1864	No weight gain, skin didn't change.
31	1865	My periods were lighter, no weight gain, minor PMS.
31	1866	I also did not experience any weight gain.
31	1867	They say weight gain isn't a side effect but I honestly feel like I've gained weight or I'm bloated
31	1868	My periods are very rare, maybe 3 or 4 a year, no severe weight gain or skin problems.
31	1869	I recently went to my family doctor and expressed that I wasn't happy with the weight gain, my mood swings (random crying, anger fits) and I said I wanted to take it out.
31	1870	So far, so good but time will tell as far as mood swings, weight gain etc.
31	1871	I spoke to my doctor about getting an IUD because I battled with the pill for too long, between weight gain and an emotional roller coaster I was just fed up so we went with the Skyla.
31	1872	I also experienced weight gain.
31	1873	I had requested to my doctor to give me a birth control with low chances of weight gain because I recently lost 20 pounds and now I'm behind 3 months of workouts due to this weight gain.
31	1874	I wanted to get off the pill as it caused me weight gain and water retention and the amount of hormones makes it hard for women to build muscle,& as someone who works out a decent amount, I wasn't seeing much progress.
31	1875	Haven't gotten pregnant and my face had really cleared up, no weight gain so far!
31	1876	My period was a little lighter and I have not had any weight gain as of yet.
31	1877	I'm not good with birth control pills so I guess I'm stuck with the weight gain.
31	1878	I haven't had any breakouts or weight gain and I would recommend this to anyone :-)
31	1879	The only thing now is that I'm experiencing the weight gain.
31	1880	Will be getting this removed very  soon not liking my weight gain.
31	1881	CONS .... Lost of sexual appetite , increase in discharge ,weight gain .
31	1882	No weight gain(as of yet!
31	1883	Since getting it I have gained 13 lbs even though I have started exercising more regularly to combat the weight gain.
31	1884	I have been reading some other forums and a lot of other women were experiencing the same problem but all of their doctors kept saying weight gain isn't from it.
31	1885	I have also had a significant weight gain 15 lbs since I got it.
31	1886	I also started feeling depressed during the fourth month and noticed mood swings and weight gain.
31	1887	I've read a lot of reviews saying girls reacted badly with daily bleeding, major PMS, and weight gain but I never had any of that.
31	1888	I'd had bouts with weight gain (20 lbs!)
31	1889	Really hoping to not regret this decision, I don't want to go back to my depo injections and their weight gain.
31	1890	No weight gain.
31	1891	No weight gain, not having to worry about taking a pill every day.
31	1892	So far with skyla my hair is falling out,mood swings, weight gain.
31	1893	I also do not have any mood swings, depression, and weight gain, which were side effects for me with oral birth control pills and the nuvaring.
31	1894	+ I gained 17 pounds.
31	1895	I also gained 15lbs in the first 3 months.
31	1896	I️ gained about 25 pounds within the ten months and I️ noticed I was tired, irritable and hormonal all the time- not just when I️ had my period.
31	1897	I haven't gained any weight with Skyla either.
31	1898	I gained weight with this and also got diagnosed with anxiety and depression.
31	1899	I’ve tried birth control pills twice before, and each time I gained approx.
31	1900	I've been on the pill twice and gained significant weight both times.
31	1901	I didn't think such a low hormone dose could affect me as much as it has, but I've already gained 20 lbs and ready to get my life back.
31	1902	I was always hungry, I gained 15lbs when I went on the pill.
31	1903	I've gained 30 pounds out of the blue.
31	1904	I used to be on the pill and shot for a while but both of those made me really depressed and I gained a ton of weight.
31	1905	Strange thing is I've gained 4 lbs since I got it even though I've been exercising a lot more since.
31	1906	Furthermore, I gained about 7 pounds.
31	1907	I gained 36 lbs when pregnant, had lost 30 in the 3 months after birth.
31	1908	But now with Skyla I've gained back 18 lbs.
31	1909	I also gained weight.
31	1910	I've gained a few lbs but diet & lifestyle also come into play there.
31	1911	also was afraid to gain weight I have not gained any weight at all it worked
31	1912	I have not gained any weight, I have lost some (though not on purpose).
31	1913	I have not gained any weight, however, I have had a hard time losing the weight that I wanted to (only about 10lbs).
31	1914	I have gained about 20lbs since then, which sucks.
31	1915	Also gained 8 lbs in <3 wks.
31	1916	I've gained so much weight and just can't seem to get rid of it.
31	1917	In the first month I gained 15 pounds (after remaining the same weight for over ten years now) which I have since lost.
31	1918	The only negative thing I have to say is that I have gained weight since the insertion.
31	1919	I've gained about 15 pounds but, it's not something I'm worried about.
31	1920	Spotting only lasted for 6 weeks but within the last 4 months I have gained 15 pounds which is very bad.
31	1921	I've gained about 10 pounds.
31	1922	Since I got it almost 3 months ago I have gained 15 pounds while still using my same workout & eating plan.
31	1923	Now I never know when theyre coming, I gained a considerable amount of weight, which Ive gotten under control with diet, as my periods are almost always close to two weeks long.
31	1924	My diet hasn't changed, but I've gained so much weight on it.
31	1925	Since being on the pill, I had gained about 20.
31	1926	I've gained about 20-30 lb and I have noticed that my hair seems to be thinning.
31	1927	I've gained 10 pounds with no change to my lifestyle.
31	1928	The pill was probably the worst experience for me, I gained about 15lbs, bleed for 6 months straight I was on it and it made crazy mentally.
31	1929	I gained about 30 lbs in the 3 yrs of it!
31	1930	Not to mention the weight I have gained on it.
31	1931	I have gained about 20lbs since then.
31	1932	The second year I gained so much weight and can not get it off not even one pound LITERALLY.
31	1933	I have gained about 8 lbs.
31	1934	I've gained about 8lbs since I had Skyla put in, but also have a job change where I went from walking all day to a desk job so I don't know if there is a direct correlation, just thought I'd mention.
31	1935	However, I've gained 15 lbs!!!!!!
31	1936	I literally gained them within a month.
31	1937	Since then I've had horrible mood swings and a weird period that has pretty much lasted for three months and have gained about 15 pounds.
31	1938	I was on the depo for 2 years and gained a lot of weight.
31	1939	Especially since on the depo shots I gained weight.
31	1940	I gained around 6 pounds which sucked but I'll take it over baby weight.
31	1941	I haven't gained weight, don't feel out of emotional control and haven't had a period since!
31	1942	Also I gained about 10 lbs.
31	1943	I gained 10 pounds in one month.
31	1944	It has been a month and I was in the hospital last night with extreme pain in my abdomen and pelvic region, nausea, and dizziness.
31	1945	I could hardly sit up in the bathroom because I was so lightheaded and nausea caused me to vomit.
31	1946	I had cold sweats, nausea, and was worried I'd faint.
31	1947	And I can't forget to mention the nausea bad temper mood swings and tears.
31	1948	I could feel how tense my body got and felt as if I was going to pass out also had nausea for the most part of the after the iud.
31	1949	But once Skyla was in there... no pain, light headed mess, nausea, or even bleeding.
31	1950	I was not nauseated or lightheaded afterwards.
31	1951	For about an hour after I was super nauseated and faint.
31	1952	I had to come off the pill because I was constantly emotional, tired & nauseous.
31	1953	I felt nauseous and faint afterwards, but not too bad.
31	1954	It does however sometimes make me nauseous and have bad acid reflux but other than that I've enjoyed my experience with it.
31	1955	After I sat up and was sweating and so nauseous ( stupid me didn't eat beforehand) and literally almost passed out.
31	1956	I became very nauseous and had to wait at the doctors office before returning home.
31	1957	I didn't feel nauseous or light headed.
31	1958	At insertion my pain level went to about a 9 I got super hot and nauseous but it went away in less than a minute.
31	1959	After insertion I was very dizzy and super nauseous.
31	1960	After my OBGYN inserted the IUD, I felt nauseous then fainted.
31	1961	Immediately I felt nauseous, dizzy, and had to have the nurses walk me to the bathroom where I got diarrhea.
31	1962	Insertion was pretty rough, there was pretty bad pain for maybe 20 seconds and afterward I felt nauseous and lightheaded for about an hour.
31	1963	It was making me nauseous, depressed, and anxious.
31	1964	The initial insertion was pretty painful but only lasted about a minute, got extremely light headed and nauseous after insertion but went away within 20 minutes, I got mine done at planned parenthood which I'd suggest and was even able to get it for free through a program they have and only paid for implantation.
31	1965	I'm nauseous a lot too.
31	1966	my cervix and it hurt so bad upon insertion that I got immediately nauseous and almost fainted.
31	1967	During and after placement that day, I had a lot of pain and dizziness and was pretty nauseous.
31	1968	The insertion of it was so painful I was shaking, sweating, and nauseous.
31	1969	I was nauseous and had diarhea for about and hour and a half after it was inserted.
31	1970	I spend hours without eating and I don't get nauseous or dizzy which is very not like me.
31	1971	Yes I got dizzy which is common but they gave me juice and had me wait about 5 minutes and I was able to drive myself home just fine.
31	1972	After it was inserted, I felt normal and was not dizzy or lightheaded.
31	1973	I got very dizzy and hot and bled a lot after.
31	1974	I felt fine when I left but walking to my car I became week and dizzy and ended up throwing up in the parking lot.
31	1975	I don't know if because of the hormones and stuff in it but I got it inserted a week ago and ever since then I've been dizzy and no appetite.
31	1976	I felt a little dizzy after the insertion and felt better.
31	1977	I got shakey, hot, dizzy and felt like throwing up.
31	1978	I got a little dizzy afterwards, but drank my lemonade and laid down for a bit.
31	1979	I thought I was okay, but then I got dizzy and my blood pressure dropped really low; I had to stay at the office for a bit.
31	1980	The procedure was short but the pain from it was the worst thing I have ever gone through not to mention I was dizzy for the rest of the day after.
31	1981	It was extremely painful (although the worst of the pain only lasted about 2 mins) but I ended up having to stay at my doctor's office for about 30 minutes because I was extremely dizzy right after, although my doctor told me that it was normal for a lot of women, and since I drove myself I wanted to be safe.
31	1982	I was pale sweating and dizzy after insertion.
31	1983	I felt only slightly dizzy but was actually quiet surprised that I felt relatively ok.
31	1984	For the first month or so,  I felt so dizzy like I had vertigo.
31	1985	When I did I was dizzy and went to the bathroom and threw up.
31	1986	Hours after I had been home I went to go outside and suddenly felt nauseas, got extremely dizzy with blurred vision I thought I was about to pass out!
31	1987	After he was done the whole meltdown came down I stood up I felt dizzy lightheaded and weak and I saw black spots n boom I was passing out.
31	1988	I was dizzy and felt sick for a few minutes.
31	1989	I was able to drive and walk right afterwards, no pain, dizziness, or any of that!
31	1990	Getting the IUD inserted was not fun, but I have noticed a big change in my moods (less mood swings) and my period is extremely light/short at this point.
31	1991	10 lbs and had mood swings, SO I decided to try an IUD.
31	1992	I also have noticed mood swings more.
31	1993	I have noticed some slight mood swings but nothing too extreme.
31	1994	I was on the pill prior to my new IUD and I had the worst PMS and mood swings imaginable.
31	1995	I will say that my mood swings seem WAY better.
31	1996	I only had it one month because of the extremely bad mood swings and irritability.
31	1997	I don't get mood swings, haven't had abnormal hair loss or anything.
31	1998	The shot and the pill both gave me really out of control mood swings, so I thought this would be better.
31	1999	The major drawback for me is the mood swings and depression.
31	2000	I can't birthcontrol pills they give me crazy mood swings so I got the iud on 10-13-16.
31	2001	Had some pretty ridiculous mood swings for the first week or two while adjusting to the hormones but it seems to have leveled out now.
31	2002	I tried pill after pill for 6 years, hated them all, whether it was bad skin or mood swings.
31	2003	My mood swings are ridiculous and I've cried almost every night for the past 2 weeks, and I hardly ever cry.
31	2004	It felt like I was on a constant period with all these mood swings.
31	2005	I was hesitant since it did wonders for my skin, but so not worth the mood swings.
31	2006	I would recommend this birth control to anyone that doesnt want to take the pill everyday, has bad periods, mood swings, bad ache, and doesnt want to have childern.
31	2007	PMS seems bad though (mood swings, irritability, appetite increase).
31	2008	No breakouts and no mood swings (yet).
31	2009	The mood swings suck.
31	2010	My mood swings are crazy especially when I'm pmsing.
31	2011	I'm a person who has always had strong reactions to hormonal bc and I am starting to notice mood swings and an overall more sad mood than normal.
31	2012	The mood swings are awful - considering early removal.
31	2013	In the first two weeks I also had some minor mood swings but nothing compared to how I felt on the pill.
31	2014	I'm 21, no kids, got Skyla about a month ago after dealing with crazy mood swings with a different bc  I was taking.
31	2015	My appetite basically disappeared, I've had weird mood swings and I've been feeling down.
31	2016	He's willing to try again once I get it taken out, but he can't handle the deep depression and mood swings.
31	2017	No crazy mood swings.
31	2018	I got this IUD a week ago, after much research, and after several years of trying to be on birth control but hating the mood swings and forgetting to take it all the time.
31	2019	The first month or two I had variable mood swings around the time of my period but I stuck it out and my hormones have since stabilized.
31	2020	Tried out the ring which was a horrible two months of mood swings and discomfort.
31	2021	I am a 33 year old woman, no children, and hormonal birth control was no longer agreeing with my body (mood swings, heavy bleeding, large clots, periods lasting 2 weeks, etc.)
31	2022	Now I have insane mood swings, gas, minor cramps..period symptoms.
31	2023	I notice a slight mood change once a month-ish and it used to be really bad for me.
31	2024	I had nexplanon for a year and a half after my first daughter was born but changed to skyla because of irregular cycles and mood changes.
31	2025	Also other IUD's last for 5 years and slightly bigger, that made me nervous.
31	2026	So I was extremely nervous to get an IUD because I heard it was horrible pain to get inserted.... then at my appointment they said I was too small for Mirena and offered to do skyla which I hadn't had a chance to Google or anything so I was a little skeptical.
31	2027	I was so nervous to get the Skyla because I was afraid of a painful procedure but it was not painfully unbearable like I expected,  just a little uncomfortable for literally 10 seconds, Then I was done!
31	2028	I was SO nervous to get the Skyla in.
31	2029	I was so nervous for it that I was shaking and fanning myself before the doctor even walked in to the room.
31	2030	I wanted to write this review for anyone who is nervous about the procedure or feels discouraged from all the negative reviews out there about IUDs.
31	2031	I know before I went in I was very nervous about how painful insertion would be after reading reviews.
31	2032	I read so many horror stories online about the IUD insertion and I was extremely nervous for the insertion process.
31	2033	After reading all the reviews before hand I was really nervous but I did what my doctor instructed which was to take 800 mg of ibuprofen and eat an hour before my appointment and I was fine!
31	2034	I told my doctor I was nervous of how awful it was going to feel and he assured me that it was all in my head.
31	2035	I got my Skyla inserted 4 days ago, I was so nervous to go through with it after spending countless hours reading other people experiences.
31	2036	Ladies, like many of you, I was nervous.
31	2037	DON'T READ HORROR STORIES before going in, it made me 100 times more nervous than I needed to be.
31	2038	Honestly I was SO nervous to get the skyla but I'm so glad I did.
31	2039	I was so nervous after reading reviews, but I followed through with my appointment.
31	2040	When reading reviews on the skyla I got very nervous and doubted if I wanted to get it.
31	2041	By the way I too was nervous but it wasn't too terrible.
31	2042	I was so nervous to get this IUD when I read the reviews!
31	2043	I was shaking the entire time because I was so nervous and it was just a lot of pressure that was over really quicklg.
31	2044	I got Skyla 2 days ago and was really nervous before my appointment because I read all of the reviews that same morning.
31	2045	I have a low pain tolerance so I was nervous but if you are nervous too ask to be prescribed an anti anxiety drug before and then throw out whatever you don't use.
31	2046	I was extremely nervous.
31	2047	When I first got it put in I was a little nervous.
31	2048	I was very nervous about getting my Skyla inserted after reading negative blog posts all over the Internet.
31	2049	So I felt compelled to share my experience on here because I too read these prior to my appointment yesterday and was a nervous wreck!
31	2050	Hey ladies, Many of the reviews are terrifying and because of that I went into my appointment very nervous.
31	2051	I wasn't near as nervous as I shouldve been before the insertion of Skyla.
31	2052	I made the mistake of reading these and I was so nervous for my appointment.
31	2053	I read so many reviews about how painful insertion would be, and I got myself really worked up and was very nervous when I went to see my doctor.
31	2054	Before my procedure I did all my research and was very nervous when I read others people's experience.
31	2055	I was really nervous, however it was not that bad.
31	2056	I'm 18 5'2 and 125 lbs, I've been on pills for 2 years prior to getting Skyla, I went to my gyno originally to get Nexaplanon in my arm and it turns out they didn't have it due to insurance not covering it, so they recommended Skyla, I was so nervous and I think that worked my nerves up real good and stressed me out so bad that the insertion was BRUTAL!!!
31	2057	I was SO nervous about it after reading about it online, especially because I was not on my period during it.
31	2058	I was extremely nervous going into this, so nervous my doctor prescribed me medication to calm down.
31	2059	I was nervous.
31	2060	I wanted to come on here to share my experience because I too read many of these reviews that made me very nervous about the process.
31	2061	The reviews I had seen made me very anxious and nervous, but the whole process took maybe 8-10 minutes.
31	2062	I went in very nervous.
31	2063	I have never had an IUD before , I was quite nervous leading up to the appointment .
31	2064	I'm 18 I've never been pregnant or anything of that sort but going in to the input of the skyla I was nervous because I read the reviews on this website and it made me really scared as , I just got the skyla in me about an hour ago  I'm a heavy bleeder.
31	2065	When we finally began the procedure, I was so nervous.
31	2066	I was extremely nervous about the insertion, so my NP prescribed me some Ativan to take prior to the procedure which helped a lot.
31	2067	The insertion was uncomfortable but honestly not that bad with all the drugs in my system (lol) so if you're nervous, I recommend just telling your doctor so!
31	2068	I read all these horror stories online and made myself extremely nervous!
31	2069	I couldn't help but laugh at myself for being so nervous.
31	2070	I can't lie I'm nervous for sex.
31	2071	I had skyla inserted this morning I was very nervous because all I kept reading was how painful it was.
31	2072	I spent a ton of time researching Skyla and IUDs in general before getting mine put in and I've always been nervous about the whole procedure.
31	2073	I was super nervous about getting considering I'm very self conscious but it wasn't as embarrassing as I had thought it would be.
31	2074	(Kinda makes me nervous when it happens so I take a preg.
31	2075	Honestly I think the worst part of the day was how nervous I was and I was reading everything about how much it hurt and I was working myself up but everyone is different if you go in with an open mind and your comfortable with your doctor I'm sure you will be fine
31	2076	I was nervous going in a little bit but was optimistic.
31	2077	Before the procedure, I started doing heavy breathing, similar to pregnancy breaths, bc I was so nervous and I can tell you I felt NOTHING.
31	2078	I was really nervous about getting skyla but it has been the best birth control experience I have ever had!
31	2079	To everyone thinking about skyla, don't be nervous.
31	2080	I was very nervous after reading how painful it was for some women.
31	2081	I was nervous for the insertion but it wasn't bad.
31	2082	I've been a nervous wreck to the point that it's driving me insane.
31	2083	I am writing on here because I thought many reviews I read were very misleading, and I was very nervous beforehand, which I realize was not necessary.
31	2084	I went in that day around 4 pm and sat on the table nervous as hell.
31	2085	She gave me Cytotec to take the night before the procedure to loosen my cervix but I was still very nervous when I went to the office .
31	2086	I have experienced a lot worst pain in my life I was nervous for nothing .
31	2087	Beforehand, I read a lot of these comments which really made me nervous about going through with it.
31	2088	I told my doctor I read all the horror stories and I was so nervous, she told me to NEVER do that.
31	2089	I went in extremely nervous and really wanting to run out of there and never come back but once it was time she walked me through every little thing she did.
31	2090	I am a weenie for pain and I read some of the horror stories so I was nervous but had reassurance from my best friend who already had skyla.
31	2091	So I was very nervous.
31	2092	I was so nervous when I went in because reviews said it would be the worst pain I would ever experience.
31	2093	I cried a ton because I was so nervous.
31	2094	I went in today to have Skyla inserted at a local planned parenthood and I could not have been more nervous due to the terrible insertion stories that I had read online.
31	2095	The second month I missed my period all together which made me nervous but my doctor said it was normal and I had my period the following month.
31	2096	After being on two different pill birth controls, I was tired of not feeling like myself- unhappy, negative, anxious, crying.
31	2097	I was so anxious I almost cancelled as I'm not good with pain.
31	2098	( never had kids) I'm a very anxious person and was SO nervous/anxious for insertion.
31	2099	I was super anxious about the pain because of how badly my experience was with the Copper IUD.
31	2100	I was SO anxious about having it inserted but it truly was a breeze (I also had taken .5 mg Xanax, which I highly recommend prior to IUD insertion, it helps a lot).
31	2101	I was SO anxious to get Skyla.
31	2102	More importantly, I had noticed changes in my mood (more anxious and overall down).
31	2103	Other things I've noticed that there are days were I feel more anxious than the situation calls for and indigestion problems like heartburn or diarrhea.
31	2104	Everyone is different I wish someone would have told me to take some anxiety medication and pain relievers.
31	2105	I suffer from severe anxiety.
31	2106	I've also felt a sense of anxiety I didn't have prior to Skyla.
31	2107	My ears went numb and I couldn't see, this was prob from all the anxiety I worked up.
31	2108	Day of insertion I was having major anxiety, so I took have of a Xanax bar (1mg).
31	2109	I would highly recommend asking your doctor for a prescription for anti anxiety medication, even if it's just one pill for the procedure.
31	2110	However, it has upped my anxiety, given me depression, and I suspect that it has something to do with some other medical issues I have been suffering with.
31	2111	The doctor did not give me anything for anxiety or the pain.
31	2112	It gave me so much unnecessary anxiety.
31	2113	I have major anxiety and was so scared to get it after reading mixed stories on how it feels and how some people get lidocane for numbing down there because it can be painful.
31	2114	They reccomend 800 mg ibprofen before i took 1 vicodin because my anxiety is so bad I felt i needed something stronger and I happen to have some in my medicine cabinet... and literally felt nothing but a little pressure.
31	2115	I would say that the insertion wasn't so much painful as it was uncomfortable and anxiety inducing.
31	2116	I have a low pain tolerance, and the worst imaginable anxiety.
31	2117	So many of these reviews scared me immensely and caused a lot of anxiety leading up to my Skyla appointment.
31	2118	I almost bailed on the whole thing due to my anxiety!
31	2119	Have some occasional mood issues like anxiety but that could easily be chalked up to life stuff.
31	2120	I struggle with depression and anxiety and I was afraid that hormonal birth control would only make matters worse.
31	2121	I've been having a lot of anxiety, panic attacks and would get depressed but never thought it was fron this birth control till I saw the other comments.I would not recommend it for anyone
31	2122	It's now over a year later and on September 15th of this year I ended up in the ER for having a anxiety panic attack in my truck while driving down the freeway at 90 miles per hour.
31	2123	I've always had little bouts of depression and anxiety but in the past two months it has been unbearable.
31	2124	I decided I wanted to get off birth control pills because I suspected they were causing depression and anxiety (they were!).
31	2125	Its normal for me I panic n anxiety hits after not before.
31	2126	I screamed during insertion and had to stay in the office 30 minutes afterward for my anxiety levels to calm down.
31	2127	The reason I initially got Skyla was because the mini-pills I was on previously were making me absolutely crazy, with severe anxiety and basically depression every single day.
31	2128	I don't remember reading that.. Oh, apparently "vulvavaginitis" aka any sort of angry vaginal infection includes yeast infections, and occurs in like 20% of users, way more with Skyla than Mirena.
31	2129	I'm getting vaginal infections all the time from literally anything; my period, sex, and even clothing is throwing off my PH.
31	2130	The only thing I would worry about is the fact that you may sometimes get vaginal infections.
31	2131	I advise you to take off from work the day of insertion, and grab some yogurt to prevent a yeast infection.
31	2132	After about an hour the side effects subsided but sex was uncomfortable, I could feel it, and I got a yeast infection.
31	2133	Went for my follow up and I did have a yeast infection, Dr said that can happen because when they prep you during placement it can kill the good bacteria as well as the bad.
31	2134	Day six-a yeast infection?!
31	2135	Now I have a severe yeast infection causing blisters on my vulva, and am extremely tired and sensitive.
31	2136	I was prescribed a vaginal cream which was similar=for yeast infection, it went away in 1 week
31	2137	After a couple of months, I started to get yeast infections twice a month and sex became painful.
31	2138	Also I get more UTI and yeast infections since insertion (not sure if they're related)..
32	1	It cleared my acne, no mood swings, no pain during my SHORT periods (I used to have 7 day periods), no nausea, or anything.
32	2	I have not seen a big difference in my acne clearing up, and I've been on it for a few months now.
32	3	My stress levels got worse, I could feel my hormones have been completely out of balance, I am more irritable than ever, no sex drive (which has never happened to me before), a burst of cystic acne (again, first time in my life).
32	4	I have no problem with acne or stomach issues.
32	5	I used to have extremely bad acne as well and Sprintec helped me with it.
32	6	I started breaking out with cystic acne around my jaw and mouth as well as worsening depression and anxiety.
32	7	I never had acne, now I have it all over my face.
32	8	My acne isn’t too much better but I’ll give it more time, got my period so it’s doing it’s job.
32	9	My acne has cleared since starting the birth control.
32	10	The pill worked great for birth control and acne was better than ever.
32	11	I have a lot less mood swings (they're still there, but not nearly as many), less acne, and my boobs have gone up almost another cup.
32	12	It didn't really alleviate menstrual cramps either, but did help me with treating acne.
32	13	Spintec isn't making me have  mood swings or depressed but I've only been on it for three weeks and I've already gained 15 pounds and had really bad acne and dry skin which I never had before !
32	14	When I first started taking it, I kind of lost my appetite, and my acne disappeared.
32	15	I primarily take it to manage my acne since I  get terrible cysts on my jaw and cheek all the time.
32	16	My face is clear ( no acne) , my periods are very short and light ( was 5 days and heavy before), I have no cramps or breast soreness during or before periods.
32	17	They either made me depressed, induced anxiety, headaches, acne, etc.
32	18	On the good side my acne cleared up and my period was light and only lasted 4-5 days.
32	19	My periods are regular now and even cleared up some acne.
32	20	Coming from 1 yr with a mirena IUD and the side effect of intense acne, my experience 2 months in is phenomenal!
32	21	I started taking this to prevent pregnancy, since I have light, painless periods and no acne.
32	22	Even after a year, I had acne breakouts every month, significant cramping on my periods, loss of appetite, nausea, and mood swings/suicidal thoughts during my PMS week.
32	23	I had my face under control but I would always get back acne, and I don't break out on my back anymore.
32	24	My acne has also greatly improved.
32	25	I went on this birth control to clear up my moderate acne.
32	26	I continued to take it and it did clear up my acne.
32	27	I had acne really bad before I started the pill and the worst cramps of life.
32	28	Weight gain, acne, mood swings, no sex drive.... and for the first 2 months of Sprintec, I can say all of that was true.
32	29	My mild acne subsided significantly and still to this day seems non-existent.
32	30	Side effects I've been experiencing: fatigue, nausea(non-stop), slight cramping, acne breakouts(which I've never had an issue with before), fuller breasts, very sore/tender breasts, and my period has yet to start.
32	31	The two positives are my skin stays clear, although my skin has never been prone to acne, and I've never gotten pregnant.
32	32	Looking for a dependable alternative that works and won't cause weight gain or acne so I can stop taking this
32	33	I was so afraid to go on birth control, because I always heard about weight gain and acne.
32	34	I get the same symptoms before my period, sore breasts, acne and occasional cravings.
32	35	No problem with acne at all, just body hair growth.
32	36	When I skipped the placebos and began my 2nd pack, and my forehead exploded in acne within the first 3 days, and several painful cysts formed.
32	37	It eventually developed to the point where I got hormonal acne on my forehead and chin, places I had NEVER gotten acne.
32	38	I stayed on the pill for 3 months and couldn't take the acne any more, and the worst part is that the acne WORSENED after I got off.
32	39	It has been four months and my face is filled with acne scars and new blemishes.
32	40	Especially if you have sensitive skin or acne free skin to begin with!
32	41	I have terrible constipation and got terrible acne all over my body out of nowhere !!!
32	42	I never had body acne until I started taking this pill again.
32	43	But, my acne is absolutely awful...in turn I feel awful.
32	44	Honestly the worst acne I have ever seen.
32	45	The first couple of months were a bit odd: I experienced an increase of appetite, a short-lived acne attack, then sore breasts 1 - 2 weeks before the withdrawal period.
32	46	I had low sex drive, super irregular periods, and some acne before I started Sprintec about two months ago.
32	47	My sex drive has certainly improved but now I am bloated so often and my acne is INSANE!
32	48	My overall acne has improved, I do breakout around my period but I think that is normal.
32	49	No increase or decrease of acne.
32	50	While my chest did grow and I didn't have mood swings or weight gain, I experienced some of the most painful and humiliating acne of my life while taking it.
32	51	I have had NO acne, NO weight gain, NO suicidal thoughts.
32	52	The negatives- mood swings, leg cramps, occasional cystic acne (a week before and during placebo week), remembering to take it everyday, and breast tenderness.
32	53	I don't really have acne, I haven't gained weight, my boobs look fuller, and I haven't gotten pregnant yet.
32	54	Gained eight and acne problems became more severe.
32	55	I had a little bit of acne at first but nothing terrible, I just rarely get breakouts.
32	56	Within a week of taking Sprintec I noticed a lot more acne on my face than I did before taking it.
32	57	I do still get a bit nauseous at the beginning of the pack, but it may be because I take my pill early in the morning (have a good meal before you take it) it has also helped calm down my cystic acne.
32	58	(I'm 25 and I've never had acne before until a couple of months ago due to stress at work) Most importantly, this does work for prevention of pregnancy!
32	59	In the first month of taking Sprintec, I had a breakouts of acne, more than I usually had.
32	60	I'm from Latin America and I used to take DIANE-35, that has very low hormone component, controls acne, reduce PMS symptoms and causes shorter periods, but is not available in the US.
32	61	I have developed bad acne, have horrible headaches everyday and my periods have gotten so bad I'm pretty much on bed rest the whole time.
32	62	I immediately got cystic  back acne (like really bad) a month after taking it.
32	63	I didn't think anything of it, so I just continued to take it and I thought that the  back acne was a new thing for me.
32	64	Four years later, my cystic acne is still horrible, I have scars like crazy on my back.
32	65	Ok fine maybe because it's new but I'm also nauseous EVERYDAY right after I eat or drink ANYTHING (it's helping me loose weight because I can't keep much down) also now I have acne like I've never had acne.
32	66	Other than that, my periods have been on the heavier side, but no mood swings or acne flare ups.
32	67	Around April/ May of last year, I went to get my refill and noticed that the packaging changed and I started getting cystic acne around my chin.
32	68	My acne flares got less frequent and MUCH smaller so that worked well after about 2 months on it.
32	69	However, I've developed negative side effects including: painful cramping for weeks at a time, bleeding between periods, stomach bloating, acne and breast pain.
32	70	It's clearing up my acne and sex drive is better by a smidge, but my period is a lot longer and heavier, rather than shorter and lighter like it was on Loryna.
32	71	I didn't have a problem with acne before occasionally it will flare up when my period was about to come or stress, but I noticed that it has cleared up my face and my back significantly.
32	72	My acne has been getting better though which is a plus for me since I have PCOS and get cystic acne often.
32	73	Since I have started on this, I am spotting constantly and my acne has flared up.
32	74	My acne wasn't bad to begin with but now its starting to act up, I still get moody.. And sometimes my periods come three days late (its exactly 3 days every time) but it ends up coming which worried me before.
32	75	It's cleaning my acne wich is awesome!
32	76	Its been four months and I started back up again but this time I just have acne flare up and have to eat every few hours.
32	77	I have also gained weight on this pill (I am ALWAYS hungry), have constant cramps and back pain, and I started getting huge pimples (have never had acne before starting the pill).
32	78	I was on Levora for 10 years and still suffered from mild/severe acne.
32	79	If you continue daily face care, including washing your face daily with mild cleansers and moisturizers, acne will subside.
32	80	I haven't expirenced anything unusual...I initially started taking it for irregular periods (I'd only get 11 days between each, which sucked) and to maybe clear up my acne.
32	81	It definitely got me regular, although didn't help much with acne, it didn't make it worse or change the current condition.
32	82	Been on it for 8 months controlled acne ( on my back) periods are normal.
32	83	It works like it should, & has cleared my acne up incredibly.
32	84	I'm twenty-five-years old and still suffer from mild, cystic acne.
32	85	I did my research as far as using a contraceptive to combat acne goes and found that using a monophasic pill (which keeps your hormone levels at an even keel throughout the month), such as Sprintec, can sometimes be the best choice for young women.
32	86	I started using Sprintec after requesting a pill that helped reduce acne.
32	87	But, my acne have been clearing up, decrease of appetite, and a little moody for the first four hours after I taken the pill.
32	88	So far, no side effects, no weight gain, no headaches or nausea, and I actually think it is helping clear what little acne I had.
32	89	Also no weight gain or nausea and acne has finally stopped after years of struggle.
32	90	Doctor told me to try this because I suffered with terrible acne.
32	91	Pores are smaller, acne scars are fading and everything.
32	92	Normally right before my period I would break out just a little and but this pill has eliminated almost all of my acne except for maybe one minor blemish here or there.
32	93	No pregnancies, keeps acne at bay, periods only last ~4 days when it used to be heavy flow for 7  days without birth control (plus, can predict what time it will come; mine starts between 3-7 pm every first day of period).
32	94	I'm on my 2nd pack of Sprintec and the biggest side effect I have gotten is bad acne around my jaw line and chin, cystic acne.
32	95	No nausea, no acne, no weight gain, no baby.
32	96	I took Sprintec for 4 months and it was a fine and dandy birth control for pain with cramps, but I couldn't take the cystic acne it brought on.
32	97	I never had acne before.
32	98	Other than that, good pill, but too much acne.
32	99	It has given me a bit more acne than I normally have, but the biggest thing that has been a problem for me is the nauseous feeling that comes with it.
32	100	I have virtually no acne.
32	101	Also, it has cleared my skin of acne noticeably well.
32	102	Virtually no acne.
32	103	I started taking it for acne, which it does help with, but no ones skin will ever be perfect.
32	104	It has helped my acne I little bit but I'm also on acne medication.
32	105	I began experiencing acne breakouts on my face and very sudden mood swings, which I had not experienced on Amethia.
32	106	It has helped my minor acne greatly and also lightened my very heavy period so that now it is average and doesn't last 8 days!
32	107	It has been amazing for acne, my face is really clear now.
32	108	I don't receive bad cramps anymore and my acne doesn't come around when my period is here.
32	109	Never had acne but I break out less often.
32	110	I had little acne here and there now my skin is flawless.
32	111	I started it for my acne and the first month on it I was getting used to it so I was sad for a week or two but once i adjusted I have had absolutely zero side effects and it has helped with my acne tremendously.
32	112	My period is shorter and lighter, no acne either.
32	113	The only thing that has continued is mild acne.
32	114	I've only noticed some breast tenderness and mild acne.
32	115	No weight gain, no breast enlargement, no acne.
32	116	I have barely had any acne at all, maybe one here and there.
32	117	In the beginning my acne immediately cleared up- I've never had clear skin in my life!
32	118	I have much less acne than I used to.
32	119	No acne though.
32	120	I have chronic migraines and I haven't had any increase in them or anymore acne than normal.
32	121	I didn't get acne or nausea or mood swings or weight gain, but a 24 day long period (and counting) is definitely not what I signed up for.
32	122	I had very light periods, (which was nice) but I started to get horrible acne, and nausea.
32	123	The acne is completely gone, and so is the nausea.
32	124	Before I had really bad acne so I used Proactive (which worked good for me) and so far the pill has not made me break out.
32	125	My first month I had really bad acne and my brests were very sore.
32	126	This is my sixth month on Sprintec for acne.
32	127	My acne is a thousand times better and it's so relieving to have clear skin.
32	128	I've been taking it for about 5 years and haven't had any issues with acne, weight gain, mood swings, depression, sexual mood decreasing or any of the other issues some women have experienced.
32	129	It keeps my acne under control so I love it.
32	130	My acne is slowly disappearing.
32	131	Ii am 17 years old and being a teenager, I have terrible acne breakouts, monthly periods and hormonal swings.
32	132	My acne has still not improved either.
32	133	My cramps are less severe, my acne has improved.
32	134	I loved the fact that with TriSprintec, my breasts were bigger and I had very little acne, but it made me change into an emotional crazy person I didn't recognize.
32	135	However, it does not seem to help my very stubborn moderate acne.
32	136	Overall, this is a very good pill if you are small, want a lower dose pill, and don't have acne.
32	137	My acne has gotten 10 times worse and my hair has been falling out all over the place.
32	138	I did not have bad acne, weight gain, bad cramps, headaches, nausea, etc.
32	139	I started on Yaz specifically to control my severe acne, and heavy periods, and it turned me into a MONSTER.
32	140	Once I had been on the Sprintec, a bit of my acne came back.
32	141	I usually don't get acne but this pill has caused horrible breakouts all over my face.
32	142	I have never had acne before but now that I've been on Sprintec my forehead has been spotting.
32	143	The first month I had a decreased sex drive, and my acne basically disappeared.
32	144	After my period I decided not to use it because I started taking antibiotics to fix my facial acne, my skin actually got noticeably worse, my sex drive decreased, and I got a yeast infection.
32	145	I took Sprintec for 3 1/2 years consecutively and it prevented pregnancy and cleared up my acne quite a bit.
32	146	When I first started using it I broke out all over my face and I hadn't had problems with acne since I was 14 and on top of that it made me depressed and very moody.
32	147	I have also noticed that my skin has been much more oily this time around and I have been getting acne increasingly on my face and upper back.
32	148	I have not had any problems with acne, abnormal cramping, lack of sex drive, or anything else.
32	149	I've been taking Sprintec for a couple months and from the first week I started I had horrible acne breakouts.
32	150	I feel like i have a loss of apetite and acne was absolutly horrible and i never had acne before.
32	151	It hasn't made me sick or caused acne.
32	152	The only problem I have is that it seems like I have more acne than I did before I went on birth control.
32	153	I had minor acne before and after the first few weeks, my skin was completely cleared up.
32	154	Since taking Sprintec I feel my mood has greatly improved, I no longer get sick/nauseous, my cramps have become more than tolerable, and I noticed no increased acne or weight gain.
32	155	I was originally put on birth control to slow down my breast growth (one kept growing while the other did not) and not only did it help with that, but I have never gotten crazy acne, my periods are almost always on time and last 3-5 days, and I have not gotten any cramps or weight gain from being on it.
32	156	It actually cleared up the acne I had before I started it and it kept me from getting pregnant.
32	157	It has made me depressed, crazy, gain weight, no period, lactate, acne break outs, and no sex drive at all.
32	158	The acne has stayed away.
32	159	Has worked as contraceptive.... but I developed acne, tender breasts, nausea.
32	160	I never have acne and within days of taking the first pill I started breaking out.
32	161	HOWEVER, my acne has worsened a lot.
32	162	If you don't have acne, I'd recommend it.
32	163	I have been on it for 2 weeks and I have been cramping horrible every single day, I've been so bloated, so tired, so moody, my anxiety I through the roof, I've been breaking out like no other.
32	164	I'm done with a months worth so far and noticed that I'm slightly breaking out.
32	165	At first I was breaking out on my face but it's going away,  the only negative thing I can really say is that I'm always hungry and craving junk food and soda ...I've only had sex once since I've been on it but used condom afraid not to use condom I just had a baby..not expensive !
32	166	I got off of the pill for a couple months and lost the weight but I started breaking out so I went back on the pill to regulate my period and stress.. this time I hate it!!
32	167	I had a good experience with Sprintec with no symptoms at all, other than some bad breaking out during the first two months.
32	168	I've become more moody, losing weight (which for me isn't a plus because I'm trying to gain weight lol ) and has my face breaking out.
32	169	My back cramps were consistant while on them, and my face started breaking out so bad, ive even had a few zits on my back which i normally never get.
32	170	I did experience probably the worst mood swings of my life, and strangely enough, my upper thighs have been breaking out in pimples, which I didn't correlate to my birth control until reading other comments.
32	171	I've been on it for 3 weeks now and my skin is usually very clear, but within 2 days of starting Sprintec I started severely breaking out and nothing will clear it up.
32	172	My skin started breaking out, my periods were heavy and my emotions were out of control.
32	173	It regulated it, I had less cramps, less bleeding, no pimples, no weight gain.
32	174	I have like 10 under the skin pimples 24/7 and I'm in constant pain.
32	175	I've been on sprintec for about a year and a half, no weight gain, cleared up any pimples, 5 day long periods, and no pregnancies.
32	176	I've been on it for almost three weeks now, and the only issues I have been having are more pimples that I have ever had in my life.
32	177	I would have patches of pimples on my chin and by my hairline.
32	178	This did nothing for cramps either.
32	179	My cramps have decreased and usually will only be really bad on the first day of my period.
32	180	My cramps are worse than they have ever been, I'm constantly feeling sick and it didn't not lighten my flow at all and clotting has gotten worse.
32	181	I would get light headed and my cramps would be so bad to the point of almost passing out (I never had this issue before).
32	182	I have random pains in my abdomen that feel like cramps even when I'm not on my period.
32	183	I had absolutely heavy flow whenever my period hit, cramps that made me double over in pain, and it was to the point that I had trouble walking normal due to my period being so heavy.
32	184	My periods have been shorter with a vast decrease in cramps.
32	185	This birth control has caused me to get worse cramps than when I was on my last birth control.
32	186	I had a 2 week period that wouldn't stop then had one day of freedom now I'm back to stomach cramps and spotting which just started.
32	187	I'm taking them to control heavy periods and cramps, depression and being tired.
32	188	My doctor prescribed Sprintec to me because of cramps (like the type that make you throw up, wake you up in the middle of night, etc...).
32	189	I started spotting on Wednesday and got horrible horrible cramps.
32	190	Now it's a full on period and my cramps are unbearable.
32	191	Not to mention I've been bleeding for two weeks straight with crazy heavy cramps.
32	192	A little sore but lil bit bigger boobs, slight nausea but eating fixes it, less appetite, a couple tiny headaches and some cramps for two days in the first week but nothing after that, spotting for two weeks straight basically but very light, skin already looks clearer I think, more energy.
32	193	I wake up in the middle of the night with menstrual cramps all throughout the month.
32	194	I used to get light back cramps when I got my period before taking this and I'd say they have increased in intensity but I only get them one day now.
32	195	I notice when I do not get much exercise that month I have minor cramps.
32	196	I am used to heavy periods because I have endometriosis but this was the worst along with very painful cramps.
32	197	I also don't have as many cramps as I used to.
32	198	I'm having the heaviest period of my life (5 days in and still absurd cramps, constant heavy flow- TMI sorry).
32	199	A year later and now I barely have cramps and my period is super light, even with being a day longer.
32	200	My skin has been clear, my cramps gone, weight even, no period sickness, and I have not become pregnant while on it.
32	201	The side effects I encountered was clearer skin, better sleep, less cramps, lighter periods, higher sex drive, less migraines, more energy, decrease in my PMS symptoms and a better mood in general.
32	202	My cramps have nearly disappeared and my bleeding is no where near as heavy.
32	203	My period is always late and I get awful cramps.
32	204	Waking up in the middle of the night 2 or 3 times to change, along with the worst cramps ever.
32	205	I love this, I've only been using Sprintec since the end of July, I was put on it after having my first child and since being on it my period is regular its not as heavy as it use to be and I hardly have cramps before birth control and before pregnancy my cramps were unbearable but now I hardly have any I wouldn't switch to anything else love this
32	206	I used to have extremely painful cramps during my period and 7-8 day long periods.
32	207	But,  on the down side they were heavy for the first few days with strong fatigue and cramps.
32	208	I started this pill 4 months ago for my cramps and nothing has changed cramps are still the same and my period is still really heavy.
32	209	I've never had a pregnancy scare, never any horrible side effects, and helped control my cramps and period.
32	210	Also my period was heavy at the first month, but through the 2nd and 3rd month it gets lighter and lighter, as well with cramps.
32	211	Seemed to have eased my cramps when it came to my period.
32	212	I do think it made my cramps less intense and my period lighter.
32	213	The cramps have me doubling over and feeling as if I may vomit.
32	214	I was only on it for about 3 months but I was extremely moody, had constant headaches, weight gain(about 30 pounds), heavy bleeding, and very painful cramps.
32	215	Paired with nausea, and almost 24/7 cramps.
32	216	My flow is light and my cramps  barely occur on the first day!
32	217	I have stomach and back cramps 24/7 everytime I eat I want to vomit I've been very moody and feel more depressed than usual.
32	218	I've been on some form of BC since age 19 to control horrible cramps and prevent ovarian cysts, and I'm 27 now.
32	219	I didn't like how it made my periods and cramps way worse but over the months it's calmed down.
32	220	It amazing when it comes to getting your period I used to have severe cramps I could never go to work, now when I get it I don't even realize i have it.
32	221	I had VERY LITTLE break through bleeding for a short week, and little cramps the first night.
32	222	It did keep me on a strict period schedule and took most of my severe cramps and bleeding away, which was amazing.
32	223	Since taking it I suffered from extreme nausea and bleeding irregularly followed by cramps that didn't seem tied to my period.
32	224	Unfortunately this made my cramps worse the week before my period but other than that it's been great!
32	225	I have no mood swings or cramps and my period is predictable and comes on the same day each month.
32	226	it's work perfect, periods are like and I barely get cramps.
32	227	I have NO cramps which is huge for me because they used to be almost debilitating.
32	228	But I hate the cramps I get when I'm on my period.
32	229	For the entire first month I experienced horrible stomach cramps, extreme bloating to where my lower abdomen felt like a rock hard balloon, headaches (I never get headaches) as well as dizziness.
32	230	My periods are light, I've never really had cramps so I can't say anything there.
32	231	Period have become lighter with less cramps and my breasts have gotten fuller.
32	232	I have been experiencing cramps on and off (like period cramps).
32	233	On the negative side, I experience PMS-like symptoms on the last two weeks of active pills... Bloating, cramps, swelling of breasts; etc.
32	234	I started the pack two weeks after my period and I did get my period 2 weeks late but it was super heavy the first two days and I have really bad cramps.
32	235	But it did relieve my cramps and heavy bleeding, which is the reason I started taking it.
32	236	The cramps feel like I am going through a really bad period.
32	237	I didn't gain any weight, periods became shorter, lighter periods and I rarely have cramps & if I do they aren't bad.
32	238	Before I got on Sprintec I had really heavy periods, all 7 days long & horrible cramps to the point where I would miss school and work.
32	239	Oh & the most important thing I Love love Love about this pill, ladies if you have bad cramps let's say, 1-10 a 8-10 I highly recommend this pill because by the first month my cramps wasn't bad at all it went to a 5.
32	240	I hardly ever get cramps and on this it's pretty much cramps so often that I want to double over in pain.
32	241	I have absolutely no cramps (although I did when I stopped taking it for a little while).
32	242	When im in my period my crampa actually worsened, and id often get terrible leg cramps that would wake me up in dead sleep.
32	243	But fortunately the leg cramps disappeared a few months in.
32	244	I've only experienced cramps one period in my life which was a couple of months ago, but I think it was due to stress.
32	245	I read so many great reviews on having light cramps and moods are fine and no swelling but this pill has done complete opposite for me.
32	246	My hands have shown signs of swelling lately, my moods are beyond horrible and scary, and my cramps have been bad.
32	247	I was on a different pill for three months and it gave me horrible cramps and headaches and once I switched back to Sprintec they went away.
32	248	My doctor put me on Sprintec after trying several other pills for birth control and my horrible cramps.
32	249	My cramps used to be unbearable and kept me home from work each month, now I can manage them with a heating pad and a few Advil (instead of taking up to 10 a day).
32	250	It was prescribed by my doctor to ease my menstrual cramps and it did that and so much more.
32	251	I have almost no cramps during my period which is a huge from before because I used to sit in pain for hours.
32	252	But now I have the worst cramps ever.
32	253	Also, I have never experienced cramps as badly as I did on this pill.
32	254	My side effects were tender breasts & mild cramps the week leading up to my period, and then I'd get a headache on the day of my period, which was ok with me as it warns me it was coming.
32	255	I like it because it has prevented pregnancy and I barely have any period cramps.
32	256	No bad side effects, just good ones like clear skin, no cramps, light periods, etc.
32	257	I have no cramps or bad side effects.
32	258	My periods are much less painful (no cramps) and shorter (a few days).
32	259	Before I began taking Sprintec I always had horrifying cramps at the beginning of my period each month, now I barely have any at all.
32	260	Can I say.... awful cramps?
32	261	Never in my life have I had cramps like these!
32	262	I have little to no PMS (used to have lots of cramps, bloating, moodiness, fatigue, breakouts, breast tenderness).
32	263	My periods are lighter and shorter, plus the cramps don't hurt nearly as bad as they used to.
32	264	But with Sprintec I can always count on my period being the same time every month down to the day, it is also a very mild period and my cramps are about the same as they were.
32	265	It has also made my cramps ten times worse, and I start developing ulcers in my mouth a week before my period, and sometimes during.
32	266	The cramps were unbearable.
32	267	I feel constantly irritated or easily frustrated whenever I take it, and I have noticed that I have painful cramps more frequently than I used to.
32	268	I had everything from leg cramps, arm cramps, unbelievable mood swings to the point you wanted to hit someone, month long spotting and 24/7 nausea and weight loss.
32	269	My doctor took me off it at the mention of leg cramps and put me on Sprintec.
32	270	Not bad cramps but I just feel like something is going on.
32	271	I like it, my periods are regular, I hardly ever get cramps anymore.
32	272	I only have minor cramps which is normal and so far the only side effect is I feel hungry after taking the pill at night.
32	273	I've been getting bad cramps for the last couple of days too, and I'm not even on my period.
32	274	I started taking Sprintec at 15, and have been taking it for a little over a year now, because my dermatologist recommended it, and said it would help regulate my period and stop cramps.
32	275	I was prescribed Sprintec to help lighten my HEAVY periods and relieve me of the excruciating pain from cramps that came with it.
32	276	My period is normal to light and my cramps are finally bearable.
32	277	I get no serious side effects, does not decrease my sex drive or make me dry, I get no cramps, no weight gain.
32	278	I never did have cramps so no change there.
32	279	No cramps.
32	280	I have no cramps, no bloating, etc.
32	281	The only thing I notice about my period is the blood, which is a huge plus because I used to get cramps and feel crappy.
32	282	This one has been the worst yet... instead of my periods getting lighter, they now last 7  days with severe cramps for the first couple of days.
32	283	Since I've been on the pill, my periods have become extremely regular, HOWEVER, I get worse cramps and bloating than I ever had before.
32	284	After my first month I had a very heavy period, but since then it has been slowing down, but I'm still getting cramps.
32	285	I couldn't take the pill unless I already ate or was about to eat because it made me feel light headed and my legs be cramping and stomach cramps worse then normal.
32	286	I have had random cramps that are debilitating.
32	287	I used to get really bad cramps before I started Sprintec to the point where I'd throw up or start balling my eyes out, but now they're very slight cramps, or non-existent.
32	288	No problems - at first had great sex drive, 4 day periods, no cramps, light.
32	289	I have only been taking this medicine for 7 days and all I have been having is cramps.
32	290	Periods are fair, the normal slight cramps, nothing extreme, the usual, then I'm back to to normal.
32	291	My cramps and mood swings are much better, and I only experienced cramping between periods for the first 2-3 months.
32	292	Get dull cramps daily and was worried about it until I read these other posts.
32	293	Before I would have horrible cramps and be sick for the first 3 days but now nothing happens at all.
32	294	No more cramps, just a headache and some slight fatigue on day 1 and 2.
32	295	Last night I woke up because of cramping was up for 1 1/2 hours with really painful cramps in my back and pelvic area.
32	296	This is my second month of Sprintec and I have had severe hair loss, cramps all the time, which seems to last all day sometimes.
32	297	I was not prepared for the killer cramps, migraines, nausea, throwing up, loss of appetite, extreme mood swings.
32	298	Shorter periods, less cramps, great skin, so cheap, and never any spotting (only when I skipped my period on purpose, I spotted a week later for 2 weeks).
32	299	My periods are longer than they've ever been, even while off birth control and while my cramps aren't as severe during that time I have cramps all the time it seems.
32	300	The most notable side effect is the cramps.
32	301	Even though I'm not on my period, I have terrible cramps that makes it feel like I am!
32	302	I get no cramps, very little bloating, a very light period that only lasts 2-3 days, and no mood changes.
32	303	It doesn't help my cramps, nor does it help my moodiness around "that time," in fact it's made it worse.
32	304	I woke up at three in the morning due to stomach cramps, which I have never had happen before on my period.
32	305	But nOW I have severe cramps for my whole period, which lasts for 10 days.
32	306	Before this I would get very moody, get menstrual migraines, have really bad cramps, and when I was 18 I started getting nauseous/sick every other month within the first couple of days of my period.
32	307	Not to mention the cramps I would get during my period.
32	308	I was put on Sprintec a month ago to help regulate my peroid and help with the severe cramps.
32	309	In the last month I have had a loss of appetite, lack of energy, two UTI's, a yeast infection, and severe cramps.
32	310	Sprintec did help calm my severe cramps but I can't stand these yeast infections.
32	311	I was having severe cramps and long, heavy periods.
32	312	After the first 2 months or so, my periods are lighter and shorter, and I rarely have cramps.
32	313	It was reg/light flow but the cramps are horrible.
32	314	I've never had cramps like that and it lasted for six days straight not to mention I'm going on 10 days still bleeding a regular flow and it doesn't look to lighten up anytime soon.
32	315	My cramps are severe.
32	316	Otherwise, I cramp, bloat & have migraines.
32	317	I'm 21 don't diet or exercise always weight around 129lb and my period light 3 day period with painful cramp on 1st day.
32	318	Monday I started this pill and 3 days later Thursday night I was in bed with really bad cramp that I never had before and painkiller didn't work much.
32	319	I do cramp, but lighter than off OC.
32	320	I cramp off and on through out the day.
32	321	At first I liked it because I did not cramp as much.
32	322	Taken for painful cramping.
32	323	However, after about 5 months without my period I started cramping really bad and felt super bloated which made me think I was pregnant.
32	324	I have to say it's helped the depression and the being tired but I'm still having heavy periods and cramping.
32	325	I don't have bad cramping like I use too.
32	326	The day before and the first 2 days of my period I get some heavy cramping and get emotional, but otherwise I am fine.
32	327	Well my Dr gave me this to help my periods first day was yesterday I had Terriable pain in my back and cramping it didn't start til I took this pill I couldn't sleep I was in too much pain
32	328	For someone who is in good health, happy, exercises, and has never experience bad cramping, I've experienced : horrible mood swings, weight gain, enlarged breasts, and awful cramping.
32	329	I don't have any cramping or breast tenderness either.
32	330	I have experienced irregular bleeding, heavier than normal bleeding, cramping, my skin looks worse than it ever has, the bloating is TERRIBLE - I have gained 15 pounds since starting this pill, I've had more headaches, severe fatigue, and have been just down right moody.
32	331	I've been on this pill for about one year, and my one complaint is I have NO sex drive at all, mild cramping and my periods are shorter although heavy bleeding.
32	332	I went on bc to control my emotional balance and heavy cramping for my period.
32	333	My first week of this pill I had major cramping, it went away but I've been bleeding non stop.
32	334	The positives- regular period, no weight gain, no breakthrough bleeding, no more cramping, no co-pay, and NO babies!
32	335	It's eased my period symptoms (terrible cramping and fatigue) and proven highly effective as a birth control.
32	336	I would have intense cramping on the first day of my period but if I caught it early it was easily controlled with ibuprofen.
32	337	I get nausea as well as cramping, both stomach and back.
32	338	I didn't have any cramping,nausea,fatigue, etc.
32	339	No cramping.
32	340	Prior to taking Sprintec, I had HORRIBLE periods: heavy cramping, heavy flow, etc.
32	341	Sprintec reduced my cramping and heavy flow.
32	342	They tear easy now, but the debilitating cramping has completed subsided which is why I take the pills.
32	343	I had absolutely no cramping while on my period, no weight gain and beautiful skin.
32	344	When I first got on it I had cramping for about a week and then it was fine.
32	345	No weight gain, no pregnancy scares, and reduced cramping.
32	346	Also, my periods are regular and I have very minimal bleeding, cramping, etc.
32	347	It worked great for stopping that but I traded in the bleeding for serve cramping.
32	348	I had irregular periods and bar cramping; both of those problems were fixed once again by the second month of pills.
32	349	I did experience mood swings especially when I would have my periods I guess in that sense it was a bit bad I'd cry or get mad VERY easily and I did experience cramping during my cycle.
32	350	I always feel like I'm cramping.
32	351	Constant cramping.
32	352	The cramping was horrible last month but it was the first month since I switched from Zovia.
32	353	I had a regular period when I was supposed to then a week later started again-very light flow dark it lasted for 2 weeks but no cramping.
32	354	Negative effects that I had were uncomfortable cramping the week before and after I took the inactive pills, a period that lasted 8 1/2 days, and bad clotting during my period.
32	355	I haven't had any breakthrough bleeding or anything like that or cramping.
32	356	Alongside this I have been bloated, cramping, my skin has broken out, and my moods have been horrible.
32	357	Sprintec reduced my periods to exactly 7 days, I never had spotting in between my periods.
32	358	Only thing I had was spotting and nausea in the beginning of taking them.
32	359	My periods (usually spotting or light period) start on Wednesday and usually is gone by Saturday.
32	360	No spotting but I am extremely moody and I got on the pill to help my face stay clear, but all it has done is make my face break out extremely bad.
32	361	Also never got more than a little spotting during my inactive pills.
32	362	Experienced minor spotting the week before my period.
32	363	The only side effects I have encountered are, slight migraines the week before I start the sugar pill & VERY LIGHT spotting for a day about 1 week before I start the sugar pill.
32	364	I had spotting the first month.
32	365	I've been on sprintec for about 2 weeks and haven't had any spotting, my only complaint is migraines that I got 2 nights straight.
32	366	It was effective in preventing pregnancy and I did not get migraines or spotting.
32	367	Recently, I have been feeling not depressed but not happy and I started spotting like every day.
32	368	No spotting.
32	369	At first it started off as spotting so I didn't really care much (before being on this method my periods were horrible).
32	370	At the beginning typical symptoms occurred such as nausea and spotting, but after a couple of weeks these symptoms faded away.
32	371	A week in and I was getting a headache after every pill, along with nausea, bloating, spotting, and just a general feeling of being constantly hungover.
32	372	I am spotting constantly.
32	373	As far as physical side effects I only had spotting the first few months which is normal.
32	374	I've be on this BC for 3 weeks now iv been spotting for about a week now I start the white pills tomorrow a little nausea after taking the pill but I'm sure it's because of empty stomach but other then that no other problems
32	375	Best of all no spotting.
32	376	I recently had to switch to a new pill due to spotting between periods.
32	377	However, last week I took my pill only 2 hours late and I started spotting again as well as getting bad headaches, so definitely try to take it at the same time no matter what.
32	378	It wasn't late I started out with spotting and then what was like a normal flow.
32	379	Also, my period used to be such a heavy flow but the period I had this month was 3 days - the first and last were basically just spotting, and the middle day was a pretty light flow.
32	380	I have had no pregnancy scares, no hormonal mood swings, and very little spotting in between period weeks.
32	381	I had a bit of spotting, but not much.
32	382	I didn't have any spotting like I've had with previous pills.
32	383	I get a little bit of spotting, but it's not bad.
32	384	I would bleed every week for 3 or 4 days and it wasn't like I was spotting, it was almost a full on period.
32	385	I have been bleeding since the day I started taking ranging from spotting to heavy.
32	386	No spotting at all while taking the active pills, and no yeast infections.
32	387	I have been on different birth control before which caused spotting for two weeks before my period, Sprintec hasn't caused this problem at all.
32	388	I have experienced a little spotting here and there but other than that it has worked very well with my body.
32	389	I started taking sprintec to control my spotting between periods and obviously as birth control.
32	390	Since being on it i bled all 3 weeks on the regular pills and had worse spotting than before.
32	391	I've never had any spotting during my active pills.
32	392	Went to the doctor they said this was perfectly normal, a week went past no bleeding, then started spotting again, this lasted for 3 days.
32	393	The first week I took the active pills, I was am fine, no spotting.
32	394	The doctor told me I may experience nausea or spotting but so far I haven't and my period has been on time!
32	395	I have been having breakthrough bleeding (which started similar to a very light period and is now down to some spotting) for about 2 weeks now.
32	396	No sex drive, And made me spot for months .
32	397	My first one made me spot for weeks on end, so I was switched.
32	398	I was recently on the Junel birth control but I continued to spot for 5 months and that was sooooooooo aggravating.
32	399	Didn't even spot the first few months....YAY!
32	400	I would spot sometimes.
32	401	At first I spotted a lot and my boobs would always hurt, now I get my period twice a month sometimes.
32	402	After switching to Sprintec I no longer spotted between periods, got my period on time, got my sex drive back and no more mood swings.
32	403	I've Been taking Sprintec for a month now  andwhen I started the white pills I spotted for 5 days and my periods got heavier.
32	404	The first few days I was really nauseous, had a headache the 1st day, and I still don't have a strong appetite.
32	405	Today was my third day on it, this morning I had a bad headache and complete lost of appetite.
32	406	CONSTANT headache, super nauseous all the time, I have no energy whatsoever, tons of problems with my contact lenses, im dizzy all the time, lost partial vision in my right eye for about 1 day, I don't have a sex drive anymore.
32	407	In fact I've not even had a headache or any stomach pain.
32	408	I'd take sore boobs & headache over mood swings any day!
32	409	And every once in a while I get a headache.
32	410	I also constantly have a headache but overall it's working like it should!
32	411	There's no difference in my skin (still pretty clear), and I get headaches periodically.
32	412	Within the first few days I was having horrible headaches as well as mood swings and extreme irritability.
32	413	When I first started take Sprintec, I had mild headaches for the first 3 months.
32	414	The first week I was a little nauseous and had some headaches but that could be due to stress not the pill.
32	415	Anyone experience severe headaches in the eye and the pupil dilates?
32	416	But I went to a new gyno and she changed my prescription to Sprintec because she said the microgestin was what was giving me headaches.
32	417	Emotionally numb, headaches, constant anxiety, nonexistent sex drive.
32	418	After 3 years all the sudden that caused me to start having terrible headaches and a lump in my breast which went away.
32	419	It works well at prevention, no more headaches,  my boobs have been sore and have grown almost a full cup size in just 2 months.
32	420	On the first day I already have insomnia and it made it worse my depression increased and I started to have bad headaches throughout the day.
32	421	I experienced horrible stomach pains, nausea, headaches, loss of appetite, and depression.
32	422	I experienced nausea, some breast pain, extreme headaches, and I gained 15 pounds in the first 3 months.
32	423	During the first month I had very bad headaches vey frequently but that month was worth it because now I feel great and have no side effects.
32	424	I was constantly dizzy and had horrible headaches.
32	425	I had nausea, headaches, and I felt like I had morning sickness from being pregnant.
32	426	After every period for about 4 to 7 days I always felt nauseous and had headaches.
32	427	I constantly felt nauseous and ill, I literally had headaches on a daily basis.
32	428	But after that week I was totally fine except I started having really bad headaches.
32	429	I started taking SPRINTEC 5 months ago because a have no insurance here and I feel so terrible now, dizzy, no energy, headaches.
32	430	In addition to the gained weight I am nauseous ALL THE TIME and have constant headaches.
32	431	Worse birth control, I have been taking it for 2 weeks and I am already experiencing horrid headaches, I'm nauseous and I feel like I have something just sitting in my stomach.
32	432	I always take the pill before bed so I didn't Notice any headaches or weird feelings.
32	433	I was on sprintec for 3 months and I started getting very bad headaches Daily but I didn't think anything of them because I recently have tried to cut out my caffeine.
32	434	Almost everyday i have massive headaches where I just have to go in my room and sit in the dark.
32	435	Not any more or less moody than I have been and no headaches or pains.
32	436	I'm always nauseated especially when I first take it, I feel sick like I'm coming down with the flu all day, I get bad headaches every night after taking them, and I'm extremely depressed and Moody.
32	437	I love this birth control since the ring made me really sick, gain weight, intense headaches, and made me bleed for two months straight at a time.
32	438	I would recommend that you eat something before taking the pill to avoid headaches.
32	439	At first it was giving me headaches so I started to take it right before bed.
32	440	More headaches and body pain.
32	441	Well that's for me basically but other then that, I haven't been feeling nauseous as much though, but that's only when it's close to my period, I don't get headaches, no swelling, no gain in weight, it's just perfect for me.
32	442	At first it started off as frequent headaches and then dizzy spells and then increase in mood swings.
32	443	The dizziness and headaches.
32	444	My complaints with this birth control would have to be the constant headaches and my sex drive has decreased quite a bit.
32	445	I would say my most common side effects are sudden onset nausea and headaches.
32	446	Does the job I haven't gotten pregnant, but in the 3 months I have been taking it I have been experiencing breakout bleeding, headaches almost every morning, nausea, weight gain, and feeling overly emotional.
32	447	I don't get as many headaches but I have been getting random body pains.
32	448	No headaches or mood changes like with other birth control pills.
32	449	I have been on Sprintec for about 2 weeks and every time I take it I get bad headaches and my breasts have been so tender.
32	450	The symptoms I have experienced are enlarged breasts, (36D to almost 36DDD), bloating, increased sex drive, slight headaches and nausea.
32	451	I have gained weight, back pain, headaches and most of all lack of energy!
32	452	The last 3 months I have noticed headaches about the week before my period started but I figured this is due to getting older.
32	453	I have horrible headaches and feel like I might pass out, although I can't say for certain these are from taking Sprintec.
32	454	I'm not sure if this is related or not, but I've been a little restless during sleep and have mild headaches more often.
32	455	I don't feel hungry as often because I almost constantly feel nauseous and have headaches.
32	456	I have a heavier flow and I actually also ended up getting a migraine which actually never happened when I was on the old birth control.
32	457	From the first month until 6 month that I took the pills I have experienced the worst migraine ever.
32	458	After that my migraine went away and came back right away after taking it.
32	459	However ever since taking the sprintec I will occasionally get the same sickening migraine but it will be one day of the month now.
32	460	I was hospitalized for a SEVERE migraine that has lasted a whole month now!
32	461	However I stopped taking it after the fourth night because it gave me such terrible anxiety, a migraine every night and mood swings like crazy.
32	462	I was on it for six months, had migraines and vomiting every period, unexplainable tingliness in hands and lower extremeties... and then May 23, 2017 I go to ER for pain in chest and difficulty breathing, they diagnosed me with pulmonary embolisms, heart damage and a lung infarction.
32	463	I have horrible migraines almost every day which seem to get worse.
32	464	I get migraines, high blood pressure.
32	465	I'm also very emotional ALL the time ( I just cried because a noise startled me) in the beginning I also experienced horrible migraines that all I wanted to do was stay in the dark, but thats nothing new since being on this pill considering I just want to lay in bed all day anyway.
32	466	I had the worst migraines, mood swings and depression.
32	467	The migraines were so horrible it make me throw up every time.
32	468	These migraines will last up to three days if I'm lucky if I'm not lucky it will last up to a whole week.
32	469	It has been six months since and I am still having migraines due to taking the sprintec.
32	470	I get severe migraines and stomach pain on it.
32	471	Gave me lung clot symptoms, migraines, thyroid pains and the worst stomach ailments I've ever had.
32	472	Before I had heavy bleeding during 7 day long periods and sever migraines the day before, now I bleed lightly for 3 days and the migraines are gone.
32	473	I'm on my third month of it and overall my mood has improved and the migraines and heavy bleeding ending has made it worth it for me.
32	474	My major problem would be the constant migraines.
32	475	I have had migraines, but I have them in my genetics so I am not blaming the pill!
32	476	I'm only almost done with my third week and I'm having the worst ovary pains and migraines.
32	477	I've never had trouble with head aches or migraines until now.. My whole expience has been terrible.
32	478	I am a person that typically has a strong stomach, however this birth control makes me have the worst migraines and I start feeling nauseous everyday around 1pm.
32	479	At first I just got nauseous then I started getting migraines which were intense and the depression was horrible I was so emotional over stupid things.I got my second pack and took it at 7pm woke up at 8am and felt fine but around 12 I felt bad .I was so weak I couldn't move and I was sweating and cold and my arm went numb and it felt like I had a hang over but worse.
32	480	My period was so much lighter, but it lasted 6 days( which is not normal for me) After the first month, I started getting migraines.
32	481	I took Sronyx for about two or three months, which I had to stop due to the intense migraines it caused.
32	482	It made me have horrible migraines, so I stopped after the third month.
32	483	Also, I have had migraines my whole life and they are GONE.
32	484	I did experience the migraines before my "period".
32	485	However, my husband noticed decreased sex drive and dryness, and I have to add pre-menstrual migraines, resistant to over the counter painkillers, which has never happened before.
32	486	I gained 28 pounds in less than 4 months, lost any sex drive I had left, and felt like a zombie- no emotions except instant anger in stupid situations.
32	487	Minimal weight gain, and no change to sex drive but that definitely doesn’t outweigh the fact that it completely changed my inner mood.
32	488	I can agree with these reviews though that it does affect my sex drive (I notice about 2 days into the sugar pills a difference).
32	489	Not to mention the lower sex drive, CRAZY mood swings  and getting dry down there.
32	490	I would have no sex drive and literally be so aggravated for no reason it’s killing my relationship.
32	491	Ive been losing even more hair than normal and it completely killed my sex drive.
32	492	I started feeling down a lot more often and it totally killed my sex drive which sucks because that is why I started taking it BUT it did do its job so I can't really complain.
32	493	Ever since I started the pill I've experienced feeling nauseous, vomiting, morning sickness, my sex drive was low and depression.
32	494	And my sex drive has been completely nonexistent making think something is incredibly wrong with me but it's just the birth control!
32	495	While taking this pill my sex drive has been almost non-existent.
32	496	I was constantly hot and could never get comfortable, hungry all the time, very low sex drive, suicidal thoughts, horrible night mares, depression and emotionally unstable.... To name a few!
32	497	My boobs have increased in size, my skin has absolutely NO active breakouts(just scaring now), I am happier, my skin is SO much less oily, and my sex drive has increased.
32	498	I have no sex drive, and if I do I immediately dry up which makes it difficult.
32	499	I have constant low energy, terrible bloating, little to no sex drive, and terrible emotions.
32	500	My face is a smooth porcelain complexion, I've lost several pounds, my sex drive has been gradually growing week by week, and my mood swings are dissipating.
32	501	I took Sprintec for about a year and experienced decreased sex drive and mood swings.
32	502	Once I stopped, my sex drive went way up and and I felt normal again.
32	503	My sex drive has taken a nose dive.
32	504	Not to mention my sex drive is completely nonexistent.
32	505	After being on it a full month I've experienced EXTREMELY low sex drive.
32	506	Also, I feel tired all the time and my sex drive is completely gone.
32	507	No sex drive .
32	508	I have a higher sex drive and not pregnant.
32	509	Sex drive is just fine, skin is always clear, and my mood is pretty much always chill!
32	510	I've gained 5ish pounds, have mood swings that are manageable, low sex drive, vomiting (after starting a new pack), and mild breakouts.
32	511	I swapped to Sprintec from Microgestin after having suicidal thoughts, weight gain and no sex drive.
32	512	Sprintec also made me depressed (with no sudicidal thoughts), no sex drive and caused me to gain another 15 pounds.
32	513	With the patch I have no depression, no suicidal thoughts, my appetite has gone back to how it was before I started birth control and my sex drive has returned.
32	514	Sex drive has plummeted.
32	515	I do not believe it did anything with my sex drive.
32	516	But the worst part, I have a decreased sex drive and when I have sex I dry up very quick which is so frustrating that I can't even enjoy my sex life while being on this pill.
32	517	This pill has been effective as far as controlling any pregnancy, but since I have been taking it my sex drive has lessened and I've become moody more often.
32	518	It did kill my sex drive though.
32	519	As soon as I stopped the pills my sex drive came back so it's been great.
32	520	For myself, the negatives that come with this drug are the feelings of a slower metabolism/bloating (although I haven't gained weight), and huge decrease in my sex drive which I actually prefer because now I play it coy in dating ;)
32	521	My sex drive is the same.
32	522	My sex drive has been back to normal and my personality is happy and normal again since switching to Sprintec!
32	523	The only thing that I have noticed is my sex drive isn't what it used to be, but it could just be me.
32	524	My sex drive has increased slightly, but otherwise my body tolerates it extremely well.
32	525	My sex drive increased a little bit that I noticed but pretty much the same I think.
32	526	Mood swings, sex drive is the same but have a very hard time reaching satisfaction, and my skin is very clear.
32	527	On the plus side- my face is very clear and my sex drive is normal; I also have very predictable, light and short periods.
32	528	My sex drive is through the roof, but my appetite hasn't been affected as far as I can tell.
32	529	However, something my boyfriend I both have noticed is that my sex drive has increased quite a bit, especially during the first couple months of taking!
32	530	My sex drive has not changed.
32	531	I have extreme mood swings however my body and face is beautiful and better than ever sex drive is pretty high and great for me.
32	532	I DO think they impact your sex drive though.
32	533	I'm 25 and my sex drive is almost completely gone.
32	534	Also it made my sex drive plummet,  I was not interested in anything sexual.
32	535	It obliterated my sex drive.
32	536	It has given me a higher sex drive too.
32	537	My breasts are larger but I haven't noticed a weight gain and it has not affected my sex drive.
32	538	About a week and a half off the pill my sex drive sky rocketed!
32	539	Now I'm realizing that the hormones were suppressing my sex drive.
32	540	My sex drive also had it's "mood swings" as well and that went away as well.
32	541	Super moody, depressed, no sex drive, nausea, weight loss, extremely tired, dizzy.
32	542	My sex drive has lowered and dryness is there.
32	543	I have NO sex drive whatsoever.
32	544	I am going now on my 2nd yr using this, and it's great, my sex drive is great probably got better too, I did not experience much weight gain that isn't normal.
32	545	The only drawbacks are decreased sex drive and annoying vaginal dryness.
32	546	My breasts are larger and I've had a little weight gain, but I'm SO emotional, and I have little to no sex drive which has its effects on my husband and me.
32	547	I have 0 sex drive and I'm only 21 years old.
32	548	NO issues with sex drive, tiredness, weight gain other than my breast.
32	549	I have not noticed a decrease in my sex drive.
32	550	I have very few complaints since it has done nothing to lower my sex drive or put me through any pain.
32	551	My sex drive is down which effects my husband and I's relationship.
32	552	I've been on Sprintec for going on 2 years and the longer I've been on it the more I've noticed that my sex drive is beyond low.
32	553	When I first started this pill I thought it was great and I have no other complaints other than the low sex drive, I am thinking about switching soon!
32	554	It's even increased my sex drive (which me and my boyfriend both love about it).
32	555	I am more emotional and I'm dry, so I don't have a sex drive like I used too.
32	556	The worst part is the severe lowering of sex drive.
32	557	I haven't had any weight loss or gain, and my mood and sex drive haven't been effected at all.
32	558	I'm fairly certain my sex drive has gone down.
32	559	On the Depo Provera I had almost no sex drive and was completely dry when having sex.
32	560	I don't eat as much, my sex drive has increased for someone who isn't active.
32	561	I'm really emotional and don't really have a sex drive.
32	562	My sex drive has increased a lot.
32	563	My sex drive was nothing.
32	564	First 3 months were bad, mood swings, loss of sex drive and nausea.
32	565	I have gained about 10lbs from it, and my sex drive is gone about halfway through activity.
32	566	From then on my sex drive has increased dramatically, and the only time I might break out is the week of my period, which lasts for about three days.
32	567	3. normal sex drive (sometimes on and sometimes off), 4.
32	568	Oh yeah and since I started my second pack my sex drive increased too.
32	569	My breasts are also sore and sex drive has decreased a little.
32	570	The only positive is my sex drive has experienced a huge boost and I have lost some weight.
32	571	My sex drive has not decreased, if anything it increased.
32	572	My boobs have also been very swollen and ive lost all sex drive whatsoever.
32	573	The only positive is that my sex drive has increased.
32	574	I was originally on Depo Provera shots, which stopped my normally sporadic and horrific periods completely but left me gaining weight dangerously fast and killed my sex drive, completely.
32	575	I haven't experienced any side effects except maybe higher sex drive.
32	576	No mood swings or anything though and I have noticed I haven't been eating as much and my sex drive has increased.
32	577	There hasn't been any change in my sex drive at all.
32	578	My fiance and I both agree that my sex drive has increased tremendously since I started taking Sprintec.
32	579	Sprintec gave me yeast infection, constant bleeding and loss of appetite, as well as sex drive.
32	580	I became irritable/depressed, no libido at all, and my face began to break out when I've never had skin problems.
32	581	I can't sleep, low libido sometimes.
32	582	After that day everything was normal except for bloating which was fine.My boobs have gotten slightly bigger & I've gained 5 lbs, which I wanted to gain weight.also I've been wanting sex a bit more, if some ladies are worried about their libido.
32	583	But it magnified my depression and anxiety causing me to have panic attacks never had that before this pill and made my libido with my husband of 2 years go down the tubes even made my relationship with him bad.
32	584	I've always had a low libido so I don't think changed MUCH (although my libido went way up after getting off of Sprintec).
32	585	My sexual urges visit me usually in my 2nd week after my period, so hasn't completely killed my libido.
32	586	The only serious issue is that my libido has seriously plummeted.
32	587	I feel like I have no energy and no libido.
32	588	My husband is really sick of the no libido thing though.
32	589	Then the weight gain which I didn’t mind.
32	590	I did start the pill when I was 19 and very thin, so college lifestyle could have contributed to the weight gain as well, but the pill definitely increased my appetite and I had exrtreme cravings during periods.
32	591	I would say over all not bad but definite weight gain.
32	592	I also experienced weight gain, which wasn't a problem.
32	593	I went up an entire cup size in that time, and finally got sick of dealing with the weight gain.
32	594	Overall, if you don't experience weight gain, it's probably fine for you, but didn't work for me.
32	595	I had no weight gain from the depo but I just didn't like the reviews I was reading and the fact I had no period freaked me out.
32	596	No weight gain, but I never get weight gain from birth control.
32	597	I was Aviane for roughly a year, it had the least amount of side effects, but stopped in 2014 because of weight gain & anxiety.
32	598	2 months ago the bloating and weight gain began.
32	599	This amount of weight gain doesn't add up.
32	600	Acne actually cleared up, no weight gain, or depression.
32	601	I thankfully haven't noticed any kind of significant weight gain or mood change...although at times I may tend to be slightly more overly-emotional, but it isn't severe like it was in the case of some other medications.
32	602	I experienced a small amount of weight gain and my breasts also became bigger.
32	603	No terrible side effects, a little weight gain.
32	604	Also, it never caused weight gain for me.
32	605	Within the first month of taking this I experienced severe gas pains, some weight gain, and an increase in appeitite.
32	606	No weight gain or weight lost.
32	607	Though, I have also gained about 30 pounds since I started taking this four years ago (most of the weight gain I contribute to my laziness and poor eating and just growing).
32	608	This worked well after a period of adjustment and never had any bad side effects, just a little weight gain.
32	609	I haven't experienced any weight gain.
32	610	I experienced a significant amount of weight gain, which I was unable to lose, even though I run and work out regularly.
32	611	Hoped this pill would lessen the ovarian tenderness and stop the weight gain (40 lbs in one year!)
32	612	Depressed, lethargic, moody, snappy, no appetitie but weight gain some how, constipation, white bumps on skin....nothing positive to report except that a little less dry than usual.
32	613	I workout about 5 times a week so I didn't notice any weight gain.
32	614	I've gone up an entire cup size, with very little weight gain elsewhere.
32	615	No weight gain, nausea or mood changes for me.
32	616	First month on this pill no weight gain so far .
32	617	I wasn't sure I was going to be able to remember and keep myself on track with the one pill a day but I set an alarm on my phone and have no problems, I've experienced a lot of weight gain (need to move up bra size, went up a size in jeans & shirts) but I'm happy about that because I was at 87lb in a month of taking it, I went to 102lb.
32	618	I'm not sure about weight gain yet but Minastrin was terrible, I gained about 15 pounds.
32	619	My appetite has increased considerably but I've had no major weight gain.
32	620	I have never experienced any weight gain while on this pill either.
32	621	I don't think I've had weight gain.
32	622	No weight gain or breast growth though!
32	623	No weight gain.
32	624	The only side effect I have noticed is weight gain.
32	625	Some weight gain, really bad mood swings during the first few months.
32	626	Weight gain has been maybe 5-7 pounds gained.
32	627	I have had weight gain but its a maintained gain but its been 100% effective, never been pregnant!
32	628	I had a little weight gain but that could also be attributed to campus food.
32	629	Nothing I did stopped the weight gain.
32	630	I am now going back on it hoping to stop the weight gain.
32	631	I have not experienced any weight gain.
32	632	I haven't experienced any weight gain or anything serious.
32	633	Since starting this pill my periods have been extremely light, no significant weight gain (about 5 pounds), and it is very effective at preventing pregnancy.
32	634	I've been on Sprintec for about 2 months, I recently noticed weight gain and really bad mood swings.
32	635	No weight gain, no mood changes.
32	636	I've been on it for about a month now, and I've experienced some weight gain but mostly in all the right areas.
32	637	Because of where the weight gain is, I suspect it's the pill because normally my weight fluctuates.
32	638	I have not gained any weight, but then again I am relatively thin and have never been prone to weight gain.
32	639	Not much weight gain though.
32	640	I had some weight gain when I first started using it but my period is always on time and it only lasts 3 days.
32	641	My skin is clear, I don't have much weight gain nor have I had a baby, but side effects are too much for me.
32	642	Overall I love this pill despite the little water weight gain.
32	643	I have had no mood swings or weight gain which is awesome.
32	644	I had horrible weight gain with other birth controls.
32	645	I had no side effects except a little weight gain in my breasts - I went from a 34 B to a 36 C. But every birth control has different effects on different girls.
32	646	No major mood swings or thoughts of suicide, no weight gain...actually this pill helps suppress my appetite, so I don't eat as much.
32	647	The reason I went off of it was because I had almost 40 lbs of weight gain.
32	648	I didn't experience any unusual mood swings or weight gain.
32	649	I have been on Sprintec for a month now, and have not had a problem with weight gain, but for the first 2-3 weeks my skin was terrible!
32	650	I have been on it for 6 months now and the only side effect I have had was a little bit of weight gain.
32	651	Other than the mysterious weight gain, Sprintec has done well for me.
32	652	I haven’t gained any weight or gotten bigger boobs.
32	653	Over the 4 years, I gained 40 pounds.
32	654	I also felt bloated and gained several pounds.
32	655	I was on it for three months, and in that time I gained almost 10 pounds.
32	656	I cry about nothing (used to be more in control of that) and I've gained 10 pounds in 6 months (without changing diet or exercise).
32	657	I've also gained weight and I'm careful with what I eat.
32	658	It's helped me maintain clear skin for the most part (still break out during that time of the month) and I haven't gained weight.
32	659	I have gained 4 lbs in 2 months.
32	660	I used sprintec for about a year and a half and I gained and immense amount of weight.
32	661	So far, I have not gained any weight at all.
32	662	I only gained 4 pounds which went to my boobs and butt.
32	663	I've gained about 10 pounds.
32	664	I gained117 lbs on depo and 73 on Norinyl I haven't gained an ounce on Sprintec.
32	665	I rate this a 5/10 because it's helped in the sense that I haven't gotten pregnant...but I've gained 10 pounds every month since taking it.
32	666	Just this past 4 months of being on it I've gained 25 pounds....
32	667	I haven't gained any weight and I don't have side effects.
32	668	In the first  2 weeks of taking these I gained 5 lbs easy.
32	669	I gained a ton of weight.
32	670	I'm sensitive to certain smells, I'm extremely bloated, and I gained 8 pounds in 3 weeks.
32	671	I have gained no weight and my periods come on time every month and last about 4 days.
32	672	I've gained about 15 pounds since being on birth control..
32	673	Literally the only other con of this pill is that I have gained about 5-7 lbs.
32	674	I've gained a couple pounds but not to many.
32	675	I gained no weight and it helped stop my breakouts.
32	676	I have not gained weight.
32	677	It's the third month and now I noticed that I gained weight but not a dramatic amount and I have gone up a size in my bra cup and my underwear and jeans.
32	678	I have a small flat belly and have only gained weight in the parts a girl would want, my boyfriend loves my body more than ever!
32	679	And honestly I have had zero side effects other than clearer skin and I've actually lost weight rather than gained weight (not sure if it's totally related to the pill or not) and my breasts have been a little sore but not unbearable so don't think too much about the reviews, and try it before you assume you'll be overly emotional and gain weight, it'll just vary but for me this has been awesome so far!
32	680	One big complaint I had about it is that I gained a whopping 20 pounds since I went on it.
32	681	I gained about 10lbs by about January (but I haven't gained since then due to changes in diet) and went up about 1.5-2 cup sizes (SO annoying since I'm an athlete).
32	682	I've never gained weight on Sprintec.
32	683	But once I got off it I gained weight.
32	684	I haven't gained any weight since on this (which was my main concern) but everyone will be different.
32	685	My best friend is also on Sprintec and she gained 20 pounds so it really is a case by case thing.
32	686	I have gained a significant amount of weight in the year I've been back on it (6lbs) despite no changes in diet or exercise.
32	687	I don't have much of an appetite, and I haven't gained weight in fact it helped the severe bloating I had.
32	688	The worst part about this birth control for me is that I've gained 20 pounds and it is noticeable.
32	689	It made my breasts bigger and I feel like I gained a little weight which I don't mind.
32	690	The one side effect that I absolutely HATE is that I'm always hungry and have gained some weight.
32	691	I've been on this for three months now and the noticed that I've gained about 10 pounds but some of it went to my chest (which I'm not complaining about considering I'm an A cup).
32	692	I gained weight and I sleep way more than I usually do.
32	693	I have gained a few pounds but not enough to complain about!
32	694	I have gained 4lbs in just 2 weeks.
32	695	I have gained at least 6 or 7 pounds in the last month and a half and I hate it.
32	696	I had the craziest mood swings, ate a lot (gained about 20-25lbs), and had brownish-red bloody discharge for months, it seemed like I bled for forever and I couldn't take it anymore.
32	697	I wake up starving, but by the time I get the chance to eat, I feel a little sick like I'm about to throw up, but I kind of think it's a good thing that I'm not eating as much, hopefully some of the weight I gained I can lose.
32	698	I haven't gained weight, my breasts have increased in size but are tender.
32	699	Only problem is I gained about 15 pounds and my breasts got HUGE.
32	700	My only concern is that I've gained about 5 to 10lbs since I've been taking them.
32	701	From the very beginning, the nausea was unbearable and painful, making me pass out at times.
32	702	I've only been on it for one month so far, but I've been constipated, bloated, and my eyes have been bugging me/ I got nauseous for the first two weeks of use, to the point that I had to take prescription medication for nausea.
32	703	The first month (more like week) I got the regular symptoms like nausea and vomiting but that's always been normal for me.
32	704	My only dislikes are how gassy this pill makes me and how much hungrier I am, however I'll take those things over nausea and occasional actual illness.
32	705	I was on sprintec for over 2 years with no complications then all of a sudden I started to get horrible abdominal pain and nausea ( I seriously thought I was dying) and no one could figure out why!!!!
32	706	The first few months I experienced the normal side effects - nausea in the morning, dizziness, feeling a bit out of it mentally.
32	707	I haven't had any nausea or huge side effects.
32	708	Side effects would include sore breasts and nausea if I had to start over because I forgot.
32	709	Other side effects I've experienced is weight loss, loss of appetite, and manageable nausea that has recently gotten better, but still occurs on a daily basis.
32	710	I also experienced the worst nausea and it even caused me to throw up one night.
32	711	I experienced extreme nausea initially, until I learned it's best to take the medication at night.
32	712	When first beginning this medication,  I experienced nausea, the first month only.
32	713	Mine include: nausea, increase appetite, and definite mood swings.
32	714	Didn't have any problems until lately, mainly just nausea and sore breasts.
32	715	Everything was fine aside from the general nausea that went away after a few weeks.
32	716	I would wake up with terrible nausea almost every single morning (except when I was on the sugar pills).
32	717	The nausea was what really made me hate this pill.
32	718	No side effects, no nausea :)
32	719	Also, since I started on Sprintec, I've been feeling a bit of nausea.
32	720	I take the pill at 10 pm every night and it seems like the nausea gets worse right before I take it.
32	721	The nausea was so bad today that I thought it had to be morning sickness.
32	722	The first day I started this birth control I did expedience nausea, but I haven't had it sense.
32	723	I've only been on this for about a month and a half and the first month wasn't bad at all, my period was light and the only side effect was mild nausea.
32	724	Cons: nausea.
32	725	I have been experiencing severe nausea, as well as loss of appetite and fatigue.
32	726	I learned early on to take BC medication before bed to ease the nausea, but this really hasn't helped with the Sprintec.
32	727	It gradually decreased and I currently experience no nausea at all in my 3rd month.
32	728	I have experienced a lil nausea after taking my pills if I hadn't eaten yet.
32	729	Diarrhea, nausea (without vomiting).
32	730	Rather than the nausea feeling, it seems to be an okay birth control, so far I'm not pregnant.
32	731	Otherwise, periods were good and 3 days long, no nausea after the first day of taking it
32	732	I get lightheaded and dizzy, nausea, my mood swings are crazy.
32	733	The main side effect on day one was nausea, I was so sick I slept by the trash can that night.
32	734	The nausea has gone away for the most part but that may be due to lack of eating.
32	735	I take it at 8:30 every night, but I usually don't fall asleep until 11 and I haven't felt any nausea or sickness!
32	736	The nausea is bad though (to me), I actually feel sick at this moment and I know it%u2019s from the pill I had to take this morning.
32	737	The nausea is a bit annoying.
32	738	Firstly, I get nausea when I start a new pack.
32	739	The only con I can Think of is slight nausea after Taking The pill but it doesn't last very long and I Take my pill at bedtime so I'm sleep when The nausea occurs anyway.
32	740	I only had symptoms the first 2 days and that was only nausea and one time vomiting.
32	741	After the first few days on the pill the nausea was gone.
32	742	Horrible mood swings, and nausea.
32	743	I had very little nausea for a couple of weeks.
32	744	She also recommended taking it at night, (to help with nausea) and it worked.
32	745	No nausea, no moodiness.
32	746	I do experience occasional dizziness and nausea, but they usually pass after 10 minutes or so.
32	747	This birth control gave me chronic yeast infections, uncomfortable vagina, mood swings, nausea.
32	748	Since the third month I haven't had any side effects other than nausea.
32	749	After the nausea ended I felt amazing for a whole week, then it got really bad.
32	750	The nausea went away within a few weeks.
32	751	I have been on Sprintec for 1 week and the nausea is there all the time.
32	752	Immediately after I took the first pill I was nauseated, it didn't matter if it was taken with food at all.
32	753	The only side effects I had is the month after I stop taking the pill I became very bloated, nauseated, vomiting, and lower abdomen pain as if I was at least 3 months pregnant.
32	754	I stopped taking it two nights ago, because had loss of appetite, I was getting mad at everything, I'm constantly nauseated and throwing up all hours of the night.
32	755	The only bad thing is the nauseated feelings everyday and loss of appetite but the weight loss is pretty good :)
32	756	1st month I was on the pill I was extremely nauseated without vomiting during the day.
32	757	Every time I start a new pack (after period) I get severely nauseated for several days, so I am finally going to go back to the doctor and try something different.
32	758	I haven't had a decent nights sleep in almost a month, I am horribly depressed, I cry several times a day, and nauseated whenever I don't eat right away.
32	759	I have been constantly nauseated, can barely eat and have begun to break out like crazy.
32	760	For about a week now every time my little girl will wake up to eat around 2 I will be so nauseated and I can't go back to sleep.
32	761	I’m nauseous if I don’t eat with it.
32	762	Suddenly I was vomiting multiple times a day and nauseous all the time.
32	763	It's also made me nauseous most days.
32	764	Pros: not pregnant, cleared my skin up, first pill to not make me nauseous.
32	765	At first it was rough, I felt very nauseous all the time, I actually missed school one day but around the 3rd month it's been pretty good.
32	766	But the cons is I feel super nauseous right after I take it for a couple hours to the verge where I wanna puke and the last eight months it's made me gain  10 pounds.
32	767	I have been on this pill for 3 weeks now and I have felt nauseous every day.
32	768	I have been on this pill for about a year now and in the beginning it made me super nauseous for the first week and then the first few months I was constantly hungry 24/7.
32	769	I have never in my life been so continuously nauseous.
32	770	This medication does however make you more prone to being nauseous.
32	771	I feel nauseous everyday, I don't ever want to eat, my doctor told me to take it with protein but every time I eat I feel even worse.
32	772	I was nauseous and broke out for the first week.
32	773	I've been on it for almost 3 years now and at first it would barely make me nauseous every once in a while but now I've just been on it too long I guess.
32	774	I just recently started on sprintec and I've been nauseous and feeling like I'm gaining weight and have an itchy crotch
32	775	If I don't take the pill around the same time every day, and/or I take it on an empty stomach, this stuff makes me nauseous.
32	776	BUT I've recently been feeling nauseous on and off during the day along with diarrhea.
32	777	I notice I do get nauseous sometimes but rarely.
32	778	This is the first birth control I've ever taken so my body was not used to the hormones and had to re-adjust (I'm guessing), I would have major mood swings, cry for everything and get really nauseous.
32	779	Sometimes I feel a little nauseous, and my appetite has gone down.
32	780	I still feel nauseous the next day well into 4 or 5pm.
32	781	This pill did not work for me, the first day I took it I felt sick and nauseous.
32	782	The first day I took it, I felt nauseous but I expected it because I did my research.
32	783	The entire first week I was nauseous for hours starting about four hours after I took it.
32	784	I have to take this pill at night or I'll be nauseous the whole time I%u2019m at work.
32	785	This is only my second week taking it  and I take it at night but right after I eat I get nauseous.
32	786	For you ladies who get nauseous after taking the pill, before I started my Dr. warned me about that and she recommended I take the pill before bed, so I take mine at 10 pm every night so even if I do get nauseous I don't feel it because I'm usually asleep.
32	787	After that, I never felt nauseous again.
32	788	I noticed the first packet I was nauseous.
32	789	BUT...about an hour or so after I take my pill I get extremely nauseous.
32	790	I did have a very suppressed appetite at first, I was very hungry but would sit down to eat and just be nauseous at the thought.
32	791	Otherwise I like it a lot.I'm just glad I'm not feeling nauseous like a lot of girls had on here.
32	792	I was also nauseous for the first week of every month, for about four months.
32	793	My breasts have SIGNIFICANTLY grown, I experience a lot more emotion (I cry so much), some days I have an appetite while some days I do not, and some days I am extremely nauseous.
32	794	This past month, I also began feeling nauseous, faint, constipated, exhausted-yet can't sleep, and just started experiencing some blood in my discharge.
32	795	I've noticed I feel nauseous a lot.
32	796	I started Sprintec and about a day later I began to feel nauseous.
32	797	I get nauseous in the middle of the night if I don't take it on time, but it hasn't happened lately.
32	798	The side effect sheet it came with said to expect feeling nauseous for the first three months and it should go away completely after that.
32	799	The only big issue I have with it is if I take it without eating I get extremely nauseous for a few hours.
32	800	I've been on this for a week and it's caused me to be more moody and nauseous pretty bad the first few days.
32	801	The first few weeks of taking Sprintec was rough, I felt nauseous all of the time.
32	802	The only times I felt nauseous was if I didn't eat a meal at all before or after taking the pill.
32	803	The first month I would get nauseous and dizzy randomly.
32	804	I haven't had any side effects but being nauseous on the first and I'm losing weight, sometimes I feel myself being a little nauseous at times but nothing major and periods are regular as normal.
32	805	The first week I only noticed that I felt nauseous and after that my body got used to it.
32	806	Lastly I've only thrown up like 3 times in my life but as soon as I started taking this I've been super nauseous every day and every other night or so I wake up and have to throw up.
32	807	I was feeling faint & dizzy and definitely not in the mood for anything.
32	808	I get light headed and dizzy to a point where I want to throw up or feel like passing out.
32	809	I also feel dizzy and out of it.
32	810	The first month I was dizzy and my skin was really oily, but taking it before bed and washing my face more often helped.
32	811	I still get dizzy randomly and an upset stomach out of nowhere.
32	812	I've only been on this birth control for a few weeks and I am experiencing crazy anxiety and EXTREME dizziness!!
32	813	After the 2nd month the dizziness completely disappeared and my skin looks great.
32	814	I was on it for more than 3 yrs, and then I started experiencing mood swings, and dizziness.
32	815	Although, the only bad thing about these pills is that it gives me major mood swings.
32	816	Anyway, my weight increased too and have had really bad mood swings.
32	817	Terrible mood swings and depression and paranoia/anxiety.
32	818	I had some pretty serious mood swings with that birth control, and thankfully did not experience that with sprintec.
32	819	My mood swings were out of control and I completely lost my appetite so I lost weight.
32	820	Horrible mood swings since starting the pill.
32	821	The change in hormones throughout the month than dropping off to have my period has given me crazy mood swings.
32	822	If you struggle with mood swings especially while on birth control pills I would NOT recommend
32	823	I had terrible mood swings, anxiety and depression.
32	824	At the very beginning, I did experience horrible mood swings though, it took some months to get used to.
32	825	I also had very bad mood swings and became very emotional.
32	826	I don't have any mood swings that I've experienced with other birth control.
32	827	I no longer had the mood swings, or the depression, nor did I bloat as bad as I did prior to BC.
32	828	Also, mood swings have become way too frequent.
32	829	(See previous review) The worst symptoms were: I began to feel  delusional and crazy to the point where I thought about going to the hospital because of the severe mood swings and loss of reality.
32	830	Felt depressed, mood swings, anxiety, rapid heart beat, and felt out of breath.
32	831	The first week of taking the pills, I experienced some minor mood swings & bloating but that was about it.
32	832	I read a ton of reviews that warned of major mood swings and irritability, but I never experienced that.
32	833	I experienced a LOT of breakthrough bleeding in the beginning.I also experienced mood swings.
32	834	I was on ortho tri cyclen lo prior and my mood swings and emotions were out of control.
32	835	My skin is actually very clear and the most important, no mood swings or depreassion if anything this pill keeps me very calm.
32	836	However I used to drink a lot of caffeine but I notice that after taking this pill whenever I drink coffee I get very anxious and get mood swings so I decided to cut on the coffeine but I still feel great.
32	837	I've never gotten bad mood swings before, but I have been lately.
32	838	When I missed a pill or two I do feel more emotionally unstable and have mood swings.
32	839	I was having bad mood swings and missing periods so I was put on the pill.
32	840	And I haven't developed any mood swings or depression.
32	841	And I got mood swings and depression to the point of suicidal thoughts!
32	842	During the first month I experienced mood swings and irritability, but by the 3rd month I was fine.
32	843	I did get some mood swings, I didn't gain weight but I always felt hungry, I would eat and then five minutes later feel like I'm starving.
32	844	As soon as a started my first pack of Sprintec, I immediately was having severe depression and mood swings.
32	845	I felt like I was going crazy, depressed, had crazy mood swings, sensitive over everything and just emotional or pissed off all the time.
32	846	Severe crying spells and extreme sensitivity to anything someone said to me and also mood swings with depression and anxiety.
32	847	I was extremely emotional with bloating and mood swings.
32	848	Mood swings and depression.
32	849	The mood swings are ridiculous too!
32	850	It caused me severe depression, anxiety, bloating, and mood swings.
32	851	My moods have been great and no PMS mood swings.
32	852	But they are super effective and I rarely get mood swings.
32	853	It has helped with my mood swings and has cleared my skin dramatically.
32	854	The side effects seem to run the gamut from "it gave me terrific mood swings!"
32	855	I had missed periods, very late periods, mild mood swings (nothing major) though.
32	856	I took Loestrin first and hated it, bad mood swings and increased appetite so I immediately switched to Sprintec and was completely happy.
32	857	The side effects I had were breast being sore, increase in appetite, and very bad mood swings.
32	858	Everything else is good, the Acne and the weight and stuff are normal for me but the mood swings are killer.
32	859	They made me have severe mood swings and horrible depression, so my doctor put me on this one.
32	860	The first 3 weeks I was taking it, I had pretty bad mood swings, but this is expected, and they quit happening around the time I started my second cycle of pills.
32	861	However, my mood swings are back in check.
32	862	The plus side for me on this pill is my mood swings are gone.
32	863	I have noticed some mood swings around my period but nothing unmanageable.
32	864	The one bad thing I have to say about this pill is the mood swings, good lord are they bad.
32	865	It was okay at first then I realized I was having mood swings.
32	866	Around the third month of taking Sprintec I started noticing my mood swings were out of control.
32	867	I have had crazy mood swings, very little energy, despite my best efforts, unable to loose weight (it just keeps packing on and I use to not be able to gain weight even if I tried).
32	868	The mood swings are now ridiculous along with being emotional.
32	869	After it finally ended I have noticed major mood swings and lots of anxiety.
32	870	I have my mood swings like any girl, my sex-drive has increased greatly, so far has prevented pregnancy, and has cleared up my skin SO much!
32	871	This was worse than my mood swings on Seasonique, and in one month I almost broke up with my boyfriend for literally no reason, twice.
32	872	The worst part about it was my mood swings, they were horrible.
32	873	My breasts have gotten larger and I have a few mood swings, mostly around the time of my period.
32	874	I do have a lot of mood swings but that might also have something to do with me being 15 other than that I haven't had any side effects and it has worked great.
32	875	I switched off of YAZ which gave me intense mood swings, other than that I had no issues with YAZ, but it was expensive as well.
32	876	The first week and a half I started taking it, I had the worst mood swings (Crying profusely, suicidal thoughts, depression), but that was it really.
32	877	The worst side effect of all is my mood swings.
32	878	I got perscribed this for mood swings during that time of the month rather than for birth control.
32	879	As far as my mood swings, it works pretty well but every now and then I get really depressed and that's not normal for me.
32	880	Mood swings are out of control.
32	881	My boyfriend commented on my mood changes and obvious depression and lack of enthusiasm for activities I use to enjoy.
32	882	Mood Changes, I do tend to get mad easily now and cry a lot more than I used too.
32	883	My periods are light and on time exactly every 28 days, lasting 3 or four days, tops, my skin is flawless, and although I do have some light mood changes accompanying PMS (which is something over the Depo, which seemed to completely rob me of all emotion), it's so inexpensive, I would and often do highly recommend it.
32	884	My mood changed drastically and this past weekend found myself very depressed and having severe anxiety!!
32	885	After reading some of the reviews I was a bit nervous trying this new method.
32	886	im 21 and this is my very first time being on any kind of BC, so I was extremly nervous.
32	887	I was nervous to start taking birth control after reading up on all of the side effects and being the worrier that I am.
32	888	I was nervous because of the side effects from my previous birth control pill but have to say I'm in love!
32	889	I am an anxious person but this was next level.
32	890	I also have felt more tired and incredibly anxious which was unusual.
32	891	I get depressed and very anxious!
32	892	Could not for the life of me figure out why I was so anxious to the point of not sleeping, and crying all the time.
32	893	When I stop taking it for the week I have my period I feel anxious, depressed, moody and emotional.
32	894	I'm so depressed and anxious on this pill.
32	895	I have the most regular periods, clear skin, don't get anxious that I might be pregnant, and haven't ever had any anxiety or depression (except for the first two months I was on it) I would say that since I started taking this birth control I do have a weak stomach and almost anything can make me throw up.
32	896	I have had heightened anxiety and depression in the last 8 months.
32	897	I've came go realize recently that this birth control has caused my depression, anxiety and my inablitiy to sleep well.
32	898	Look for the side effects of depression, anxiety and lack of sleep within the first three/four months because that's when it starts and that's when you should get off of it.
32	899	I'm obviously not, but the pill defiantly causes a lot of my anxiety  and I'm almost on it for a year and my period is still always changing and I still have side effects.
32	900	The first 2 months I experienced extreme loss of appetite, depression, suicidal thoughts, panic, anxiety and insomnia.
32	901	My anxiety is so bad it's tearing apart my relationship.
32	902	Other side effects I have had are terrible anxiety and depression.
32	903	Ever since I started it I have been having extreme anxiety, depression, OCD and loss of appetite.
32	904	Subsided and all was good- until the anxiety and depression hit me like a truck.
32	905	I feel so depressed all of the time and my anxiety is through the roof.
32	906	My skin is absolutely perfect, but it has made me extremely emotional to the point where I can cry just thinking about something sad (something that would never happen to me before taking these pills) and my anxiety is just constantly on.
32	907	My anxiety is terrible.
32	908	I also started to gain more weight, feel depressed, and had very bad anxiety.
32	909	Right before i started taking the 'sugar pill' or the last week of pills for the month, i ended up getting SUPER sick sypmtoms including: anxiety, loss of sleep, severe depression and fatal thoughts, very light headed almost passing out, nausea/vommiting just to name a few.
32	910	I suffer from severe depression and anxiety, this actually curbed it for me.
32	911	Worst anxiety attacks..
32	912	Severe anxiety, constant bloating and constipation, hemorrhoids, insomnia, etc.
32	913	The anxiety was better because I was hyped on sedatives but my digestive system was a wreck.
32	914	I've had major depression and anxiety and awful pms.
32	915	The most concerning part to me is that I began having extreme anxiety and have now been diagnosed with OCD.
32	916	I was switched to it because my other birth control caused me to have anxiety attacks because of the hormones.
32	917	Personally I have not experienced major anxiety or depression.
32	918	I've been losing sleep every night from feeling so sick in my stomach, I feel really depressed and my anxiety is through the roof!
32	919	Severe anxiety, horrible depression and loss of appetite.
32	920	My doctor had to prescribe anxiety medicine to help me get through the work week.
32	921	Additionally, I started to have anxiety attacks about three times a week and had extreme depression with suicidal thoughts.
32	922	I have struggled with anxiety, and severe depression in the past, and this is definitely a mood stabilizer for me.
32	923	I rarely have to deal with anxiety anymore or depression.
32	924	Having terrible breast pain  all day long.
32	925	The only side effects that really bother me are the occasional extreme breast tenderness and the acid reflux.
32	926	The only other side effect besides depression was breast tenderness.
32	927	Also had breast tenderness and bloating.
32	928	I've been sticking it out, because I've read everywhere that it usually subsides within three months, but I've been on the pill for almost five months and my breast tenderness and swelling has not subsided.
32	929	No side effects except breast tenderness first month but went away.
32	930	Extreme breast tenderness and swelling.
32	931	I also experienced breast tenderness and sensitivity which is not welcome since I sleep on my stomach.
32	932	The same issue everyone is having: breast tenderness.
32	933	I have also noticed breast tenderness most days and they seem to be growing a little.
32	934	The only thing is that I'll sometimes have to deal with minor side effects, including breast tenderness, but this is rare and never happens two months in a row.
32	935	Tender breasts (which is not a big complaint), and also depression-like symptoms.
32	936	During certain times I have very swollen and tender breasts, but that's not too awful to bear.
32	937	I get bloated and tender breasts now.
32	938	Recently I went to the doctor for a check up, and she suggested a new birth control pill that will aloud me to only have 2 day periods verses the 4 day ones I have with Sprintec, but also, I wouldn't get the sore breasts, etc., plus it is a lower dose.
32	939	I also notice that it made my breasts hurt tremendously during the first few weeks .
32	940	It also gave me a horrible yeast infection.
32	941	I got a yeast infection from it, which was hell.
32	942	I rate this birth control a 5 because even though it has helped preventing pregnancy and regulating my period, every month I would get a yeast infection.
32	943	The yeast infection got so bad that my doctor had to prescribe medication for it to go away Monistat as a treatment was out of the question.
32	944	This pill basically gave me a constant yeast infection.
32	945	However, I have noticed that the first few days of a new pack, I get vaginal itchiness and I worry that I'm going to get a yeast infection.
32	946	I did just get a yeast infection, like many other users commented.
32	947	I was excited to be paying significantly less but I have been experiencing about 1 yeast infection each month.
32	948	I have also experienced heavy discharge (non yeast infection) and tiredness.
32	949	If I get an yeast infection this month I will not continue another month that's for sure.
32	950	Haven't had a yeast infection.
32	951	I also got a yeast infection last month and while oral contraceptives give you a higher risk of contracting a yeast infection, so do antibiotics.
32	952	I did get one yeast infection, which I have never had before, about 2 weeks after starting the pill but besides that everything is working very well with this pill!
32	953	I have been on Sprintec for about 4 months now..the first month exactly a week before my period I caught a yeast infection, which I had never had before.
32	954	Every month after that I had a yeast infection exactly one week before my period.
32	955	Sprintec also gives me a yeast infection every month.
32	956	I haven't had a yeast infection in over ten years so I know it was the Sprintec because I got the infection after first 2 weeks of using it.
32	957	I also have yeast infections right before my period for the past 2 months which I never had before in my life.
32	958	Ever since I got on in I have had multiple yeast infections, and urinary tract infections.
32	959	Did have a lot of yeast infections every month on the time of my period.
32	960	I got constant yeast infections.
32	961	Fourth month was awesome but the past two months I've been getting yeast infections.
32	962	I didn't gain weight, get bigger breasts, nor have yeast infections or urinary tract infections.
32	963	I am prone to yeast infections but haven't gotten one so far.
32	964	This medicine just gave me constant yeast infections.
32	965	My HUGE complaint is that Sprintec gave me yeast infections almost every month.
33	1	No one in my family has a history of cystic acne and when I started taking this I got cystic acne REALLY bad!
33	2	I went to the dermatologist and tried many meds to get rid of the acne but it was from this life ruining birth control!
33	3	I was so depressed and self conscious because of the acne this caused!
33	4	I've been on two other generics w/o any side effects, cystic acne just isn't worth it.
33	5	I've been getting bad acne (I've never had acne in my life, maybe a spot a month).
33	6	My acne hasn't gotten worse.
33	7	After about one month of being on it, I developed TERRIBLE acne!!!
33	8	The first month I was taking orsythia and it made my acne disappear within two weeks and I absolutely loved it.
33	9	I'm about three weeks into syronx and my acne has worsened..
33	10	My acne has gotten three times worse.
33	11	My acne was the worst it has ever been.
33	12	I got acne here and there, mostly around the time of my period.
33	13	This was something else, they were inflamed, painful hormonal acne all on my jawline and neck.
33	14	My acne level has stayed the same.
33	15	I have had the most irregular periods for years as well as horrible acne.
33	16	My acne has gotten much better and my boyfriend has said sex feels better (I agree) I should be getting my first period since starting the pill this week!
33	17	Since starting Sronyx, I've noticed my acne has gotten worse, but I've had an increased sex drive, lost weight, and my periods are very light and short!
33	18	I haven't had any breast growth or pain, but my acne is horrible.
33	19	I never had any moodiness, acne, weight gain or any side effects from it.
33	20	Pros: increase sex drive, little acne, not pregnant cons: slightly moody, period twice a month, bad cramping
33	21	It cleared up my acne and the appetite increase is manageable.
33	22	I've been on Sronyx for 4 weeks now and so far things I've noticed has been increased acne breakouts (not horribly), really bad bloating around my period, and some weight gain (luckily only 3 lbs).
33	23	It has made me gain over 40 pounds and increased my acne when I am on placebo pills.
33	24	My acne is a lot better than before I took the pills too!
33	25	But my periods are on the exact day everyone month, and my acne is gone except for the week of my period.
33	26	But unfortunately my acne gets too bad the week I take the inactive pills, so I am looking into different birthcontrols.
33	27	I had no symptoms, and it cleared up my mild acne.
33	28	All my acne is gone and my skin glows!
33	29	I've always had bad skin, but after 4 months on this pill I had painful cystic acne all over my jawline.
33	30	It didn't even look like acne; but I looked it up online and it was in fact hormonal acne brought on by birth control.
33	31	Initially I was taking Microgestin but it was making me extremely moody and gave me acne.
33	32	So far I have been spotting every single day and have been breaking out with pimples on my face.
33	33	My only side effect is me breaking out, if it weren't for that I would be giving it a 10!
33	34	I am starting to have pimples on my face that I never had in my 22 years of life.
33	35	First of all I had clear skin before I started taking this birth control pill, right after I began to take the pills my forehead started to breakout in pimples.
33	36	I had a couple of zits pop up around my period when I was off of the active pills.
33	37	Don't let the fear of a couple of zits or a few hormonal days keep you from trying it.
33	38	After that I started getting bad headaches 3-4 times a week, I was moody and snappy half the month from PMS time to the end of my period, I got my period before I made it to the placebo pills, got horrible cramps which I never get, crying spells, nausea after eating and breakouts.
33	39	My period came twice a month and the cramps were awful.
33	40	I was a cramp sufferer during my period since I started for the first time at the age of 13 (I am now 28), to the point where there was a few times I was almost rushed to the ER for them and I haven't had any cramps whatsoever ever since being on this.
33	41	I had previously been on Jolessa which I loved, but wanted a monthly period due to the bad cramps when I finally got my period after 3 months.
33	42	No bad side effects and did the job had hardly any cramps and no heavy bleeding.
33	43	Then on my first cycled period it gave me clotting and cramps that made me not even wanna move.
33	44	At first i got some cramps with my period which i had never gotten before but after a month of being on it that has gone away.
33	45	My cramps and periods length have lessened.
33	46	When I would get my period I had really bad cramps and it was heavy.
33	47	I would get heavy periods throughout the entire month, bad cramps, weight gain like crazy, and it's making my hair fall out.
33	48	For me, it does an extremely good job with controlling my heavy periods, decreased cramps, bloating, fatique...etc etc.
33	49	Last night I woke up with really bad cramps and to a really heavy period.
33	50	I have had no mood swings, no cramps during period, no heavy periods, no problems with weight/acne, and no changes in sex drive.
33	51	No bloating or weight gain, no breakouts, no mood swings, no period cramps at all (I previously had debilitating ones for several days out of the month), I know exactly when my period will start and end (used to be irregular), and best of all, no pregnancy!
33	52	In high school, before I was on the pill, I never got cramps, or had bad mood swings but now I'm constantly doubled over from cramping, I get irritable, and I NEVER know when my period will actually start.
33	53	I also have cramps every time I get up suddenly , which although they are way less painful than the Nuvaring ones they are constant.
33	54	I am currently having abdominal cramps and white discharge, I have lighter and lighter periods.
33	55	I've gained almost 4lbs in the first month and its given me such painful cramps.
33	56	While I'm on Sronyx my periods are very light without cramps or pain.
33	57	The first time I started using birth control I started on a different pill which I can't remember the name but stopped after the second month due to crazy mood swings and worse cramps during my period.
33	58	No headaches, cramps, or mood swings.
33	59	I started using the pill for the first time 3 months ago due to TERRIBLE cramps, periods every 3 weeks lasting 7 days, extreme mood swings, and just overall miserable, painful periods.
33	60	My cramps were much more bearable and the bleeding was less.
33	61	After I started Sronyx my period is light and I don't cramp as bad as I used to.
33	62	I have been taking Syronx to calm my cramping and bleeding on my period and I have not been pleased.
33	63	My doctor prescribed this Birth Control to me to help resolve the intense cramping and heavy bleeding I have on my period.
33	64	But it causes severe cramping.
33	65	Which has never happened before my periods before birth control were very light and no cramping.
33	66	However, with Sronyx, I noticed I was a lot moodier, crying a lot, spotting a few days before I was even on the placebo pills.
33	67	Even from the very beginning I have not experienced any negative side effects with one exception (spotting in between periods has happened three times before, but nothing major).
33	68	I give it a nine out of ten only because of the occasional spotting in between periods.
33	69	The first month I did experience breast pain, one week of irritability and just a couple days of spotting.
33	70	I started taking the pill when I was 14 & I only gained 5 pounds & I spotted for a few days.
33	71	This one only gave me a slight headache around the last couple days of the inactive pills and the first couple of days starting a new month, but nothing too terrible.
33	72	I have been on these pills since May 2017 and I haven't had side effects but I would tell you to take them on time every day because you will have break through bleeding and it can last from a few days to a few weeks but one this that I can say it that I have lost weight and I don't have crazy cravings, no tender breast, and no headaches ... this has been my first time on BC and I have had a great experience!!!!
33	73	I have already started vomiting, getting headaches and nausea and like I said, it's only been a couple of days.
33	74	I've gotten extreme nausea, crazy discharge, constipation, sore breasts and daily headaches.
33	75	Did have slight headaches in the first week of use but it's gone now and NO BABIES.. (don't drink or smoke).
33	76	I had small headaches, but those didn't bother me.
33	77	I never had headaches until I started taking this pill.
33	78	I would also get terrible headaches the day my period started.
33	79	I get headaches very easily after I started to take this pills.
33	80	When I started on Sronyx I had nausea with mild headaches for the first couple of days.
33	81	Also been getting random painful headaches.
33	82	I have had light headaches on and off, and also a change in my appetite.
33	83	I have only been using this for a little while and I constantly have bad headaches and drowsiness.
33	84	I took this as an alternative to most birth controls, which were giving me migraines.
33	85	The only benefits are weight loss and increased sex drive, which my boyfriend loves.
33	86	Gained weight and it absolutely killed my sex drive.
33	87	My sex drive stayed pretty stable and haven't noticed any changes in weight (although I do believe my appetite has increased).
33	88	Since starting Sronyx 3 weeks ago I have been so happy and my sex drive is way higher.
33	89	However, the side effects I have gotten are decreased sex drive and mood swings.
33	90	Not to mention a severely decreased sex drive.
33	91	Doesn't affect my mood but does affect my sex drive a little.
33	92	I also experience extreme mood swings which I'm sure are because of the pill ( my boyfriend noticed too)  My sex drive is almost non existent on top of severe vaginal dryness.
33	93	I am almost done my second month however, and I have started to notice that my sex drive has seemed to decrease and it has made me constantly dry during intercourse.
33	94	My sex drive is back.
33	95	Weight gain, tender breast especially the nipples and horrible back pain.
33	96	No sign in weight gain.
33	97	I noticed a crazy weight gain, my appetite has doubled and my mood change constantly.
33	98	I'm wondering if weight gain is just an initial side effect of Sronyx and that I'll eventually go back to my normal weight?
33	99	Hello weight gain!
33	100	I have been taking the BC Sronyx for about 2 months, my period have not came on (which is AWESOME), THE DOWNFALL, my hair has started to fall out and become thin, I am very moody (angry), I have gained 10 lbs within the 2 month timeframe.
33	101	I haven't gained weight.
33	102	Before taking sronyx I used to take loestrin 24 fe and I had no problems with that I enjoyed it ..my doctor prescribed me sronyx recently and as soon as I took this bc I gained about 5 lbs the first month even though I exercise for almost 2 hours 4-5 times a week and my appetite has increased ...I have never felt so hungry to the point where i feel like I'm going to snap!
33	103	I've gained a couple pounds but well..
33	104	The only downfall is I gained 10 pounds which is very abnormal for me since I am very active.
33	105	I am a bit more moody, and my appetite has increased a little with this pill (I've gained 10 pounds, but managed to lose 5).
33	106	I have gained 10 pounds.
33	107	I was able to lose the weight that I had gained with Ortho Tri Cyclen, and I haven't been craving food all the time.
33	108	Have not changed my diet or exercise, and have gained about 8 lbs.
33	109	I was on the patch a year ago but everytime i put the patch on after my period i got severe nausea that left me in bed ALL day.
33	110	I wake up in the middle of the night with nausea and vomiting, breast tenderness that hurts soooooo bad and also it raised my blood pressure.
33	111	I take my pill around 8:30 every night and since I have been taking it I have woken up each night with nausea, dizziness, and bloating.
33	112	I'm 21 and ever since my period (before birth control) I've had bad crapping, vomiting sometimes, and nausea.
33	113	I threw up after the 5 hours of nausea and finally felt a little better.
33	114	I only had breakthrough bleeding the first month, and I never experienced nausea.
33	115	Unlike other birth controls I had no nausea.
33	116	I had swollen breasts, mood swings, severe nausea.
33	117	So far I have experienced some side effects such as mild nausea the first few days I was on it but not enough to bother me.
33	118	My anxiety sky rocketed and if anything, I've lost weight due to not being hungry and feeling nauseous when I do eat.
33	119	Since taking this I have been bleeding, my boobs hurt so bad even wearing a bra hurts, and I'm so nauseous I feel like I'm constantly running to the bathroom.
33	120	My breasts got slightly bigger and ached for about a month and a half, I did have breakthrough bleeding the first month I was on the pill, and the two times I've missed a pill and had to take 2 in one day it did make me nauseous, but all those things are completely to be expected.
33	121	I woke up feeling down and took the next pill, about three hours later I was nauseous and sick to my stomach.
33	122	It makes me feel dizzy, I just didn't feel like myself at all.
33	123	Finally a birth control that doesn't give me horrible side affects like mood swings and heavy periods.
33	124	My boobs felt tender and gave me the worst mood swings.
33	125	And mood swings.
33	126	Only downfall I find with this prescription is the mood swings.
33	127	My mood swings are insane.
33	128	Also my mood swings have been all over the place.
33	129	I have no other side effects or mood swings which I love and it actually helps me control my hunger I don't feel as hungry as I did before which has helped me lose about 8 lbs!
33	130	My skin is clear, I have NO mood swings, and I'm actually losing weight.
33	131	I'm happy again without any mood swings.
33	132	I noticed from the beginning my mood changed.
33	133	I was nervous about being put on this birth control because of all the negative reviews I read about it.
33	134	I am very nervous about this as well.
33	135	Also I have gotten so moody, irritable, grumpy, anxious, and depressed (again I don't know if I can say the pill caused this but it slowly crept up on me and I can't figure out another reason for it).
33	136	I started to have the worse anxiety ever.
33	137	I was having anxiety attacks at night, insomnia, crying for NO reason, loss motivation.
33	138	I've never had issues with anxiety or depression before taking this.
33	139	About 7 months into taking the pill my anxiety sky rocketed and I became increasingly depressed.
33	140	I've had anxiety & literally feel like another person.
33	141	I did notice some months I got pretty bad breast tenderness during my period, but it wasn't every single month.
33	142	Went from a C cup to a double D. Sounds lovely but my breasts hurt most days out of the week.
34	1	The only good thing was that I had absolutely no acne!
34	2	Up until last month, I'd had no negative side-effects; no migraines  (which are normal for me), no depression, regular anxiety, cleared my hormonal acne, regular if not strengthened sex drive, fairly regular periods.
34	3	No nausea, no weight gain, there wasn't really a change in the amount of acne I had.
34	4	The biggest thing for me, it cleared up my awful hormonal acne.
34	5	The 4th day of taking it, it started to hurt when I  swallowed so I got kinda worried, I've been getting acne pretty bad and I've been getting really sick to my stomach and headaches and fevers and so my stepmom believes I'm coming down with thrust, I looked up things that can cause thrush & turns out birth control was on that list.
34	6	I originally got on this pill for mainly my acne and the pill made it worse.
34	7	I started to break out in acne on my face and body, and I was having a difficult time controlling my emotions and I became upset all the time.
34	8	I love this birth control it regulates my period I've never had a pregnancy scare (my boyfriend and I don't use condoms) or acne.
34	9	Sore breast, stomach cramps, bloating, and very bad acne.
34	10	But then I started getting large, vicious acne on my face which is super unusual for me!
34	11	I never had a problem with acne, not even in middle or high school.
34	12	So horrible that now that I'm in college and having to deal with near cystic acne.
34	13	Although it did help eliminate my acne, regulate my cycle, and prevent pregnancy, the cons outweigh the pros for me.
34	14	My acne is relatively clear and I no longer have cramping the day I start my period.
34	15	I started to have horrible cramps, nausea, loss of appetite,  diarrhea,  sore breasts,  acne, and a very bad anxiety problem.
34	16	When I first started the pill my acne had reached its worst.
34	17	Helped with my acne a lot and although my severe cramps are not completely diminished, Advil does the trick - definitely made a difference!
34	18	When I first began this pill I had no issues, it immediately regulated my period and decreased cramping and acne.
34	19	My acne has cleared a lot and it works definitely for birth control.
34	20	Doesn't help with acne, I've never had acne till I began taking this.
34	21	Starting the pill it cleared my acne up very well.
34	22	My acne got worse, but I haven't gained any weight.
34	23	My weight maintained stable, no acne, I haven't had any more mood swings than I would if I wasn't on it and obviously I haven't gotten pregnant after having unprotected sex.
34	24	My acne has cleared up significantly, which is nice!
34	25	It has lessened the acne I get before my period as well, but has not made it completely disappear.
34	26	No acne or mood swings.
34	27	My acne has cleared up a lot and my periods are lighter.
34	28	I started taking this BC last year 11/2014 when I got the Mirena taken out due to bad acne.
34	29	The only complaint I have about this birth control is bad tension headaches and fatigue, but I'll take that over weight gain and acne which fortunately this birth control doesn't cause at all!
34	30	I use it as a birth control, but it has helped a lot with my acne.
34	31	My acne is slowly going away, but I also use Proactiv.
34	32	I have been on this birth control for about 3 months no pregnancy scares and helps with my period a little bit but it usually makes me feel nauseous after I take it and I have been breaking out more
34	33	My face is breaking out along my chin nearly every day.
34	34	The first month I started taking the pill was crazy, my emotions were uncontrollable (it was scary) and my skin was breaking out.
34	35	I don't get pimples as much as I used to, and I'm more emotional.
34	36	I was told it would help reduce cramps and amount of blood during my period, but it actually did the exact opposite.
34	37	My period was much lighter with fewer cramps and my sex drive remained completely normal.
34	38	I get it the same day, same time, every month with no cramps.
34	39	No pregnancy scares, so side effects, regulated my period, and I had had intense cramps for the 4 years I was on my period before I started taking this.
34	40	And since I've taken this birth control I have had cramps probably twice.
34	41	I have horrible vaginal discharge almost everyday, I have cramps sometimes almost as bad as before I went on the pill.
34	42	Plus sides is I used to have cramps to where I would like cry.
34	43	I been on Tri-Previfem since 2014, Since my Insurance wouldn't cover Ortho Tricyclen, I like that it helped with my heavy periods and completely took away those bad cramps I would get every month.
34	44	Rarely any cramps too.
34	45	My period is light & I barely have cramps.
34	46	on the 2nd BC I was on for months, they are very predictable and my calendar is always accurate so I am well prepared, but I still get SEVERE cramps the first 2 days, which has always been a constant problem for me, on and off ALL the BC's I've been on.
34	47	Not to mention on a daily basis I had breast tenderness and cramps every week except the first week of the start of my pills.
34	48	Firstly, my periods are so much better, my cramps are non-existent, and my menstrual cycle is punctual.
34	49	It has lessened my cramps a LOT, made my breasts feel a bit bigger (according to my boyfriend).
34	50	Day 6,7, I got even more nauseous with cramping.
34	51	My cramping is getting worse with each period, I started spotting more monthly and during my period I get severe migranes.
34	52	Constant cramping out of nowhere, painful sex, zero sex drive, swollen, extremely tender breasts, mood swings, anger and aggression particularly,  some depression, constant fatigue, bloating, and an irregular period after years of it being regular.
34	53	I get little cramping but it's not that bad.
34	54	Compared to what I used to have, a 7 day period heavy flow and alot and I mean alot of cramping it's ten times better.
34	55	When I got my period the cramping became severe almost unbearable & my period last for 2 weeks.
34	56	4 day periods, sex drive is normal, minimal cramping, and no other side effects at all.
34	57	Occasionally I had spotting between periods, but it was never anything that disrupted me.
34	58	No decreased sex drive, spotting, emotional distress, etc.
34	59	Random spotting...which is extra annoying.
34	60	I've been spotting for about 2 days now, but I'm not supposed to starty period until next Friday.
34	61	My only complaint is that every once in a while I get some spotting for a few days.
34	62	The first month, I had some light spotting, which is expected when starting most pills.
34	63	However, I started getting headaches often, feeling weak, my face broke out, and I had spotting.
34	64	I didn't get pregnant and had a normal period but such severe stomach pains along with occasional headache I had to switch to a lower hormone so I'm using "Gildess" now I'm sad the only side effect I seemed to have was stomach pain.
34	65	I have severe headaches from the beginning of my period to the end.
34	66	However, around the time of my period I experienced extremely bad headaches (sometimes migraines accompained with vomiting) so my doctor just switched me over to a new pill recently.
34	67	Previously, I had random headaches but they were nothing excedrin couldn't handle.
34	68	I told myself to stick it through, it was the only thing helping the prevention of my headaches and migraines.
34	69	But a lot of little things like rapid heart rate, headaches, and frequent infections I finally linked to this.
34	70	I experienced hellish anxiety, fatigue, confusion, headaches and migraines, major depression and suicidal thoughts, and the list could go on forever.
34	71	Stopping the pill for a month to see if my headaches get better..
34	72	This is only my second month, but I'm done - severe migraine throughout my period, tension headaches the rest of the time, and terrible over-bleeding, a problem I've never had with any other birth control.
34	73	Then I got switched to Syeda, and the 2nd month I was on it I had headaches daily that would not go away with ibuprofen or Excedrin.
34	74	Then by the 3rd month I had headaches every other day.
34	75	The first few weeks I had severe headaches and since I started taking it, I have noticed weight gain, also my breasts have definitely become bigger and are always very sore.
34	76	I have noticed an increase in breast size, extra water weight, tenderness in breast along with nausea and headaches.
34	77	I found Tri-Previfem to be an effective contraceptive for my boyfriend and I; however, I have recently started getting sudden and severe headaches, and in some cases body aches.
34	78	It's really hard being a college student who needs to get work done when I get sudden severe headaches.
34	79	I've taken this pill for two weeks now and I've had a constant migraine.
34	80	My skin broke out, I gained 10lbs, my libido was non-existent, I sweat constantly and between migraines...which lasted for 2.5 out of 3 weeks I was on the pill...I had depression and breakthrough bleeding.
34	81	I've woken up with terrible migraines and being nauseous.
34	82	In May, I started having migraines.
34	83	After getting back on this bc, I had migraines the week of my cycle.
34	84	I had extreme migraines to the point where I had to go to the doctor and get a shot.
34	85	I originally started this medication due to chronic migraines caused by hormonal imbalance.
34	86	I have little to no sex drive as well as terrible migraines during the week before my period.
34	87	I have been prescribed 800mg ibuprofen for these migraines, as my gynecologist suggested it could be due to low estrogen levels and they don't even help.
34	88	I have chills where it feels like I have a fever - dizziness - severe migraines - neck pain - constant hunger - 10lb weight gain - confusion - nausea - ear aches - fatigue - stomach pain - anxiety - weakness - no sex drive.
34	89	I would get migraines here and there, too, ranging in severity.
34	90	If I still have migraines at the end of this pack, I may switch.
34	91	In very beginning, my sex drive peaked, but that quickly ended because it made sex very painful and it lacked any pleasure.
34	92	I have zero complaints other than it has completed depleted my sex drive to literally nothing, which is why I will be switching to another birth control
34	93	I'm surprised my boyfriend is still with me, because since this pill I have been depressed, unmotivated, moody, and have had no sex drive!
34	94	My sex drive if anything has increased while on this pill, and I have gained No weight!
34	95	Also, my sex drive has been wonderful!
34	96	Anxiety, depression, mood swings, NO SEX DRIVE, dryness "down there" no matter how bad I wanted to be.
34	97	I am anti social and I have no sex drive.
34	98	My breasts are constantly sore and I have absolutely no sex drive anymore.
34	99	I gained no weight from it, still had my sex drive, and it did a very good job of keeping me from getting pregnant.
34	100	I have no sex drive, and constant bleeding.
34	101	My sex drive is still the same, unless I'm the water pill week.
34	102	No change in sex drive and no crazy mood swings or depression.
34	103	and also I lost my sex drive completely.
34	104	My sex drive is also the same as before.
34	105	No sex drive at all.
34	106	I am currently taking the last of my second pack and I feel like my sex drive has been lost...
34	107	It makes my periods much lighter, and if anything it increased my sex drive.
34	108	One negative thing, I believe it has decreased my libido.
34	109	No libido either - my boyfriend hates it but the pill is the best way to avoid pregnancy.
34	110	I started feeling depressed, developing anxiety, and I noticed my libido was declining.
34	111	And don't even get me started on my libido.
34	112	As far as weight gain, this pill hadn't affected me that way.
34	113	I haven't had any crazy mood swings or bouts of depression, and my breasts have grown a whole cup size (again, without weight gain anywhere else!).
34	114	The only side effect I experienced was a little weight gain during the first few months.
34	115	My moods swings are bad and sometimes I'm depressed because of the weight gain.
34	116	Only reason I gave this pill a 9 was the weight gain!
34	117	No weight gain.
34	118	No weight gain and my skin still breaks out around my period.
34	119	Weight gain was an issue when I first started w/ Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo, but my weight has been pretty constant now.
34	120	I've now been on the pill for three months, I've experienced some weight gain but nothing drastic.
34	121	Very light three to four day periods, clear skin and no weight gain.
34	122	No pregnancy scare  ever ( I take it the same time every day) The only thing is I've gained about 10 pounds within this last year, but not sure if it's because of BC.
34	123	I had horrible mood swings, it affected my sleep, I gained weight, lost my appetite, and even lost the desire to have sex.
34	124	I've gained 10lbs.
34	125	So far I haven't gained any weight, it actually seems to curb my cravings which is great!
34	126	I've gained 10 lbs in just these three weeks.
34	127	When I first started taking it my breasts were sore and I gained a little weight for a very short time but it went away.
34	128	It has given me no negative side effects EXCEPT the fact that I gained 20 pounds.
34	129	I have gained several pounds over the last month and have not changed anything about my life style.
34	130	So far been on this for about 3 months now... And I've gained weight rapidly.
34	131	I only gained maybe 10lbs at most, but that's as well as growing up and fitting into my body.
34	132	My skin has cleared up and I haven't gained any weight (although I work out regularly and eat well).
34	133	I didn't like this birth control and I know it affects everyone differently, but this was my first time on the pill and within the first 3 months I gained 20 lbs!
34	134	No nausea , vomiting , diarrhea, or mood swings.
34	135	I ended up with severe depression and anxiety all over again, the nausea and vomiting was ridiculous and the yeast infections— my god.
34	136	Never any nausea.
34	137	It was ok for the first month of use but after that I found that this medication caused me to have heightened anxiety, loss of appetite, and even nausea.
34	138	Even more recently I've had nausea to the point where I'm throwing up periodically through the night.
34	139	More cons, more emotional, sometimes chest pain, nausea, I'm ready to quit.
34	140	I remained on the pill for about a year and a half before I started experiencing bad nausea everytime I missed a pill & also got really bad anxiety in the end.
34	141	Miss my boobs but not the nausea or anxiety
34	142	Month by month I stared noticing the nausea getting worse and worse.
34	143	I'm having terrible stomach pains, bloating, nausea, I'm constantly sad.
34	144	As well as being nausea and just not feeling well.
34	145	There was slight nausea and some change in irritability but I am overall happy with it.
34	146	On the second day of being on the pill I experienced constant nausea & stomach pain.
34	147	I've become severely depressed I cry all the time I feel nauseous 24/7.
34	148	The first week I'll have to admit it made me pretty nauseous, I actually lost a few pounds, but after that first week I've been fine.
34	149	I was nauseous after taking it on my second week so I discontinued it.
34	150	Day 3,4,5 I was dizzy and had spells of hunger and being nauseous, randomly cried (  at separate times) on top of being drowsy and overly tired.
34	151	Well, I see a lot of people saying they get nauseous in the first few days of starting birth control.
34	152	But every time I start a pack or miss by a few hours I'm awful nauseous.
34	153	I just lay in bed feeling hot, nauseous, and like I'm going to die.
34	154	I only took the first pill...ONE pill.... and the entirety of the next day I had chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, blurry vision and anxiety.
34	155	This medicine works great to prevent pregnancy, but I've had uncontrollable mood swing along with bad anxiety involving my relationship.
34	156	The mood swings were so sad also.
34	157	This pills has made me extremely depressed and has caused me to have mood swings.
34	158	My skin has never looked better, I didn't gain weight, nor did I experience mood swings.
34	159	My mood swings are ridiculous.
34	160	I am having constant serious mood swings.
34	161	My mood swings are way off the wall.
34	162	You definitely get pregnancy like symptoms...such has the bloating excessive eating, sensitive nose, mood swings and defintley lots of fluids real easing from you're body.
34	163	I lost my appetite, mood swings, and head aches.
34	164	I have had major mood swings while taking this pill.
34	165	The reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is because it has caused me some mood swings.
34	166	I have become overly anxious and paranoid.
34	167	For the past few months after my pharmacy switched me to Tri-Previfem, I have been so depressed and anxious, crying at random times whether I'm at work or home.
34	168	Also, my anxiety is worse than it's ever been and I really feel like dying.
34	169	My anxiety has gone through the roof.
34	170	I did have anxiety at times before the pill, but it was never this bad.
34	171	the past month or so however, I've had the most horrible anxiety, panic attacks, and irritability ever.
34	172	My anxiety was so bad I was having so many negative thoughts and didn't have the motivation to do much anymore.
34	173	After reading everyone's comments inhere I'm convinced that my high anxiety and depression is caused from this.
34	174	I had just gotten off of Orsythia and that gave me terrible deppression and anxiety throughout my menstrual cycle.
34	175	I've got bad anxiety now & cry a lot.
34	176	But my major issue is definitely the depression, anger, anxiety and crying spells it has caused.
34	177	I already have some anxiety but this birth control is making it to where I can't sleep and once I do sleep I can't stay asleep.
34	178	My anxiety is just getting so bad I will probably stop taking this medication.
34	179	My depression was really bad and my stomach hurt and I have severe panic and anxiety attacks.
34	180	I'm much more depressed, and I have developed a case of anxiety.
34	181	I have experienced several anxiety attacks after being switched to this pill.
34	182	As a nursing student life is stressful and lonely enough to deal with, this medicine has amplified my stress, anxiety, and depression.
34	183	I have been having anxiety attacks, which I never had before taking this.
34	184	I also had a lot of breast tenderness.
34	185	I had a yeast infection probably the whole time on this pill.
34	186	I have had a yeast infection every month since I've been on it.
34	187	(I've never had yeast infections before).
35	1	I do work out so I’m not sure about the weight gain but I haven’t had mood swings or crazy acne like other reviews say.
35	2	I also got HORRIBLE acne within the first 6 days.
35	3	I've never had cystic acne in my life and I now have huge cyst like pimples on my face.
35	4	I’ve been on this pill for about 2 years, it raised by blood pressure, I gained about 20 pounds and my acne got slightly worse.
35	5	I was on yaz for a year and it did a great job at keeping facial hair and acne at bay for my PCOS.
35	6	My daughter was prescribed this pill in February 2017 for acne & to help control her period.
35	7	The acne cleared up & her period was less severe.
35	8	Took this pill for 3 months now, it was effective for regulating my irregular cycle and did a good job on clearing up any skin acne .
35	9	I no longer gain weight and I've had severe acne all my life since I was in elementary school and now I don't have a single pimple on my body!!!!
35	10	Upside: It cleared my acne like in 2 days and helped me lose weight, overall a good medicine for acne, maybe not for a birth control?
35	11	Haven't noticed any changes in acne, unless I'm not paying too much attention.
35	12	Nausea, headaches, acne worse than I've ever had in my life, and the worst, severe anxiety and depression.
35	13	My periods are lighter, my acne has cleared up and it has prevented pregnancy.
35	14	I took this pill for less than two months and my face is now covered in horrible cystic acne and scars.
35	15	It stared when I was 15, and the first few months my face had acne absolutely everywhere; the acne lasted about 3 months.
35	16	Cleared my acne super well and made my period regulated, but I've gained 20 pounds in the past 8 months using it.
35	17	Also, I have never had a problem with acne in my life.
35	18	At 25 yo my acne had subsided from the teenage years, but since I was started on Tri Sprintec it has come back.
35	19	I feel like I am back to being a teenager again with this acne and crazy mood swings.
35	20	I had suffered from moderate acne for years that no matter what I tried, I could not get rid of.
35	21	Within the first month, maybe 2, my acne cleared completely and since then my face is totally clear except for minor pimples that are easily preventable.
35	22	At first I was perfectly fine with this Birth control, but now I suffer from random headaches, my acne is worse, I tend to cry for no reason especially at night before bed, and I'm always in a bad mood.
35	23	The acne is mild to low, but has only gotten worse since I've gotten older, anyways.
35	24	My acne has cleared up and my periods have regulated already back to normal.
35	25	Hasn't affected my weight or acne situation as far as I've noticed tho.
35	26	I have taken this pill for 9 months now my acne has gotten worse I have gained about 15 pounds my cramps are worse and I'm very emotional.
35	27	I was originally put on OrthoTricyclin Lo for my acne, but I couldn't afford it so I was switched to trisprintec.
35	28	I still get a few cramps and acne, but that only happens the day before my period.
35	29	I went on this mostly to clear up my acne and regulate my period.
35	30	Not worth it, it may have helped a little with the acne and regulating periods but the side effects are terrible.
35	31	I hate it I have been taking the tri-sprintec and I can't take it anymore, the side effects are just out of control, I gained weight within the first two weeks of taking it and I don't eat a lot just regular three times; then I started breaking out horribly the first week which I have never had a problem with acne my skin has always been clear of acne.
35	32	This pill worked great for clearing up my acne on my face and back.
35	33	After several months, my cramps have decreased in pain and my acne that I have struggled with for over 5 years is almost completely gone!
35	34	Its cleared up my cystic acne somewhat... Thats all I can think of for the side effects.
35	35	I take the bad with the good, and the whole point of taking it was for acne and avoiding pregnancy and its doing a great job at the avoiding pregnancy thing!
35	36	I also noticed an increase in nausea and acne.
35	37	It's very effective against pregnancy, I believe it helped with acne.
35	38	Started this a few months ago and the first month I had a 4 week long period which was not fun, however I've had no weight gain whatsoever, increased sex drive, and less acne!
35	39	I noticed a change in my acne right away, so I was super optimistic.. and then my period was late by about a week.. and then I got super moody and today i am stuck in bed vommitting.
35	40	A. Triphasic (mirrors natural hormone levels better) B. Estrogen/androgen/progestin ingredients/levels help with acne and C. First two weeks of pills are low dose.
35	41	My acne has gotten a lot better.
35	42	I have suffered from moderate acne since I was a teenage and since taking the pill, my face is completely clear!
35	43	I'm not one to have acne, I just get the occasional pimples or tiny zits, but they're all gone now.
35	44	My chin is constantly breaking out, so it did not help clear up the acne.
35	45	This pill is wonderful and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap and effective contraceptive or acne fix.
35	46	I was on Tri-Sprintec for 2 months and it completely cleared my cystic acne.
35	47	I had terrible, terrible acne for about 7 years before that and it completely scarred my cheeks.
35	48	I started taking Tri-Sprintec months after that ordeal and PMS acne has not been an issue as it had been on the previous birth control.
35	49	My doctor recommended this to me since I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo before and after having a child it no longer worked as well for me and began to cause cystic acne on my chin.
35	50	Very little acne, better than the Trinessa and Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo I was on.
35	51	Although it worked for preventing pregnancy and helped on acne, this pill made me depressed and angry most of the time.
35	52	The not so good things are: my period lasts about ten days; I have really bad mood swings before; it causes nausea and lastly my acne has gotten worse.
35	53	Now, I'm perfectly normal, haven't gained/lost any weight, my cramps are worse than ever the first 2 days of my period each month, my period still lasts a week but it's lighter, my libido has lowered, & I randomly get slight acne (I haven't had acne since I was 13 & I KNOW it's the pill).
35	54	I started taking this birth contol 4 days ago for contraceptive purposes, however I have had terrible cystic acne for the last 3 years of adulthood and its all cleared up.
35	55	To all of those girls (I'm 20 but I'm confident it will work for women of other ages) who think they will never have a clear face and will forever be burdened with horrible pimples, burning acne creams, pills, scrubs etc.
35	56	I have never done a review of anything but felt the need to let all the girls out there with bad acne that there IS help.
35	57	My awful, deep, painful pimples started disappearing and within 2 months I had a perfectly clear face- no acne at all.
35	58	I tried EVERYTHING for my acne and this worked.
35	59	So far, I've had shorter periods (4 days) and I don't notice a lot of acne or emotional issues.
35	60	It completely stopped my acne.
35	61	My breasts have not swelled as much on this pill, my acne has cleared up completely, and I even lost some of the weight I had gained on the last pill since Tri-Sprintec suppressed my appetite.
35	62	But I don't get sick, my periods are about 5 days, and everything is good except my acne.
35	63	I've gained 5 extra pounds, but as far as acne goes its been clear.
35	64	It cleared my acne, my periods were regular, no cramping.
35	65	it cleared up my acne as well, but took a couple months.
35	66	I have never had much of an acne problem, but with this pill my face is always clear.
35	67	No acne.
35	68	But since then my periods have been like clock work and light, I haven't gotten pregnant, my acne is totally under control, and my breasts have increased a little.
35	69	It made my acne disappear a little.
35	70	I never had bad acne but I did notice it getting better after taking these pills.
35	71	My biggest problem with this pill is I now have the worst acne my face has ever seen.
35	72	My face is so broke out with acne from this pill.
35	73	Experienced persistent itching rash (mild allergic reaction), extreme vaginal dryness, fatigue, weight gain, and mild acne (where it used to be controlled on my other pills).
35	74	I had moderately bad acne around my jaw line and cheeks and it disappeared completely in about a month and a half.
35	75	Tri-Sprintec works GREAT when used correctly of course and definitely helps to fight acne.
35	76	If you don't have low estrogen, and you are using Tri-Sprintec, of course you are going to experience unpleasant side effects such as acne, mood swings, weight gain, etc.
35	77	I can effectively lose weight while taking it and have little to no acne.
35	78	I went two months without it and gained weight, also breaking out in acne.
35	79	The only good thing about this pill is that it has helped me with my cystic acne.
35	80	I was hoping it would help with acne and birth control but I have gained 6 pounds in 2 weeks and acne is WORSE and no sex drive.
35	81	I've been getting so much more acne than before I started taking it.
35	82	Doesn't help my acne, my period cramps, or have any other advantages.
35	83	However, my acne (I didn't really have much before) but the little I did have is gone, my face kind of has a glow to it.
35	84	I have not experienced any negative side-effects yet, but I haven't really noticed that it has cleared up my acne any.
35	85	My acne is back full-force (I thought I'd outgrown that!
35	86	I haven't experienced any weight gain, my periods are very manageable overall, and I don't have any acne breakouts.
35	87	I don't have acne problems, the only thing I used to have trouble with was horrible cramps that would cause me to be bed ridden for couple of days, but my period was always light.
35	88	The only positive side effects of this pill is that I have almost no acne now, and my breasts have grown a lot but I have gained 20 pounds within the last year, and I'm wondering if it has anything to do with this pill.
35	89	So the doctor put me on this one for acne.
35	90	I have mild-moderate acne, including acne on my back.
35	91	I'm unsure as to whether the acne on my face is improving or not.
35	92	My acne is a little bit better, but I read that it may take a few months for it to help my skin.
35	93	It also got rid of my acne.
35	94	I was put on Tri-Sprintec to help with my moderate acne.
35	95	I am being taken off of Tri-Sprintec this week because it is interfering with my other acne prescriptions; causing yellowing of my eyes, swelling in my ankles, etc.
35	96	Granted these side effects wouldn't be necessarily happening without my acne medicines.
35	97	So, Bottom line Tri-Sprintec is a good birth control, works well, just not for me with my acne medicines.
35	98	The first few weeks on this pill I had terrible acne!
35	99	I'm not sexually active so my biggest concern isn't getting pregnant however I have moderate acne which I've tried treating with prescriptions and over the counter medicines.
35	100	No PMDD complications and my acne is getting better.
35	101	I'm taking it for a number of reasons, mainly that my period has been irregular for years, my acne is terrible and I'm just trying to be safe and smart.
35	102	I haven't noticed any change in my acne, but I hope it will help soon.
35	103	I choose it because I was told it would help with acne.
35	104	At first, TriSprintec was good for me, it helped my acne (it didn't completely go away) and my boobs got bigger!
35	105	I have pretty bad acne and I heard that this pill could help.
35	106	For the first two weeks my acne was a lot worse but I'm on the third week now and it's all cleared up now.
35	107	About a week in I started getting really REALLY bad acne (just in time for spring semester!)
35	108	During the first 2-3 weeks of the first month my acne got horrible.
35	109	I talked to my dermatologist and she told me that it is a great pill when used for clearing up acne and that my face should look great in 2-4 months.
35	110	But overall, I'm satisfied - no major weight gain that I can tell, and no acne.
35	111	The little acne I did have has been reduced, and in the first week I experienced slight breast tenderness for like 2 or 3 days, but it wasn't bad at all.
35	112	I've been moody and I have a little acne problem but reading these reviews have helped me know that maybe it'll go away.
35	113	I started taking it to clear up my severe acne.
35	114	I had been to dermatologist after dermatologist and had been on every cream and pill to treat my acne and nothing worked until I got on Tri Sprintec.
35	115	I have been on this birth control for the past week and 2 days and I have never in my life experienced depression being on this birth control has made me severely depressed.Very sad cried for 2 days and didn't know why I am 20 and haven't been on bc for like 5 years decided to take this to help with heavy periods .. also I've been throwing up  in the morning my boobs are tender and my face is breaking out I'm going to say DEPRESSED one more time being it is seriously messing with who I am ..
35	116	I got on this, and within a month, my face is breaking out like crazy!
35	117	Stress, food, genetics and physical health are contributors to breaking out too.
35	118	But there was about a week when I took it late everyday and I started breaking out bad.
35	119	My face is also breaking out, which normally only happens when I am PMSing the week before my period.
35	120	When I first started it I only got pimples the week of my period, I had really bad cramps(to the point I threw up every month), and I was really fit.
35	121	The 2 week I noticed a pimple on my nose and that was strange because I haven't had any pimples since a teenager.
35	122	I have been on this birth control for 3 months and for me I only get pimples during the period week, I have gained weight but only 8lbs through out the whole 3 months, and I have a very high sex drive during the second week.
35	123	I have had a couple of pimples pop up but not as bad as the reviews I've seen.
35	124	Downsides, a week or two before my period I feel nausea and a little dizzy also, a couple pimples do show and I have sore breasts.
35	125	It helped with pimples but they get worse before my period but after I'm over then they are gone.
35	126	I do have some red spots from past pimples and once in a while when I'm stressed I'll get a pimple or two but Tri Sprintec is my SAVIOR.
35	127	Before I started taking this pill, I would get really bad cystic pimples on my jawline but I haven't had any since being on this pill.
35	128	The only things I have noticed are I got moody during the first month, and when I do get a blemish (zits, nicks and cuts, bug bites), they tend to last longer.
35	129	Personally I don't get headache, cramps, or pain.
35	130	I originally got on it for my horrible stomach cramps and my irregular period.
35	131	I have awful headaches every day as well as stomach cramps.
35	132	), I have constant headaches and stomach cramps, and frequent diarrhea.
35	133	I am 18 and have been on this for nearly a year now, and originally started this due to severe period cramps that became unbearable.
35	134	There are occasional cramps and sore breasts but that wasn't really a bother to me.
35	135	Besides frustration, I've had cramps throughout and felt feverish at times.
35	136	Never had an issue with headaches or severe cramps.
35	137	They only complaint is that I get worse cramps than before and it made me slightly moody at first but no longer does.
35	138	I also never get cramps anymore.
35	139	The only difference is my periods are lighter and shorter, and my cramps are no longer severe.
35	140	It also did nothing for my cramps during my period, they were terrible and that's not an issue I've had on my previous birth control.
35	141	But now I'm nauseous all the time, I have terrible cramps all of the time.
35	142	Occasionally I get mild period cramps but nothing worse than the norm...you can't escape all the blessings of being a girl!
35	143	It made cramps better and periods lighter.
35	144	I had previously been on Levora for 5 years with the purpose of getting rid of major cramps.
35	145	After 5 years my cramps began to come back so I switched to this one without any precaution.
35	146	I started taking tri sprintec about a year ago for unbearable cramps and it did help out in that department but I wasn't as responsible with taking it at the same time everyday as I am now.
35	147	Pros: no mood swings, no weight gain except in boobs Cons: medium cramps, slight breakthrough bleeding.
35	148	Periods come right on time and I had no clue of her arrival (no cramps, moodiness etc) which I love!
35	149	I always had trouble with my periods; lasted 8 days, super heavy, sick when I started and bad cramps.
35	150	The only side effects I have is light cramps and not as hungry anymore.
35	151	Been having really bad nightmares and cramps.
35	152	No cramps, shortened them from 7 days to 4 days.
35	153	It regulated my period and made my cramps disappear.
35	154	No moodiness or cramps.
35	155	Now my periods are 5 days and I hardly notice my cramps.
35	156	I have severe cramps.
35	157	I started taking Tri-Sprintec a couple of months ago, and I haven't had my period at all, no cramps, my skin is clear, I haven't gained any weight either.
35	158	I also had NO cramps during my period.
35	159	For example I would have a light period, 3 days long, no cramps.
35	160	Then the next month I would have a period for 7 days, heavy period, and horrible cramps.
35	161	I still have cramps but not as bad and I know exactly what day I start my period.
35	162	I experienced horrible cramps and bloating, not just when my period arrived.
35	163	I was on my old birth control for just over a year, but switched pills because of breakthrough bleeding and cramps.
35	164	I'm really moody, get angry easy, I cry for no reason, lower back has been hurting, bad cramps, gaining weight that I can't seem to lose, and me and my boyfriend fight all the time (which we never seemed to do before) and I think if I don't get off it soon then I'd lose him.
35	165	I also have been getting really bad cramps and abdominal pains not just during my period but all the time!
35	166	), my breasts hurt way more and I'm getting nasty period cramps again.
35	167	This has for sure taken care of that, I rarely ever get cramps now.
35	168	I virtually have no cramps and slight breast tenderness each month.
35	169	I was on Tri-Sprintec for 6 months and didn't have any problems with the first 4 months, no headaches, weight gain, or cramps.
35	170	I've had no weight gain, no nausea, no mood swings, and the best part is I don't have near the cramps I used to.
35	171	I haven't had any bad side effects at all, and I no longer get such horrible cramps.
35	172	On Tri Sprintec I experienced weekly migraine headaches, nausea, extremely heavy periods that lasted up to eight days, and horrible cramps that would leave me curled up on the couch and unable to go to school or work.
35	173	I never really got cramps, but when I started taking the pills I started having light cramping before and after my monthly cycle.. but nothing too serious.
35	174	My period was short and light, breast grew a little, no cramps, maybe a little bit emotional but for the most part great.
35	175	Tri-sprintec did reduce my cramps and bloating but it made me very moody and irritable.
35	176	I have not experienced any nausea, cramps, mood swings, or weird bleeding from the pill.
35	177	On Tri-Sprintec my periods are slightly shorter than they used to be, and I hardly have any cramps now, whereas without birth control pills I had terrible cramps for the first two days of my period.
35	178	My periods are MUCH lighter, and the cramps aren't as bad as they used to be.
35	179	No mood swings, no cramps, no sleepiness, or confusing abnormal bleeding that worries you for days it's wonderful.
35	180	There's also been some minor cramping but I just got off of my period before starting so that could be it.
35	181	Nausea, cramping, random bleeding, irritable-- not just irritable..
35	182	I get very nauseous and experience cramping just because I am so (reliant) in a sense, on it.
35	183	The only difference I have noticed is a little bit more cramping, but nothing major.
35	184	The only problem i have had with this pill was that i have gained 25 pounds since i started it last November and i had really bad cramping the week before i started my period.
35	185	But other then that my face is clear, my weight is fine, mild cramping.
35	186	Also, my periods are about the same flow wise, but very little cramping, about 4 days long instead of 5.
35	187	I noticed that I had increased cramping on Tri Sprintec but otherwise it was relatively the same.
35	188	My experience: crying for no reason, complete misery, severe weight gain, anti-social, exhausted, nauseous, dry eyes, high anxiety, NO sex drive, painful sex, cramping, bloating, irrational behavior...
35	189	I never felt moody crampy or had heavy periods.
35	190	I'm not sexually active, but was prescribed it for month-long PMS, spotting and irregular periods.
35	191	First month my period was on time with 3 days of additional spotting.
35	192	First it was light, then heavy (on time for expected period) since the expected end date I have had light bright pink or red spotting for 9 days past my period.
35	193	My boobs hurt all the time, my sex drive has lowered and after I finish my 7 day period I have 6-7 days of spotting.
35	194	I've been taking it for two weeks now and it has made me extremely emotional, nauseous every morning (I take the pill at night), I have no appetite, my boobs are very sore, and I've had spotting after my period for about a week now.
35	195	I had taken one that was supposed to give me 4 periods a year BUT instead I ended up spotting everyday and having mood swings.
35	196	On my 2nd month I had a little spotting but nothing big.
35	197	I haven't had any change of mood, nausea or spotting.
35	198	I had very minor spotting at the start but other than that it's been great!
35	199	And three months after that I'm still experiencing nausea and headaches, but now I have light spotting a couple days before my period, and it doesn't start until 1-3 days after the sugar pills.
35	200	After the 4th pack I started to have spotting and break through bleeding, eventually bleeding for 3 weeks at a time.
35	201	So far I had have had no negative side effects, aside from some spotting during the 3rd week of pills that got heavier the closer I got to the placebo pills week.
35	202	My skin complexion is so much better, my periods are no longer irregular (however I do get spotting the week before my period), libido and weight are the same as when I started, and most importantly, I'm not pregnant.
35	203	I've never had spotting in my life but I have it now, my mood swings are awful, almost cost me my relationship, and the stomach pains are too much to deal with.
35	204	Plus when I did have my period before it lasted a week tops now its like 2 weeks and spotting even a week or two after or before.
35	205	I did not gain any weight, my skin cleared up, my periods were regulated, I did not experience any spotting or anything like that.
35	206	I tried Lo-Estrin24, which caused me to spot and so my doctor thought I needed something a little stronger, so she prescribed me this.
35	207	I just had my first month of it and for the first 3 weeks I spotted continuously and and the fourth week I had no period!
35	208	But I've been nauseous every time I take it with a headache almost daily, more depressed and anxious, I feel angry a lot of the time, and my sex drive is almost completely gone.
35	209	I've also developed a daily headache that starts in the afternoon and lasts until that night.
35	210	Sometimes a little headache but that is it.
35	211	Also, I have a headache every day, am exhausted and I get in a VERY bad mood very fast.
35	212	For example, I am constantly nauseated and always have a headache.
35	213	I ended up quitting my birth control cold turkey on the 6th day of the pack because I couldn't stand the nausea, headaches, and hot flashes.
35	214	Mood swings (I mean MAJOR), headaches (non-stop), irritable, tired (24/7), I just don't have much drive to do a whole lot of anything.
35	215	also gotten some pretty severe headaches.
35	216	Low sex drive, headaches, horrible nausea.
35	217	I've never had any moods swings, depression, headaches, nausea, breast soreness or anything this drug hasn't affected my personality or body at all.
35	218	I switched and realized the headaches were a lot better than the other medicine so I am now switching back to Tri-Sprintec.
35	219	I've never, knock on wood, had any problems with blood clots, quickened heart rate, high blood pressure, headaches, increased appetite, decreased appetite, tenderness of breasts, or an increase in the depression I already suffer from.
35	220	I've been getting really bad headaches, and wanting to throw up after I eat.
35	221	Three weeks in and I have headaches, nausea, and irritability.
35	222	I do get headaches too.
35	223	During the first two months I experienced headaches and slight hair loss around my hairline.
35	224	The first time I took it, I had it for 6-7 months and felt nauseous right after taking it and would get horrible headaches.
35	225	I have been having really bad headaches.
35	226	Then comes heart palpitations, headaches every day since I have been taking them, feel sick.
35	227	Horrible headaches, extreme nausea, black outs, and I was even randomly losing my vision.
35	228	I've been having horrible nausea every day, headaches and feeling irritated.
35	229	Similar to other people I have found myself crying for no reason, anti-social at times, exhausted, dry eyes, significantly lower sex drive, less pleasure, headaches more often then when I wasn't on it and I find myself less patient with others.
35	230	The only discomfort I experienced was some nausea and headaches within the first 3 months or so.
35	231	I feel like it has been the cause of major migraines and headaches for the past year.
35	232	I had no side effects, no yeast infections, no headaches, and my weight remained the same.
35	233	I took them because it was FREE, but those gave me constant yeast infections, headaches, tiredness and my mood swings were insane.
35	234	As far as side effect I did have headaches the 1st 3 days.
35	235	No headaches, no nausea, no weight gain, no breakout problems, and best of all no pregnancy.
35	236	Nausea and headaches, my periods have been up to two weeks longs and I've had much pain during the time of them.
35	237	No depression, headaches, hair loss or breast soreness.
35	238	It also gave me a couple of terrible headaches, which could have been an allergic reaction.
35	239	The only problem I had was that I would get a 2 day migraine on the first pack of pills.
35	240	I always got at least one migraine a month right before my period.
35	241	The 3rd week I began to feel very tired nausea and having migraines all the time even in my sleep.
35	242	My first try was seasonique it was perfect until I got migraines out of this world after 2 months of taking it.
35	243	I've also experienced bad migraines and fatigue.
35	244	Not to mention, it gives you migraines like no other and I will never try this brand ever
35	245	It has given me excruciating stomach aches, nausea, fatigue, migraines, and worst of all it is aggravating my anxiety levels.
35	246	I'd get migraines.
35	247	it has done an amazing job with preventing pregnancy and working with other medicines i take for migraines.
35	248	Well, I have no issues with this pill except it gave me migraines.
35	249	As I started taking this birth control I am not up to about 8 migraines a month.
35	250	Every time a new week started in the pack, I would get migraines.
35	251	I have never had such awful migraines or nausea in my life.
35	252	My sex drive is normal.
35	253	This bc only helped with increasing my sex drive for the first 2 weeks.
35	254	My hair has been falling out constantly, my mood swings are absolutely insane, I have no sex drive, my anxiety has been through the roof, & I feel very depressed (I also feel very bad for my husband trying to deal with me like this)
35	255	So far I have had a CRAZY HIGH sex drive.
35	256	I have been on this brand not a whole yr now and I have experienced mood changes and my sex drive is down the drain.
35	257	The only best thing from this experience is not getting pregnant which I have no sex drive like I'd mentioned.
35	258	It did work to prevent pregnancy, because my sex drive is non-existent.
35	259	My sex drive is pretty much non existent.
35	260	I've taken this bc for 5 years & absolutely loved it but have noticed that within the past two years I've had no sex drive what so ever & can not get wet.
35	261	No weight gain, no mood swings, no depression, no anxiety, no nausea, same sex drive.
35	262	Well I not pregnant but this pill has killed my sex drive.
35	263	Vaginal dryness .... My sex drive is at an all time low and my hormones used to drive me crazy...
35	264	The only positive thing was that I was baby free, and I had an increased sex drive.
35	265	My only complaint is my sex drive is nonexistant .
35	266	the most interesting thing I noticed was actually an increase in my sex drive.
35	267	I have noticed my sex drive has gone down but it works great for a contraceptive.
35	268	From what I can tell, my mood or sex drive hasn't changed at all.
35	269	I have absolutely no sex drive and it's starting to affect my relationship.
35	270	Low sex drive.
35	271	I hated myself, and it didn't help things that my sex drive was nonexistent.
35	272	My sex drive went down, and I wasn't pleased, nor was my boyfriend.
35	273	I was super horny the first week but that has dialed down a little bit but not enough that I have no sex drive.
35	274	I also had extremely decreased libido.
35	275	Also, noticed a decrease in appetite and libido.
35	276	No weight gain yet, no moodiness, didn't seem to affect my libido.
35	277	During the first month it killed my libido and made me grow two cup sizes, but by the second month my libido was back.
35	278	Didn't go crazy, no change in libido (still high).
35	279	I have not had any mood swings in the past week, nor experienced drops/spikes in libido.
35	280	I also didn't have any weight gain and my skin was fine.
35	281	Then In April she began to experience muscle fatigue & weight gain.
35	282	Overall I feel it's a good birth control and it's effective, but I've only been on it for 3 months and when I started this pill I weighed 145lbs and am now weighting about 160... with that being said I'm not happy with my body or myself because I was wondering where this random weight gain came from and then it occurred to me that I started a new birth control.
35	283	my metabolism has slowed down, and my whole self confidence is just gone because of my weight gain.
35	284	I have had no weight gain or mood swings, or any other side effects.
35	285	I have noticed when I take the pill at night before bed I instantly have cravings but luckily I'm able to control it to avoid weight gain.
35	286	I have had weight gain and water retention.
35	287	It worked well as a birth control, i just don't like the side effects of weight gain.
35	288	Haven't noticed any sorts of mood effects and no weight gain.
35	289	It causes no mood swings or weight gain for me.
35	290	Not to mention the weight gain and my boobs got bigger.
35	291	Weight gain  ...
35	292	I didn't experience any weight gain, However, I did go through a very traumatic 4 month phase before I stopped taking it.
35	293	I've had no weight gain.
35	294	I was previously on LoEsterin and I had significant weight gain, so this stuff is miraculous!
35	295	No weight gain, nothing.
35	296	I don't mind the weight gain or the fact that I am constantly eating/snacking since I'm pretty active and my metabolism surprisingly keeps up w/my cravings.
35	297	It's too soon to know it's birth control effectiveness, or it's affects on weight gain yet for me.
35	298	The biggest thing I've noticed is lack of sexual drive but my skins clear, little weight gain, and no hair loss.
35	299	My face is clear and I haven't suffered from any weight gain, although I do have some PMS mood swings sometimes but I've been on this pill for almost two years and its definitely helped this 22yr old.
35	300	To me the weight gain was not worth it.
35	301	I play soccer and work out a lot and i eat healthy and the weight gain has got me really down so im probably going to talk to my doctor about changing pills.
35	302	However, I have had a weight gain of about twenty pounds on this medicine despite the fact that I was actually exercising more than I did previously.
35	303	I've always had problems gaining weight and had been about 105 lbs for quite a few years so a few pounds wouldn't have hurt, but this weight gain was pretty troubling due to how rapid it was.
35	304	It did cause some weight gain but not much more than 5-7 lbs.
35	305	No weight gain if anything, I've lost weight.
35	306	I'm just about to finish up my first month and so far I've had no noticeable mood changes or weight gain.
35	307	While I enjoy this weight gain (for now) Its hard to recommend this to anyone else since everyone's body is different.
35	308	Have never had weight gain.
35	309	Mood swings, bloating, and weight gain.
35	310	I never noticed any weight gain due to this pill.
35	311	My biggest fear was weight gain.
35	312	As for weight gain, absolutely NONE.
35	313	I did experience weight gain and an increase in appetite earlier, but it went away after the first couple of months.
35	314	The weight gain and the inability to lose it has been unbearable, which is why I'm switching to a lower dosage pill.
35	315	I was concerned with the nausea, vomiting and weight gain that others talked about but had none.
35	316	I haven't had any break outs, weight gain or emotional problems.
35	317	No significant weight gain in this past week, however I do feel my sports bras tightening up.
35	318	No side effects, 1-2 pounds weight gain (I watched my diet to the T so I knew the extra weight was from the pill) But it did not bother me too much.
35	319	I gained an extra 10 pounds within week one and mid of week three, I call my gyno and had to have my pill changed because I could not accept the 10 pound weight gain.
35	320	No weight gain, slightly bigger breasts but not complaining.
35	321	I have gained a bit of weight since I started taking it 4 months ago.
35	322	I have gained 20 pounds at least from this in two months (how is that even possible?
35	323	I haven't gained weight and I think I've lost weight instead so that's a plus considering the breast increase.
35	324	I've never been pregnant or gained weight.
35	325	I was on this pill for about 3 years and i have gained 25 lbs since.
35	326	I gained a lot of weight in my belly and boobs.
35	327	I gained about five pounds, and I really feel like it increases bloating and abdominal discomfort because that's what I get immediately after I take my pill.
35	328	Works great, but definitely gained weight.
35	329	I gained about 30 pounds while on it.
35	330	First time I was on it, I gained 25 pounds in 3 months.
35	331	My only complaint is I have gained 20 pounds but I also stopped breastfeeding at the same time I started so I dont know which is the cause.
35	332	Have not gained weight.
35	333	I gained weight on the pill but I'm not sure if it was because of the pill or because I started college.
35	334	Don't take that pill, I gained a lot of weight, I got depressed and with anxiety, I always wanted to eat...
35	335	I was depressed and gained 8 pounds.
35	336	I started eating a lot more and gained 3 pounds in the first week.
35	337	I was on this birth control from September to April (last full month taking it)> At first I didn't have any problems, but by the third month I was crazy emotional and would cry for no reason, my boobs grew from a B to a big C almost a D, and I gained about 7 on it and felt constantly bloated.
35	338	Haven't gained any weight but I also work out regularly and eat healthy.
35	339	Haven't gained any weight, and it makes my period regular.
35	340	I haven't gained any weight because I try to keep that under control, but it is hard.
35	341	I also gained about 16 lbs from the time I started taking this pill until now.
35	342	I gained 20 pounds in about a month without changing my diet.
35	343	I gained 40 pounds on it, and it affected me tremendously.
35	344	I haven't gained any weight.
35	345	Good birth control but I gained about 10-15 lbs in two months from it, with regular exercise, etc.
35	346	I gained 20 lbs on it and rapidly lost it in a month when I switched to another brand.
35	347	The only thing that happened when I went on this medication that may be displeasing to others is that I gained about 30 pounds.
35	348	Within those years I gained 30 pounds and my cup size has tripled.
35	349	I am 122 pounds and I maybe gained 4 pounds when taking these pills.
35	350	I gained 6 pounds but I think it was water.
35	351	I have gained about 15 pounds though.
35	352	However I have been on this medicine for 4 months and have gained 9 pounds (from 127lbs- 136lbs).
35	353	She's gained alot of weight, she got whiney, and doesn't know how to control her anger.
35	354	My periods still begin on the same day and I have not gained any weight since I have switched  (8 months ago).
35	355	I cry at inappropriate times, I'm moody and I've gained weight.
35	356	Also, I gained almost ten pounds in one month which is completely not normal because I could barely eat since the pill made me nauseous and dizzy at least a few times a week.
35	357	I have gained SO MUCH WEIGHT its ridiculous and I hardly eat anything yet it makes me want food all the time.
35	358	My scale says I only gained under 5 pounds, and there is no change anywhere else on my body weight-wise.
35	359	I am on my second pack and I feel like I have gained a whole other person and my breasts feel and look enormous.
35	360	Needless to say, due to MY fault, I gained about 20 lbs back - but in a womanly way.
35	361	I have tried everything to lose weight and have only gained weight.
35	362	I have also gained a noticeable amount of weight since starting the pill.
35	363	I also gained about 8 pounds with in the first month and my appetite was way up, i was hungry all the time.
35	364	I have been a little bloated but I haven't gained weight.
35	365	I've gained a lot of weight in the worst places even though I've been going to the gym more and eating better and I SWEAR my breast size has actually gone down.
35	366	I haven't lost any weight, but I haven't gained any.
35	367	I am not starting this new pill until I lose the weight I have gained from Tri-Sprintec.
35	368	I did notice a bit of nausea in the beginning, but that should go away.
35	369	I started to get extremely bloated, gassy, nausea, and heartburn.
35	370	The nausea, fatigue, and dizziness every single day really took a toll on me physically and emotionally.
35	371	The first thing I noticed was the nausea, and the ill feeling I had throughout the whole day.
35	372	Other than nausea and vomiting when I first started I have no complaints.
35	373	I started off the first couple months with lots of nausea and my breasts were constantly sore.
35	374	Other than the breast soreness and nausea, I didn't gain any weight or have any other issues.
35	375	I started taking this medication about a month ago and noticed within the first week terrible mood swings, severe nausea, and a huge change to my motivations and relationships.
35	376	I needed something that was going to take away my nausea and vomitting when it came time for my period to start.
35	377	I just take it at night now to help with nausea.
35	378	Once I was off of it for a year I never tried anything so recently I decided to give it another shot because I feel more responsible with it and I am, I've been taking it every day on time for the first month, when I went to refill my prescription they didn't refill me for 4 days , I went 4 days without taking the pill & I have never felt more horrible from it , nausea, the whole 9 yards.
35	379	Felt very nausea for 2 weeks.
35	380	After the nausea went away my boobs felt a little sore.
35	381	The first month was okay but around the 2nd month I started having terrible nausea at nighttime.
35	382	No change in weight or appetite other than not wanting to eat because of the nausea.
35	383	I have now been off of trisprintec for about a week & haven't had any nighttime nausea at all.
35	384	The nausea was mild-moderate during the first few months and I still occasionally feel mildly nauseous (nothing unmanageable, though).
35	385	For the first week or two I noticed increased nausea and breast tenderness, the nausea subsided but the breast tenderness still lingers (just not as bad).
35	386	No complaints other than the 1-2 nights of nausea I experience when I start a new pack.
35	387	During the first month and a half, I would get spells of nausea about 2-3 hours after taking the pill, but these eventually went away.
35	388	Never got any severe side effects; some nausea the first week, but that's about it.
35	389	I had no complications with this birth control other than minor nausea in the mornings.
35	390	I've lost my appetite, I've had bloating, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and I'm very moody.
35	391	I never had any of the nausea others have written about.
35	392	I've been taking Tri-Sprintec for 2 years and the only time I experienced any side effects was the first month and it was nausea around my period.
35	393	Another thing was I always get nausea and I wouldn't eat anything.
35	394	Maybe a little nausea the past month.
35	395	I've been on Tri Sprintec for 3 months now and noticed sickness and nausea the first week of taking these pills.
35	396	I have had no bad side effects whatsoever; the only is a very mild nausea that is manageable.
35	397	The first 2 weeks I did feel a bit of nausea, mostly right after taking the pill (I take it at night).
35	398	A little nausea for about 30 minutes after taking the pill, periods were lighter and a bit longer.
35	399	Overall, Tri Sprintec wasn't all that bad - no breakthrough bleeding, no moodiness, no nausea, etc.
35	400	I didn't have any nausea or mood swings, although a few times I have gotten more aggravated at little things people do.
35	401	Side effects include bad nausea for the first month, and my period randomly started too early just yesterday (2nd week of my 2nd month).
35	402	I have not experienced any nausea or any other stomach problems.
35	403	It started out okay and I was fine with the outcome despite the nausea.
35	404	Of course the first month or two I had the nausea and I still wasn't "regular," but after those few months it's been smooth sailing.
35	405	The worst thing about it is occasional nausea.
35	406	However after that I started to feel very nauseated my first week of a pack and then became so depressed during the second week that I could not get out of bed.
35	407	The first couple of months I was a little nauseated when I took it, but that has gone away.
35	408	At first I thought just I hadn't gotten used to it yet but as more time has went on I am hateful, severely depressed, nauseated, very tired, and constantly just an unhappy person.
35	409	I think taking my pill right before sleeping is the best, and that way I am only nauseated if I wake up really early.
35	410	Anyways when I first took the pill I noticed from the first day I was nauseous.
35	411	I also felt nauseous a lot and on the first day of my last period I had to miss school because of it.
35	412	At first I hadn't noticed a difference between the two, but about a few weeks in I noticed that I started to feel a lot more nauseous.
35	413	This is my second month taking it and my breast are so sore first month I took it I was fine I feel nauseous all the time I'm gaining a lot of weight it's sad never had I felt like this on bc  but only one more month left .
35	414	It makes me terribly nauseous, to the point where I will throw up about 4 times a day.
35	415	The only issue I have is that I can't take the pill in the morning or during that day at all it makes me nauseous and one time I threw up because of it.
35	416	I Just started this bc last week tues and I'm already feeling nauseous every so often.
35	417	I felt nauseous constantly and experienced severe anxiety.
35	418	I constantly felt nauseous and even made me throw up sometime.
35	419	The second and worst side effect would be that I was constantly nauseous even after the first three months.
35	420	So I'd recommend having a snack if you start to feel nauseous, it's only happened to me twice but it's just not a good feeling.
35	421	My breasts are huge, weight increased and I was nauseous for a week straight, not to mention the whole point of me taking this was to know when my period was, well I never started when the pill said I should.
35	422	I was nauseous at 1st but taking it right before bed helped.
35	423	I'd wake up either really nauseous or starving.
35	424	You will become tired quickly, feel like vomiting, nauseous and go through a number of mood swings throughout the day.
35	425	My skin has been out of control with painful bumps since I've started it, I've actually LOST weight from being nauseous all the time, and my mood swings have been absolutely awful.
35	426	Although I was slightly nauseous in the beginning, my skin (which got pretty bad during my pregnancy) started marginally improving and to my surprise my mood was perfectly fine.
35	427	I am on day 8 and am getting more nauseous by the day.
35	428	The Pharmacist assured me that Trinessa and Tri-Sprintec are the exact same medicines, just made by two different manufacturers, but I have never felt so nauseous in my life.
35	429	I have been extremely nauseous, crying for no apparent reason and bickering with my Boyfriend.
35	430	I suffered from out of the blue panic attacks, dizziness, racing thoughts - the entire gambit of unstable mental capacity.
35	431	Also mood swings.
35	432	The week before my period I am doing good, but the last 2 days I get mood swings and craving of food.
35	433	The last week before my placebo week has always kind of made me have mood swings.
35	434	I took this birth control for a week and began having uncontrollable mood swings.
35	435	BADDD MOOD SWINGS!
35	436	I had mood swings, I had moments were I felt depressed.
35	437	I no longer feel depressed or have crazy mood swings.
35	438	I've never had mood swings or anxiety like this before.
35	439	I have never been a sad person but since I started taking this pill I have been extremely depressed and have had terrible mood swings.
35	440	I have terrible, terrible mood swings.
35	441	And don't let me get started with the mood swings.
35	442	Very irritable and horrible mood swings.
35	443	It's been great overall, but lately, I've been extremely depressed for absolutely no reason, and my mood swings have been terrible(I go from contemplating killing someone to crying in a matter of seconds) and felt like I lost the need to live until I started thinking, maybe it's my birth control?
35	444	After the first month or so I began experiencing noticeable mood swings that would occur during any time of my cycle.
35	445	No weight gains, just a few mood swings around my period but that's about it.
35	446	I have really had some bad mood swings of just feeling really sad and my anxiety has been pretty bad.
35	447	I don't get mood swings.
35	448	Since I started it each month my skin has gotten clearer and the PMS mood swings before my period are getting better.
35	449	A good tip is to keep a journal once you start a new pill so you can keep track of break downs, mood swings and how often they're happening.
35	450	I have few mood swings before my periods come.
35	451	My face has cleared completely, no mood swings, and no fatigue.
35	452	It also caused bad mood swings.
35	453	Like many of the other women I have bad mood swings, am very emotional all of the time, and the way I have been mentally and emotionally lately is interfering with relationships.
35	454	No mood swings unlike some other pills.
35	455	I've been taking it for over a year, and my family says I'm a much more pleasant person to be around now that I have something ridding me of my terrible mood swings.
35	456	I have been taking Tri-Sprintec for a month and about a week now, I have been having crazy mood swings that is causing me to not want to do anything, argue with my partner, then be fine 10 minutes later.
35	457	It really has made my relationship with my parents and boyfriend not so good because of my mood swings!
35	458	I have a lot more mood swings and am usually depressed and feel terrible about myself.
35	459	And after a few months I started to have really strong mood swings.
35	460	I have been on it for 3 months and have noticed my mood swings are up and down.
35	461	I get mood swings when I"m on the 2nd week of the pack.
35	462	I had severe mood swings and depression which lasted for the entire 4 months I was on it.
35	463	I also started to have severe mood swings, that got so bad they affected my work and I had to schedule an appointment with my GC.
35	464	I have not gotten pregnant and I don't have mood swings.
35	465	This is not including the terrible mood swings that almost drove me and my boyfriend apart.
35	466	Lately I've had the most ridiculous PMS and mood swings.
35	467	However, after two months I began to notice myself having mood swings.
35	468	I had horrible mood swings and would just feel like I could break down crying at any particular moment.
35	469	I normally do not have mood swings, even around my period, but within the first few days of taking Tri-Sprintec I had to call my doctor and switch pills.
35	470	My mood swings are having an affect on my relationship, my kids and husband, as I am less patient and more tired.
35	471	Due to insurance I had to switch to Trinessa, heavier periods and more mood swings followed.
35	472	My boyfriend says my moods are way worse than they ever were before and my mood swings are pretty bad sometimes.
35	473	I was very nervous to start again because I had so many negative experiences in the past with the pill which ultimately led me to quit BC altogether.
35	474	I started feeling extremely anxious and like I was going to die.
35	475	Bad side effects awful insomnia and felt so anxious and moody for 3 months, something I never felt before.
35	476	I used to be really nice and laugh at just about anything but now while on this pill I just feel super anxious and I even think this raises my blood pressure.
35	477	I am tired of my moods changing and feeling panicky and worried and anxious and I know its this pill.
35	478	I when taking this pill I had feelings of anxiety and such horrible insomnia I would wake up at night an hour into sleeping and just never go back to sleep.
35	479	I saw my doctor who let me know that what I was experiencing is called anxiety attacks.
35	480	I've never had anxiety didn't even know what an anxiety attack was but this side effect is debilitating
35	481	I would even get a tingling sensation in my hand and my legs would feel extremely heavy which caused major anxiety.
35	482	It made my anxiety 3x worse, and it also made me depressed to the point where it was getting crippling, and I couldn't go through the day without feeling like I needed to cry, at the most random times.
35	483	Every third week of the month I get severe depression, anxiety is through the roof which then leads to insomnia and a constant feeling of dread.
35	484	I have had severe anxiety and loss of motivation since starting this 2 months ago.
35	485	Since starting Tri Sprintec my anxiety is through the roof, which exacerbates my depression to the point of me having suicidal thoughts on a daily basis.
35	486	I thought maybe it was my immagination (because obviously three days isnt long enough to actually get a feel for what a medication is like) but after reading the reviews depression and anxiety seem like a normal side effect.
35	487	If you have depression and anxiety I really don't recommend this pill because in my own experience, already knowing I have it, it made life a living hell during the last two weeks.
35	488	Every night this week I've cried for no reason and I constantly feel depressed and my anxiety has been very bad.
35	489	My anxiety and depression were already bad but this pill just zaps all my energy and motivation and puts me in extremely bad moods that affect my relationships.
35	490	I used to cry, get anxiety,  and have suicidal thoughts around my period and those have completely gone away.
35	491	I am starting to have really bad anxiety and i quit i didnt even finish the whole back.
35	492	3 weeks into taking this birth control I experienced severe anxiety, debilitating panic attacks that sent me to urgent care and kept me from working, depression, sensitivity to light and sound, racing heart, insomnia, and a complete personality change for the worse.
35	493	I no longer have anxiety about going to bed at night, or driving on fast roads, or anything else that used to shut me down before.
35	494	All I do is want to cry, my anxiety is crazy high, I am depressed.
35	495	I have problems with depression and anxiety but I do believe it stabilized that and helped just a bit.
35	496	Not only is my anxiety getting out of control but I also feel depressed and uninterested in everything.
35	497	Let's see,  I had anxiety attacks.
35	498	I've never in life had anxiety attacks, not even anxiety.
35	499	Had severe anxiety.
35	500	I have been getting more moody than I normally am and I almost had 3 anxiety attacks.
35	501	I did quit for other personal reasons about 2 months ago and have had anxiety.
35	502	My emotions were a constant roller coaster, I developed severe anxiety, and I couldn't understand why I was always depressed.
35	503	Little did I know that it had 3 estrogen levels that increase over the month which he said could definitely be responsible for my 8 months of sudden anxiety and increased emotions.
35	504	I also feel like it is starting to cause slight anxiety and panic attacks.
35	505	The only side effect is the breast pain and swelling.
35	506	I have had minimum issues (occasional breast tenderness-- no big deal).
35	507	My breasts have gotten a bit larger and this week (3rd) I have some mild breast tenderness.
35	508	The only difference is I really didn't experience breast tenderness with my other birth controls but with this one my breasts are tender & also I'm not quite sure when I'm suppose to start my period; I'm on my third inactive pill and haven't got it yet.
35	509	A week before my period I do develop breast tenderness.
35	510	Just some breast tenderness right before my period and cravings every now and then.
35	511	No breast tenderness.
35	512	This birth control so far has done me well, my symptoms are tender breasts and fatigue.
35	513	I never got sick I felt a little light headed no sore breasts or anything my stomach did feel a little weird but like most meds you should eat at least an hour before taking it.
35	514	They do cause sore breasts but it eventaully goes away.
35	515	I haven't experienced any side effects other than sore breasts.
35	516	The first 2 months my breasts hurt - they grew another cup size - but after that there's been no extra tenderness at all.
35	517	Also pretty sure it's the reason I've been having constant yeast infections for months now.
35	518	Not chronic but 3 yeast infections in the last two years.
36	1	My face looks terrible, due to all of the acne from Trinessa.
36	2	My acne is completely gone.
36	3	Been on it a little over a year now, it cleared my HORRIBLE PAINFUL acne!
36	4	On top of clearing my acne it also shortened my cycle from 7 days to 4, a much lighter period that isn’t getting in the way of my life, this pill also significantly reduced the amount of migraines that I get.
36	5	Causes dark acne spots and severe nausea at night.
36	6	The first few weeks appeared to be normal, but I have horrible cystic acne.
36	7	Orthotri-low helped significantly with it, but with TriNessa, my acne was coming back and in waves.
36	8	I was OK for the first 3 years of my life, acne great, no weight gain, no irregular bleeding, but my period was heavy and my mood swings were absolutely insane.
36	9	My acne has been terrible the entire time I've used this birth control.
36	10	I never had issues with acne on this medication which was great, so definitely good for that.
36	11	Going to try mononessa next because I have bad acne right now.
36	12	Kept taking it for a third month, symptoms got worse, even started gaining weight and acne!
36	13	But it worked so well for me, cleared my acne, easy periods, no problems....until last week.
36	14	I have been using trinessa for 2 months now and my acne is almost completely nonexistent.
36	15	I also started breaking out in acne everywhere.
36	16	I drink plenty of water use the usual creams and soaps and still have acne in exactly the same places for the past month.
36	17	It's been really good still I stopped taking the birth control pill I got acne again, my period was late by 10 days and it lasted for 3 days only.
36	18	I now have acne so I am going to the dermatologist to get a prescription for that.
36	19	I have had horrible cystic acne since I was 18, which gets worse around my period.
36	20	I rarely get cystic acne anymore, and my skin just looks so much better and healthier.
36	21	I have always had bad acne even in my 30's & on Ortho.
36	22	I got a prescription for trinessa about  5 months ago, mostly just to help with my acne, and so far so good.
36	23	My acne hasn't completely gone away, but it does help.
36	24	Only thing is my boobs feel bigger and fuller which is a plus and my acne is subsiding.
36	25	I didn't gain weight or have issues with acne.
36	26	Haven't noticed a difference in my acne but time will tell!
36	27	I'm on  my 7th month now on this pill and it helps my adult acne at least 90%, I still get this occasional breakout before my period but it's very mild.
36	28	This pill have controlled my acne, my face used to be soo oily especially towards the end of the day and that experience totally stopped.
36	29	I never have had bad acne at all but the first month I was on it I had terrible acne but that's normal and now I'm seeing I get acne more the week before my period on this pill.
36	30	It did get rid of my cystic acne, but I always had little zits all month.
36	31	This made my acne worse, I have sleepless nights, and I constantly struggle with being down and not being happy.
36	32	My acne is loads better, my boobs got bigger.
36	33	I'm almost 40 and have had a problem with acne my whole life, even while being on the Ortho Tri-Cyclen lo.
36	34	I liked Ortho TCLo because I had no side effects and it cleared my adult acne.
36	35	Although my acne is still clear, my mood swings are unpredictable and heavy.
36	36	I have never really had much in the way of  acne but with this I never even get a pimple.
36	37	As for my acne, it seemed to clear up a bit at first but right around the time my period is starting, it gets horrible again.
36	38	This works wonders with my acne, but it makes me absolutely sick to my stomach.
36	39	So far my cramps have still been horrible, and my acne has worsen since I've been on the pill.
36	40	Prior to taking Trinessa, I had some acne but ever since, I have clear skin and rarely ever get a pimple.
36	41	So far it's been great with helping my painful periods, clearing up acne, and preventing pregnancy.
36	42	I have little to no acne thanks to these.
36	43	I began taking this medicine primarily to not get pregnant and a little for the acne part.
36	44	It helps with acne, and to not get pregnant.
36	45	Not only have I developed acne, I've been having palpitations, racing hart beat, depression, severe anxiety, chest pain & heaviness and to top it off UNBEARABLE migraines every.single.day!
36	46	Also my acne has gotten worse.
36	47	I've had a positive experience, period is on time, acne is going away, no spotting, no weight gain.
36	48	I started taking this medication primarily for birth control and acne treatment.
36	49	It didn't really do anything to improve my acne and I still get the hormonal acne along the jaw line.
36	50	I am currently only taking it for clearing my acne (be warned my acne came back only a week after being off of it and was much worse than before) and till my prescription ends.
36	51	No weight gain, no acne, lighter shorter periods.
36	52	I have been on Trinessa in the past for acne and it had worked beautifully.
36	53	Lots of chin acne.
36	54	But after three months, everything went back to normal, and my acne decreased I had occasional zits here and there but now my skin is completely clear.
36	55	I did not break out a lot before Trinessa, but now even during the week I get my period, I have zero acne, and I am talkin no zits at all.
36	56	I had minor acne which is all gone and I never break out.
36	57	No help with acne though!
36	58	My acne cleared up which was an extreme plus.
36	59	I am 14 years old and am taking it for consistency in my period, acne, and consistent flow.
36	60	My acne has not improved, these to things are very devastating to my confidence.
36	61	Before the pill, I rarely if ever had acne and prided myself on a clear complexion.
36	62	Now, my face is a war zone, I have awful acne and acne scaring.
36	63	My doctor prescribed it for hormonal acne I had.
36	64	I didn't notice it clearing my acne for about 2 or 3 months but it's worth the wait.
36	65	My acne is still present occasionally, but that is definitely due to genetics.
36	66	Also, weight gain, some acne (which I never experienced my whole life) and terrible PMS.
36	67	It gives me my period every month around the same couple days after a few months of starting the pill, my acne was all cleared, and I had 2 migraines In 8 months and no daily headaches like usual.
36	68	I got it to control my acne and to prevent pregnancy.
36	69	My sex drive is the same, still waiting for acne control, and I haven't experienced increased discharge.
36	70	So hopefully the cramps stop and my acne calms down.
36	71	My acne is improving, after taking a terrible hit during the first month.
36	72	No acne and predictable periods.
36	73	My acne hasn't even cleared its gotten worse
36	74	I was on trinessa for 4.5 years, originally went on it to control my acne, which it did for the most part, but definitely not 100%, despite having a strict face cleansing routine.
36	75	Im going off of it now because in the past week I have noticed I'm breaking out a lot and i think I've been on this too long for it to keep controlling my acne.
36	76	My acne cleared right up after about 6 months, my period became regular, I stopped getting cramps (I get like a stomach ache now) and I had no negative side effects what so ever.
36	77	But the improvements in my acne on the other pill unraveled a bit.
36	78	I get acne just like I did before ever going on birth control.
36	79	My Gyno prescribed me Trinessa since I had been having irregular periods for a while, the pills had no side effects with me & it cleared up my acne pretty well.
36	80	Trinessa is the only birth control I've been able to find that both helps with acne and doesn't destroy my sex drive.
36	81	My acne is clearing up, it's an effective contraceptive, and, to my surprise, I've actually lost weight.
36	82	My acne was almost gone with this medication, and less hormonal during my time of the month.
36	83	I've noticed that I'm getting mild acne and experience minor fatigue.
36	84	Been on Trinessa for 8 years for mild acne and birth control.
36	85	At first it helped with my acne significantly, but it also made me gain 15 lbs (even though I was working out like usual); I feel like the medication decreased my exercise tolerance and motivation.
36	86	Now that I'm in PA school my acne has returned.
36	87	Hair stopped falling out, lost 4 pounds in 3 weeks, no mood swings, super happy all the time, flawless skin even tho Necon gave me acne but I don't have it naturally.
36	88	I came off of Depo Provera...endless spotting and I got the worst acne of my life.
36	89	I was on the shot for about 3yrs but decided to change to a birth control, and my Doctor recommended Tri-Nessa since I had mild acne.
36	90	My acne cleared up.
36	91	Also I've had bad acne for years and to be honest it hadn't all went away but it has not gotten worse at all.
36	92	Positives: I'm not pregnant, and it really has cleared up my acne.
36	93	My acne has cleared up a little bit but not entirely.
36	94	It cleared my acne.
36	95	No pregnancy scares, no weight gain, and no acne.
36	96	Plus cleared up my acne!
36	97	I didn't have my period at all, minor cramps and my acne is disappearing so quickly.
36	98	I have never had a problem with acne, but I seemed to develop these tiny bumps as soon as I started Trinessa.
36	99	I initially started taking it so I could have a normal, predictable, period and to see if it would clear up my acne.
36	100	Not only has it kept me from being pregnant, it keeps my skin mostly acne clear and my periods very short and light.
36	101	The only positive so far is that my acne is going away.
36	102	I have only noticed my acne getting worse, but the medication is inexpensive and effective, so I can't complain too much.
36	103	I'm getting older and my hormones are changing, (I'm 28) but being on TriNessa this time around, my breasts have been sore for 2 weeks, and my normally clear skin has now turned into a breeding ground for bright red painful acne cysts.
36	104	It cleared up most of my acne scaring and I have been on it for 2 years now and had no pregnancy scares ever and I do it unprotected a lot.
36	105	I originally was placed on the pill to control my VERY painful pains and cramps during my periods, and to help control acne.
36	106	It made no improvement on my acne though.
36	107	First month I immediately started breaking out like crazy and it only worsened as the time went by.
36	108	Currently, I have horrible mood swings, depression, and my skin is breaking out like crazy.
36	109	I'm also breaking out in hives.
36	110	My skin began breaking out, so my doctor switched me to Trinessa about 4-5 months ago, and I am a walking disaster area.
36	111	No pimples, my period is lighter, I also use to get the worst cramps and nausea and now no cramps, or anything.
36	112	The only down side to this is before I started I had clear skin didn't get pimples or zits nothing but after I started this I got a couple pimples.
36	113	I do get a couple zits around my period but other than that I'm cleared up.
36	114	I'd get 1-3 zits whenever I had my period.
36	115	During my period I still get a few zits, but not bad enough to wear makeup.
36	116	My cramps are horrendous and make me call into work sick.
36	117	Other than that I don't have any noticeable symptoms and my periods are much more manageable, I used to have horrid cramps but not anymore!
36	118	I started Trinessa because I had horrible cramps to the point where I would lay on the bathroom floor for days, and my doctor said that it would fix this.
36	119	I have cramps the first day of my menstrual cycle for the first time in my life and I'm 32 years old.
36	120	My period has also gotten shorter and lighter and I hardly get cramps at all.
36	121	I don't have breast tenderness,  cramps or discomfort either.
36	122	I started it the 1st day of my period and it was super heavy and full of blood clots and I had cramps for 3 days.
36	123	I used to have cramps the first day and would last about 6 days.
36	124	now my period lasts about 4 days with and I don't have any cramps!
36	125	My periods are 3-4 days, pretty light with no cramps.
36	126	After 2 weeks of taking this pill, I've had cramps and spotting every day and feel very bloated and irritable.
36	127	My periods are much lighter and cramps are almost nonexistent.
36	128	I use to never get cramps and now I get them on the first day of my period.
36	129	I just started Trinessa but so far it's been good I used to have really bad nausea before and during my period really bad cramps and my period was 7 days long and extra heavy.
36	130	The moodiness I encountered during my period was gone, my period was lighter, my cramps albeit the first day they were there they were significantly weaker.
36	131	Before I started the pills, I would have horrible cramps and long, heavy periods and now other than heavy nausea in the first week and some diarrhea, my periods are short and rather light.
36	132	Periods are still heavy, cramps are really bad.My sex drive is just gone.
36	133	My period used to be a week long and now it lasts four days and it's pretty light and I do not get any cramps.
36	134	I do still get cramps but nothing a motion can't fix.
36	135	No cramps with little bloating.
36	136	My cramps improved drastically and I was still hormonal, just less.
36	137	Terrible bloating the week before my period as well as nausea/vomiting and bad cramps a few days before.
36	138	The bloating is horrible, the cramps don't usually last for more than 1 day.
36	139	My skin is clear, my periods are usually only 4 days long with no severe cramps, and I haven't had any noticeable side effects like mood swings or weight gain.
36	140	I have had very bad cramps; they are so bad that my back even hurts.
36	141	My periods went from 5 days to 4, and I no longer get the debilitating cramps and body aches I used to have for three days every month.
36	142	The only side effects I have now are bad cramps and back aches but other than that.. LOVE IT!
36	143	I have TERRIBLE back and stomach cramps, but my bleeding isn't so bad.
36	144	I went to the doctor because I had horrible cramps.
36	145	The pain from the cramps made me vomit and have diarrhea.
36	146	Triness has definitely made my period cramps lighter, which is great.
36	147	For reference, I experience very heavy cramps and bleeding and about a week long period when not on birth control.
36	148	The cramps that I used to have sent me home sick, and my period lasted 15 days once!
36	149	It's my first time using birth control and I wanted to get on it to help regulate my periods and to help with cramps.
36	150	My periods have lost some of the cramps, but this pill does not make them any shorter.
36	151	As I continue to take this medication, my periods have become lighter and shorter, but at the same time, I still have cramps and abdomen pains for all 7 days.
36	152	I started having unusual menstrual-like and lower abdominal cramps, indigestion, bloating, heartburn that did not go away.
36	153	My period never starts until the 5th placebo,and has always been short, but I no longer cramp!
36	154	I basically cramp everyday or every other day.
36	155	My mood swings are insane, cramping makes me nauseous, and I would bleed for five to seven days.
36	156	The pill did reduce my cramping but increased my bitchiness!
36	157	One of the very first side effects of this drug was spotting which I was ok with, but during the very first two months I experiences horrible cramping, way worse than the cramping of my usual period, I literally felt like my uterus was going to explode...it hurt that bad.
36	158	My complaint is the cramping!
36	159	I still have a little bit of cramping before my period but doctor says that is normal and no pill can really prevent that.
36	160	The only downside so far has been a little bit of stomach cramping.
36	161	I experienced cramping, bloating, and nausea starting on week 2 of the pill pack.
36	162	I would get 2 a month and they would last 9 days and now I have a normal period that comes once a month and only lasts about 5 days and no more getting sick and crampy either.
36	163	I also experienced horrible spotting, my periods would last almost 2 weeks with TriNessa.
36	164	Only downside is that I start spotting a week before my period but I also haven't been taking for 3 months yet so I may stop spotting early.
36	165	So far in the past 5 months I had experienced the random nausea in the beginning, irregular spotting (which still happened to me last month), and I felt a bit more emotional.
36	166	I have been on this pill for about 2 1/2 months and compared to my previous prescription (which I had no period, just spotting at the end of the month) this is horrible.
36	167	I have not stop bleeding either I have been spotting the entire time and as I go along it seems to get heavier.
36	168	TriNessa initially caused mood swings (have subsided since) and spotting for two packs straight.
36	169	I also started to have quite a bit of spotting for the last year and a half.
36	170	I switched to this to help with my spotting but I feel like I'd take the spotting over this any day!
36	171	And it's light very light like spotting.
36	172	In the first 2 months or so of starting Trinessa I had spotting.
36	173	But since I have been on TriNessa I have yet to stop bleeding, I started the first day of my period had my regular period for my usual 7 days and have had continued spotting heavily everyday since.
36	174	I haven't gained weight or had any spotting, but I have noticed I get more sensitive late in the 3rd week of the pills and the moodiness just gets worse during my period.
36	175	I was having a lot of problems with spotting so my doctor put me on Trinessa and it was terrible.
36	176	Each month like clockwork after finishing the second week of pills I would have spotting that would last until I took my last pill and then its period time, so basically had a period for two weeks.
36	177	I hope that helps me as I've been dealing with spotting issues for almost a year and have been on probably 4 different pills and nothing has helped.
36	178	The first few months I was on the pill, I had some spotting but after 3 months or so that stopped.
36	179	I went to the doctor and she switched me to LoSeasonique BUT I'm going to get off of that because I have been spotting pretty bad and I still can't get over the fact of not having a period except for 4 times per year, seems very unnatural.
36	180	Also, if I forgot to take a pill and took 2 the next day I would always get spotting.
36	181	One week I missed the first 3 pills and still didn't get any spotting.
36	182	I spot between periods.
36	183	The only thing (which is minor to me) is that I sometimes spot a tiny bit in between periods but not every month.
36	184	I like that my periods on 2 or 3 days, but I spot everyday half way through the pack.
36	185	I only have to use a "regular" size tampon for 4 days but then I will usually spot for 3-4 more days, in which I'll just use a panty liner.
36	186	The only thing is when I first started taking it, I spotted for a month, which is normal.
36	187	I spotted (or straight up just bled) for the entire first pack.
36	188	I also spotted throughout the first month of taking it.
36	189	Other than the low drive I don't really have any problems with it, but if I forget to take it I will get a headache until I take it.
36	190	I had one minor headache when I first began taking this medicine but have not had one since.
36	191	I had slight nausea the first night of taking the pill and a headache the next day but otherwise, no side effects.
36	192	The first couple of days, I experienced a tiny headache.
36	193	I would feel like I was in a dream with fever, no energy, headache, and cry for hours for no reason.
36	194	I changed because my other one was giving me extreme headaches when I went to the sugar pill.
36	195	First two weeks I had horrible headaches which would turn into migraines.
36	196	The only drawback is that in the first 2-3 months or so I would get dizzy, slight headaches, and a little more fatigued than usual.
36	197	I have headaches around my period.
36	198	After the birth of my child in December I tried the shot and it was the worst ever...I lost tons of hair and constantly bled almost the whole 3 months, mood swings, and the list goes on...Well first week of Trinessa I did get some headaches and a bit of nausea but nothing I couldn't tolerate.
36	199	I constantly get headaches, anxiety, nervousness, nausea, emotional as heck  and did I mention the mood swings!!?
36	200	I also have headaches, muscle and breast soreness.
36	201	I don't get headaches from it and no abnormal bleeding.
36	202	In the first couple weeks I experienced terrible headaches but they started to subside later.
36	203	However, I've gained weight, had daily headaches, and I've felt extremely dizzy after taking it for 4 months.
36	204	The first few months I had extreme nausea (almost to the point of throwing up - but never did), headaches and slight weight gain(3-4lbs).
36	205	I gained weight, was expected and had terrible headaches don't go away for hours.
36	206	The first week upon taking it, I had severe abdominal pain and headaches.
36	207	I've had no headaches, weight gain, my skin has cleared up a lot since starting it.
36	208	I started taking the pill for my irregular cycle and it has worked but I've noticed I started having headaches, bloating and terrible mood swings.
36	209	Over 2 months...I've gained 10lbs, awful mood swings, headaches (which I never used to get) and fatigue.
36	210	I have short periods but mild headaches and mood swings.
36	211	I have had a little weight gain and sometimes slight headaches.
36	212	I had regular five day periods, no headaches, no nausea, no weight gain, and (thankfully) no mood swings.
36	213	Then I slowly started to notice I would get hot and headaches out of nowhere.
36	214	No nausea, headaches or any other crazy things.
36	215	NO headaches, I've lost weight because  with Ortho I was bloated a lot.
36	216	I felt horrible (uncontrollable nausea, headaches, crazy mood changes, dry mouth) during the first month but I decided to stick with it since the side effects were "normal".
36	217	At first I had a lot of symptoms headaches, nausea, etc.
36	218	The headaches were too much for me.
36	219	I had intense headaches everyday within an hour of taking this medicine, and I was very emotional.
36	220	I was dizzy and exhausted with intense headaches despite getting plenty of rest.
36	221	I don't have mood swings or headaches because of it.
36	222	Yes, I only use this for birth control and has done it's job well (no kids), but I have gotten horrible headaches.
36	223	This pill has been great with no migraines or weight gain.
36	224	Nausea, migraines, upset stomach.
36	225	I also woke up with a swollen face, experienced migraines that kept on knocking me down.
36	226	It gave me terrible migraines a few hours after I took it every single day.
36	227	I get terrible migraines due to irregular period and they get so bad I end up at the ER so my Doctor put me back on trinessa.
36	228	But those side affects are a lot better than migraines which are not even bearable.
36	229	It also increased my migraines and made them much worse.
36	230	The first 1.5 weeks of the pill pack are the worst, I cant eat or sleep, and the migraines are awful.
36	231	I have always suffered from migraines and they have been controlled but within the last week they have been awful.
36	232	It helped with my migraines and cleared up my skin.
36	233	Close to week 3 I have a series of migraines.
36	234	I just started taking TriNessa, So far I have horrible nausea and terrible migraines.
36	235	Before Trinessa, I was on Orth-tri-cyclen lo and I had bad migraines.
36	236	It hasn’t really affected my sex drive but I either can’t get wet right away or I’m too wet.
36	237	I have taken Yasmine and the patch before and had to stop at 2 weeks because I immediately started experiencing side effects such as weight gain, nausea, vomiting, depression, decreased sex drive.
36	238	Bloating, nauseous, breast growth, drained sex drive from  8/10 to a 1/10.
36	239	Still have about no sex drive.
36	240	I've had a severe decrease in my sex drive to the point where I usually don't even want to masturbate but it's kind of coming back 5 months later.
36	241	I have completely lost my sex drive.
36	242	okay well ever since I have started this bcp I have noticed a decrease in my sex drive and i have lost my appetite.
36	243	But tbh I don't see the point in a bcp if you don't even have a sex drive anymore.
36	244	My sex drive has drastically decreased.
36	245	The only complaint I have is lower sex drive, but there are ways around that!
36	246	This pill STILL kindly provides me with constant bloating for about two weeks out of a pack, an obliterated sex drive and life with my fianc
36	247	The sex drive wasn't hugely affected until the end of my use of trinessa but it was a very intense drop off.
36	248	I used to be very into sex, but once I was on it for a few weeks, my sex drive completely went away.
36	249	I did experience increased discharge, extreme lack of sex drive, and extreme fatigue.
36	250	Sex drive has decreased slightly but nothing detrimental.
36	251	Every single one of them left me moody, depressed, and my sex drive was completely non existent.
36	252	Worst symptom: complete destruction of my sex drive.
36	253	No sex drive what so ever.
36	254	The only side effect I experienced was a low sex drive.
36	255	Sex drive is through the roof which my boyfriend loves!
36	256	But I have noticed my sex drive is way lower.
36	257	Every little thing annoys me and I have no sex drive AT ALL.
36	258	While being on trinessa I noticed more a lot of mood swings and changes in my libido, all which started when I started on the pill.
36	259	I also completely lost my libido.
36	260	Decreased libido is the other negative side effect that I am experiencing as well.
36	261	I am no longer on TriNessa because of the lack of libido (I was on it purely for contraceptive purposes).
36	262	I have experience NO weight gain.
36	263	Weight gain all due to TriNessa.
36	264	It helped my periods, my breakouts, and caused me NO weight gain!!
36	265	No pain, no weight gain, no any side effect.
36	266	My face has been clearing up, I haven't noticed any weight gain and haven't noticed any major changes in my mood.
36	267	I haven't experienced weight gain, my boobs do feel a little bigger though.
36	268	2 wks before my period is due, my face flushed, broke out in worst rosacea, skin scaled, then pimpled, now that my skin is going getting better, my breast enlarged about 5 pds more, overall body weight gain about 5 pds more mid body, waist, I've felt bloated about half month.
36	269	I've been on trinessa for a year now I've never experienced any weight gain or nausea also it's done a good job preventing pregnancy for me.
36	270	Slight weight gain.
36	271	I had problems with weight gain before I started taking it and it has caused me to lose weight and if I don't eat enough I will just keep losing a ton of weight.
36	272	Overall, I haven't had any other side effects, apart from weight gain.
36	273	I am stopping the pill due to a 10 pound, in three month, weight gain.
36	274	I have had weight gain, which I love.
36	275	No weight gain and my period was on point!
36	276	Then after about a month I noticed a five pound weight gain (I am a soldier in the US military so I work out five days a week and nothing else could have caused this) which, by the time the prescription had ran out had ballooned up to almost fifteen pounds!
36	277	No weight gain but I do have one terrible evening of nausea once a month during the week before the placebo pills.
36	278	I haven't experienced any weight gain.
36	279	Not intended weight gain, and periods seemed to turn out normal and right on time every month.
36	280	You can keep weight gain under control if you exercise when you're taking it since a lot of it is water weight.
36	281	I also experienced slight weight gain but nothing major.
36	282	Ortho Novum 777 made my hair fall out, mood swings and weight gain.
36	283	I was scared at first because of the bad reviews sucha s weight gain and depression.
36	284	It works great and there are no painful side effects or weight gain or anything of that matter.
36	285	I have never had weight gain nausea or vomiting even in the beginning.
36	286	When I first started the only side effect I had was a little bit of weight gain (3-4lbs).
36	287	Weight gain is a myth.
36	288	So far I have had breast tenderness, fatigue, weight gain, 104lb to 127lb (yes huge difference,) lower abdomen pain.
36	289	My only side effect has been weight gain, which no woman will be happy with..along with moodiness during my period but thats pretty typical.
36	290	I have actually experienced less mood swings than when on OTC, however I have noticed more bloating (no weight gain) and some new bumps on my face.
36	291	I haven't had weight gain or any other side effect.
36	292	I have not noticed any negative effects, no excessive weight gain, or mood swings.
36	293	I have horrible mood swings, nausea, depression, tired more, slight weight gain, thinning of my hair (used to have nice thick hair and now it is thin) and if I miss a day and take two together I get really sick.
36	294	I also gained about 15 pounds.
36	295	I haven't gained any weight (but I am a college athlete so I do exercise quite a bit).
36	296	I've been on Trinessa for about a year now my doctor prescribed it for me since I hadn't had my period for a year because I was on the depo shot and gained so much weight from the shot!
36	297	I've gained 12 pounds since I've started, and I'm a petite girl who's weight never fluctuates.
36	298	In the year I have been on the pill, I have gained about 15 pounds and my diet is very healthy and I'm active.
36	299	I gained about 5 pounds but have also slipped on my healthy eating/ working out so that could also be why.
36	300	I also gained 10 pounds that I am working my ass off to lose and its nearly been impossible to lose the weight.
36	301	Ever since I've been taking it I've noticed I have less energy, I'm incredibly irritable, and I've gained weight even though I've been working out and watching my food intake.
36	302	Trinessa makes me bloated, irritable, depressed, sore swollen breasts, I cry a lot and I've gained 20  lbs!!!!
36	303	I haven't gained any weight or broke out at all.
36	304	I gained 20lbs from it.
36	305	At first, I was an extreme bitch and super emotional for about the first month or two and my breasts increased and I probably gained about 5 pounds.
36	306	I have not gained or lost any weight on the pill and still have the same appetite.
36	307	I always felt bloated and gained 5 pounds the first week, and another 8 pounds over the next couple months, The weight was IMPOSSIBLE to lose, and as someone who has struggled with eating disorders it was extremely disheartening.
36	308	In the short time I've been on it i have gained 15 POUNDS!!!!
36	309	The only cons are that I gained about 5 pounds which isn't so bad all birth control does this but I am also tiny for my age (105 pounds) and I was also a bit moody.
36	310	But I gained a LOT of weight (I was usually 109-115 and now I'm 135-140), mostly in my thighs and lower abdomen that would not go away.
36	311	I am way more moody (weepy/short fuse), I've gained 5-7 lbs.
36	312	In addition, I've become somewhat lazy and gained a tad bit of weight.
36	313	Its cleared my skin so much, I haven't gained any weight at all, and most importantly the periods are shorter.
36	314	I have gained about 5 lbs and I am bloated.
36	315	I have not gained any weight from it.
36	316	I have not gained weight.
36	317	Unlike other birth controls the most weight I gained since I started it is 2 pounds.
36	318	It does not cause me to be moody, I've never gained weight from this pill and I've never had any pregnancy scares on this pill.
36	319	I have gained very little weight and my skin was mostly clear even right before I was about to start my period.
36	320	I constantly feel bloated and have gained weight.
36	321	I thought I had gained 10 pounds.
36	322	I get nausea EVERY morning to the point I want to throw up.
36	323	During the 1st week I vomited and experienced severe nausea.
36	324	Although the vomiting subsided, I continued to experience nausea through the 2nd week.
36	325	By the 2nd month, I noticed an increase in weight (5-10lbs), larger breasts, mood swings, and nausea returned on/off for the 1st week.
36	326	Although it lessened this symptom somewhat, I have had insane mood swings, depression, and nausea.
36	327	The first couple weeks I had slight nausea and mood swings, nothing crazy, probably my body getting used to it.
36	328	So far I am only feeling very mild nausea.
36	329	Soon as I stopped taking it the nausea went away and the stomach pains.
36	330	I take the pill at night and for the first week it gives me bad nausea.
36	331	Although I experienced some horrible nausea during the first 2 months, I've always been susceptible to nausea when starting a new brand of bcp, so I know to wait at least 3 months for your body to stablize.
36	332	No more nausea, no more mood swings - just crazy clear skin and babyless womb.
36	333	I haven't had any nausea.
36	334	The only complaint I have is the slight nausea every now and then along with feeling fatigued, I assume this should go away the more I use it so right now it's a waiting game.
36	335	Bad nausea, depression, anxiety, swollen face, and INSANE mood swings.
36	336	The nausea has gone away the second month.
36	337	I felt extremely uncomfortable due to the bloating constantly and nausea began to settle in as well.
36	338	I was at a concert and had to sit down because the nausea was so bad.
36	339	Then there's also the nausea.
36	340	Slight nausea at the start of taking this pill but went away quickly.
36	341	From about August-February I was overcome by nausea and vomiting.
36	342	It also made the nausea I get during my periods much worse.
36	343	Since taking it, I have constantly felt like I got a lump in my throat and my diaphragm area and decreased my appetite, so I'd put that in the nausea category.
36	344	It does the job with little side effects: nausea and diarrhea.
36	345	From the start I have had nausea so bad it wakes me up in the middle of the night for the first few pills of the pack.
36	346	I do have mild nausea at the beginning of the cycle if I don't eat much but other than that it works pretty well.
36	347	I just started this last week and I've had the worst nausea in the world ,can't even sleep I take it at night and wake up feeling really unwell .
36	348	I stopped taking this pill one month ago because it began to make me feel nausea throughout the day and I began to feel emotional from it as well.
36	349	Still regular cycle, overall I do like it besides the nausea.
36	350	I started this pill when I was 18, and I experienced extreme nausea the first two weeks (as is expected when you've never taken another bcp before).
36	351	It gave me extreme nausea to the point where I didn't even want to see or smell food.
36	352	I started back on the pills again and the first day I experienced extreme nausea and vomited.
36	353	The nausea has continued to follow me for the past weeks, now I am looking into the Nuvaring.
36	354	It left a terrible taste in my mouth and made me gain weight, had even worse nausea and worst of all I acted like a monster!
36	355	I missed about three pills one month and it caused severe nausea.
36	356	The nausea wouldn't stop even after months of taking my pills regularly.
36	357	My doctor had to prescribe me with anti nausea medication just so I could make it through the day.
36	358	Month 2-4 were better; barely any nausea, only slight mood changes, regular light period.
36	359	I took it at night so the nausea would always keep me up.
36	360	You may get nausea.
36	361	However, when I first started on the pill I would get this strange really subtle nausea.
36	362	I also have bouts of nausea sometimes around my period, but nothing I can't handle.
36	363	And the nausea and throwing up is aggravating itself.
36	364	I have HORRIBLE anxiety, depression, mood swings, nausea, mental confusion (this is the worst, I cannot focus, concentrate, and my memory is very poor) and I am very irritable.
36	365	Its hard for me to eat or ride in a car because of nausea.
36	366	I'm on Ocella now and I've never missed one, so I don't know if it's that I'm sensitive to nausea with doubling up, or if it was the Trinessa.
36	367	Then the 2nd day we went to the water park and I was attacked by a horrible bout of nausea.
36	368	I couldn't handle the nausea and ongoing sickness.
36	369	I switched to Tri-Sprintec and experienced extreme nausea, although the pharmacist insisted it was the exact same medications, just different manufacturers.
36	370	I have been on this pill for about a week now and increasingly over the past 5 days I have been nauseated at night and SEVERELY depressed and I mean severely.
36	371	I also noticed I get really nauseated at night.
36	372	Immediately after the first pill I became nauseated.
36	373	I'm nauseated all the time even with a meal, even changed times to see if that would help.
36	374	Every day there's a point to where I'm very nauseated.
36	375	I've been on Trinessa for 2 months now and I seem to be nauseated all the time!
36	376	I would wake up nauseous a few morning out of the week, some times I would vomit because of it.
36	377	I was on this birth control for 8 months before I realized that it was causing my  panic attacks and paranoia.I lost my appetite, felt nauseous all the time.
36	378	I take it at 7pm every night because I did feel slightly nauseous when I took it in the morning when I first started taking trinessa.
36	379	Make sure that you eat before or immediately after taking the pill, otherwise you will feel nauseous.
36	380	At first it made me nauseous everyday but just in the mornings.
36	381	TriNessa is effective in the sense that it has prevented unwanted pregnancy, however, for the last four months I have been on this medication, I have been feeling bloated and nauseous every single day.
36	382	However, ever since I started I have been so anxious that, at one point, I was border-line anorexic from being nauseous with no appetite, I've had severe sleep disorders that have stemmed from the anxiety and depression, and I've had serious thoughts of suicide on multiple occasions.
36	383	I am nauseous all day and it affects my mood shortly after taking it, I go from happy and productive to moody and sluggish.
36	384	I was not expecting for it to start working to stop my elongated period immediately but the all day nauseous and mood change is the worst, I will try to complete the month but I not sure if the is the option for me.
36	385	Downside I'm on like month 6 and I'm nauseous almost every time I take my pill sometimes even after I take it on a full stomach.
36	386	The very first day I took it I felt horribly nauseous but thankfully it went away and hasn't come back since.
36	387	I was given a 90 day supply, and the first few days of taking it I was constantly nauseous.
36	388	I'm always nauseous, dizzy, tired, achy, and depressed.
36	389	It didn't make me nauseous or vomit.
36	390	It was prom and I got extremely nauseous and threw up twice!
36	391	I was so emotional and constantly nauseous.
36	392	I was very hesitant to try any birth control before because I'm very sensitive and I have tried some other ones before and I cannot even last  over a week and I would get very sick like dizzy & the hot flashes.
36	393	My breasts have gotten bigger and the best part is no bad mood swings or depression, which is what I was the most scared of.
36	394	I cried all the time I had panic attacks and mood swings multiple times a day.
36	395	The main reason I will be switching is because of my horrible mood swings.
36	396	I've gotten extreme head aches and mood swings.
36	397	I sometimes have mood swings, getting sad randomly but that's about it.
36	398	Crying constantly, overthinking, irritable, mood swings, anxious to no end.
36	399	I think the mood swings and emotional distress others are mentioning would happen with or without any BCP because of PMS.
36	400	The first 5 days I had awful mood swings and barely had an appetite for anything.
36	401	I have terrible mood swings.
36	402	Within the first month my mood swings were gone, noticed hair growth and reduction in hair loss, first period was only 4 days and not too heavy but maybe 2nd day only.
36	403	But my mood swings were bad!
36	404	My only complaint on this is I have TERRIBLE mood swings with this medicine and it has worsened my already present anxiety and depression.
36	405	Although the mood swings I get from this birth control has pretty much ruined my relationship.
36	406	I had dramatic mood swings it was incredible- I spoke to my dr to which she recommend the trinessa and I've been on it since.
36	407	I Haven't Had Any Nausea , Mood Swings ?
36	408	I've had no bad experience with trinessa I do have slight mood swings here and there but Nothing too extreme.
36	409	I've had unbelievable mood swings since the start.
36	410	No crazy mood swings either!
36	411	The first two months I had mood swings, which is to be expected when putting hormones into yourself.
36	412	My mood swings was very bad, I had slight depression, emotional problems, I just got married and I didn't want my husband to touch me, and vaginal discharge all the time is was grossing me out!
36	413	After roughly a month I started having horrible mood swings.
36	414	I have terrible mood swings and am usually completely incapacitated every first day of my period.
36	415	No vomiting for me or irregular mood swings.
36	416	Like every other birth control it has cons, the mood swings and the bloating are pretty much the only ones I've experienced.
36	417	I have no mood swings and don't get hungry like crazy.
36	418	Headaches, mood swings not so much but I do cry a lot and I mean a lot.
36	419	Mild mood swings, but nothing I can't handle.
36	420	My only complaint is my constant mood swings, which changes in a second.
36	421	I haven't had any mood swings either.
36	422	Especially about the mood swings and what not because my boyfriend and I were already having problems with me freaking out about the tiniest things.
36	423	After about a week of being on it my mood swings got a little bit worse and I would cry about anything, but it went away quickly and I mean they WENT AWAY.
36	424	The worst side effect of all though has to be the mood swings.
36	425	My mood swings were off the charts.
36	426	I don't think a day had gone by for me without crying and/or having intense mood swings.
36	427	I experienced heavier and longer periods while on it and mood swings sometimes (could just be the norm for a 25 year old female though!).
36	428	Within the first couple of months I started experiencing mood changes and random panic attacks.
36	429	This was my first time trying out birth control, and after reading all the reviews I was very nervous.
36	430	Each time I was going to try something new (Trinessa, Nuvaring, and now Ocella) I was really nervous because of the reviews.
36	431	However, I have been severely depressed and anxious.
36	432	I also felt more anxious depressed after beginning it and even had to start taking anti depressants because of it.
36	433	I'm definitely moody, irritable and anxious.
36	434	From having serious depression to anxiety about everything.
36	435	I have put on at least 20 pounds and still have depression and anxiety.
36	436	I am a very emotional person and prone to anxiety attacks, and it never made it worse!
36	437	My depression and anxiety are MUCH better than when I wasn't using BC.
36	438	I suffer from anxiety and depression.
36	439	TriNessa made my anxiety and depression so much worse.
36	440	I've never had a panic or anxiety attack before and every month I've been having terrible panic attacks.
36	441	HOWEVER, this past week, I got my first ever panic attack and anxiety which I've never felt before and it's horrible.
36	442	For anyone who has any trouble with anxiety or depression, I HIGHLY suggest you do not try this birth control.
36	443	However, ever since I've been taking it, my anxiety has reached a whole new level.
36	444	It has affected a lot of my close relationships, such as my boyfriend who is constantly having to put up my depression and anxiety attacks.
36	445	I sleep great, my anxiety is actually better.
36	446	and I have anxiety, that went up so much ever since I've being taking Trinessa.
36	447	I never realized it that it was because of TriNessa due to the fact that I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for 7 years now.
36	448	DO NOT take TriNessa if you have a history of anxiety or depression!!
36	449	Prior to the switch i was recovering from anxiety and depression triggered by grad school.
36	450	I was crawling out of my skin with anxiety.
36	451	I'm 3 weeks in on Trinessa after being on Trisprintec for 5 years (ran out of refills and was put on Trinessa before Doctor could get me in) I have expirenced terrible anxiety and thoughts of depression.
36	452	I am struggling with anxiety and random panic attacks and constantly feel depressed.
36	453	I even started seeing a therapist for the anxiety attacks.
36	454	My mood issues started out as mild, but have now blown into nonstop anxiety, depression, anger and irritability.
36	455	Major breast tenderness, my PMS starts about 2 weeks early.
36	456	Breast tenderness isn't as bad but they swell three weeks into a pack.
36	457	I haven't had any negative side effects except for sore breasts but it's not even bad.
36	458	The ONLY thing I hate about it is the fact that my breasts hurt all the time.
36	459	I've gotten use to the bloating, but the vaginal discharge is annoying and frustrating because I kept thinking it was a yeast infection or something like that and everything I've taken to try to get rid of it has not worked and it was driving me crazy, but after reading some of the reviews for Trinessa, I realized it must be one of the side effects of the pill because it started when I started taking it.
36	460	I went to my doctor and they treated it as a yeast infection but nothing helped.
37	1	My acne has gotten a little worse but not bad.
37	2	My period has always been 7 days so it didn't fix my long abnormal period but it did fix my acne and it did not effect my mood.
37	3	I have had acne since I was 12 but now I get maybe one pimple when I'm on my off week.
37	4	I haven't experienced an acne blemish which was common to occur during my period.
37	5	I mainly took it because my health condition caused me to have acne all the time, 2 periods a month, & I started growing facial hair rapidly.
37	6	I tried this and at first it was pretty cool, my hair stopped growing so fast, my periods were predictable, my acne was gone, and my small boobs grew.
37	7	I already had a slight acne problem, it didn't improve it.
37	8	I have noticed that my breasts grew rounder and fuller, no acne, no vaginal dryness, predictable periods, light periods, low cramping and best of all, no unplanned children!
37	9	This does help control acne as well, and have not experienced any weight gain and I have used it for over a year and a half.
37	10	I also developed gross acne.
37	11	My acne is clearing up and my vaginal stays very very wet.
37	12	I still get acne during that time of month but I've always been like that so I don't blame the patch.
37	13	I got no acne on this and it made my boobs grow a full cup size no lie the only thing I didn't like was I kept getting scared that it would fall off but what i do is when i switch it i put the new one on where the old one was so its extra sticky (don't do this if your skin gets irritated or red) but yeah I'm switching back cause i miss it and no pill i've tried made my skin as clear as xulane does lol!
37	14	Xulane patch worked well for me, cleared up my acne very quickly, but fell off very easily.
37	15	I tried xulane, pros helps with acne & you only have to worry about it once a week.
37	16	As soon as I got on Xulane the acne stopped within 3 weeks.
37	17	At age 30, I started having cystic acne for the first time in my life.
37	18	My boobs have grown a half size bigger and my acne cleared up.
37	19	My dermatologist and I were both surprised with how much acne it gave me.
37	20	On the bright side, I'm not pregnant, though I'm not sexual active, and my acne has cleared up a lot.
37	21	I have bloating, constipation, headaches, tiredness, tender breasts, terrible mood swings/depression, acne, and I'm constantly craving sweets!
37	22	While I was on OrthoEva my skin was clear and I loved it but now I have more acne & I get white heads which are difficult to get rid of.
37	23	The only thing I've noticed is that I get tiny pimples UNDER the patch when I've taken it off, which is very minor.
37	24	I have dysmenorrhea, and it has really helped my terrible cramps.
37	25	I don't have any side effects, other than at week 3, I always get cramps.
37	26	I still don't understand why I get cramps before my period, but I have always had issues with other birth controls when it came to spotting and not being strong enough for me.
37	27	Been on xulane for 7 months, most of the time I'm chill, no mood swings, periods are lighter, I used to have awful cramps now I only have minimal cramping on the first day of my period.
37	28	The first week got nausea and cramps .
37	29	I have also experienced nausea, cramps, mood swings and a headache that was so bad I threw up.
37	30	I never had bad cramps I had them but they wasn't terrible, they were ok.
37	31	When I started the patch my cramps got so bad I would cry myself to sleep I get back pains and a lot more than now when I'm cramping.
37	32	Leg still feels funny but I have no other symptoms other than that since; but I was very tired, getting cramps, and would get hot flashes on and off.
37	33	Before Xulane, I would get debilitating vomiting during my period but cramps were scarce.
37	34	Now that I'm on Xulane, I haven't thrown up at all and headaches are scarce but cramps have been made so much worse.
37	35	I've been on the patch for months now at first there was stomach pain and nausea which I still have some times but now there weight gain , I'm fatigue 24/7 and my menstrual cramps are 10000× worst then they were before.
37	36	My period is drastically lighter and I don't get ill or experience extreme cramps.
37	37	I didn't have pain or cramps before trying BC.
37	38	This has not stopped and today I'm missing school because of that and the gnarly cramps I'm also experiencing.
37	39	I must admit that it did shorten my period and I don't really get cramps anymore.
37	40	This is horrible i never used to get cramps and BAM they came i was vomiting I couldn't get up they were terrible!
37	41	I recently switched to Skyla and I am having horrible cramps with it.
37	42	I never got cramps before the patch; now they're so bad I can barely move for the first 2 days of my period.
37	43	My libido is back up, cramps gone, not to mention perky breasts!
37	44	Not having a period would be nice and all, but I still experience PMS, mood swings, and extremely bad cramps; yet not bleeding at all.
37	45	I was on the patch for almost 6 six months and it at first it helped but after the second period it didn't work I got really bad cramps I was bledding heavy like I did before followed by every other period after that.
37	46	More recently, the cramps have become debilitating and I have them 2-3 weeks a month.
37	47	I'd never gotten a yeast infection & never got cramps & that all continued to not happen.
37	48	The cramps were so bad!
37	49	The only side effects I've experienced with both types of patches is cramps.
37	50	I didn't get cramps with my period until I began using the patches.
37	51	my periods have also gotten heavier and my cramps worse than when I first started.
37	52	The constant gas/bloating, heavy periods with cramps that last over a week, constant hunger/weight gain, and the mood swings.
37	53	It has stuck very well to the arms, I'll also mention that I got pretty bad cramps before my period, not sure if that was a side effect but they were worse than normal
37	54	I got on the patch and I never thought I'd say my period is pleasant but I call it "cute and petite" no cramps.
37	55	This third month, I've had unbelievable cramps that no medicine will relieve and incredible nausea.
37	56	And as for my period its done wonders I always had short periods (about 3 days) but it was heavy and the cramps and the worst  thing was nothing would help them either.
37	57	Long story short  I had really bad cramps, dizzy, headaches, and a 6 week long period..while on the birth control which is supposed to stop it for 3 weeks at a time...
37	58	It cleared up my skin significantly, made my periods shorter and lighter, and helped with cramps.
37	59	The first month was fine, no side effects, irritation or pregnancy scares or anything but then the second month I started experiencing nausea, cramps, my period was late and then I had the absolute worst depression and even started losing touch with reality.
37	60	Also, this could be because I had switched from an extended cycle pill, but I have cramps straight from the lowest pits of Mordor the week before my period.
37	61	I have the chills, cramps, headache, nausea and vomiting.
37	62	If you are someone who goes to school, is forgetful, or just barely has time in the day to remember to eat this helps you avoid the spotting, the cramps, the possible pregnancy of being on the pill and forgetting to take it.
37	63	Before I started my periods were bad with headaches, cramping, and heavy flow, after the first month my periods dwindled and now I only need light pads, I rarely cramp and have maybe one headache.
37	64	period is now light and pretty much cramp free, i barely notice.
37	65	Had no problems other than very little cramping here and there.
37	66	I also noticed cramping, and never felt secure that my birth control was effective.
37	67	2nd week less nausea more cramping .
37	68	The past month I've had issues with spotting and cramping like on my period which I've never experienced before while using Xulane.
37	69	Put this on yesterday at 12:00pm on the right side of my hips, and my right leg subsequently felt funny ever since - like it was heavy and cramping, but I had chalked it up to my anxiety disorder playing tricks on me.
37	70	Increase is sex drive, no vaginal dryness, and light periods - no cramping.
37	71	The first few months included cramping, nausea, and terrible migraines after removing the patch for my patch free week.
37	72	The patch never itched, came off, caused cramping.
37	73	I experience nausea, headaches, and severe cramping during times of suspected ovulation.
37	74	I couldn't do anything for the first day because moving made the cramping stonger.
37	75	I was using ortho evra for 11 years and I absolutely loved it, I had no complications at all, when it was discontinued my doctor prescribed xulane, the first month was fine then I the following month I bled for 2 months straight with ache, pain, fatigue and severe cramping.
37	76	I never had cramping or any problem prior to taking this contraceptive.
37	77	Every week when I apply the patch I started spotting and become fatigue with cramping, after about 8 month I applied it and there was no spotting so I thought finally it started working, well I couldn't be more wrong.
37	78	Previously used oral BC methods, all of which gave me irregular cycles, harsh cramping, etc.
37	79	My periods are heavy & have painful cramping, some in between bleeding
37	80	Ever since I started the patch my periods aren't as heavy and I have little to no cramping
37	81	This works great for me, periods are regular, light, little to no cramping and no pregnancy.
37	82	My periods were consistent while I was on Ortho, but when I switched to Xulane they became very spotty/unpredictable, not to mention the bloating and cramping I felt.I was on my 3rd month before I realized I was pregnant.
37	83	However, I get nauseous sometimes and a little crampy before my period.
37	84	No spotting in between.
37	85	On Monday of wk 3 I started spotting (20days post last period) and it was consisted at every use of the bathroom.
37	86	On top of that, I'm getting two periods - very heavy "spotting" a week before it's supposed to come and then another period the week I'm off the patch.
37	87	I was spotting for a whole week, which was expected.
37	88	I've had a little spotting after my period.
37	89	Now I am on my 5th month using and still have spotting in between my period.
37	90	My doctors decided to switch me over to the birth control pills that didn't help , so I decided to get on the patch within 3 days my bleeding and spotting ended , yeah I experience some side effects such as back pain and nausea but it doesn't last a long time and it's bearable .
37	91	It took about 4 months for my period to be normal, because I would have spotting in between.
37	92	Its been only 2 months and I already have spotting issues on weeks I'm not supposed to bleed.
37	93	I do spot during periods and bleed after sex.
37	94	My period is shorter and lighter but I still spot a few times which was expected.
37	95	This seems to be the best spot, except when I get asked what it is.
37	96	I use the xulane patch too my first time on bc and yes it does leaves rashes and itch the only thing I can think of now is to not put it in the same spot as last time.
37	97	I also experienced spot periods while on the patch.
37	98	After using pills and the the shot this I'd the best one by far, I've never had a regular period and after having twins I would get my period twice a month and spot in between.
37	99	I spotted the entire year!
37	100	Only spotted one day.
37	101	I put the first patch on and that night I had vomiting, severe headache - not good.
37	102	Sometimes I used to have bad headache a lot when I got on the patch.
37	103	I was on xulane for over a year, when I first started the patch I felt nauseous  and had a headache the first 3-5 days.
37	104	I noticed my breast are more full and perkier which is nice but I did notice I am more emotional on the patch and a headache here and there.
37	105	Just started for the first time yesterday my first day and woke up this morning feeling nauseous and major headache !!!!!
37	106	During my first three days, my appetite was demolished, mainly because any and everything I consumed made me nauseous and I also had a pounding headache.
37	107	I was expecting headaches, nausea, a lot of issues to be honest as I suffer almost daily with chronic headaches.
37	108	I actually feel happier on this patch, my headaches have actually improved, I seem to have more energy too.
37	109	I love it, only thing that's annoying is the occasional headaches and nausea.
37	110	I’ve just started using the patch and other then getting some very minor headaches it’s been great!!
37	111	I started getting headaches on left side of my head.
37	112	I finally took it off a week ago and my headaches are less.
37	113	My headaches got worse to the point I didn't want to open my eyes.
37	114	I had a few headaches here and there that I barely noticed while I started it.
37	115	I got headaches about two hours after putting my first one in, as well as dizziness and nausea, but I told myself to push through and the side effects would subside.
37	116	It was heavy and I would often get headaches.
37	117	I have had terrible headaches, arm and stomach pain, and nausea.
37	118	I've never had headaches in my life but had constant terrible headaches on the patch and awful mood swings.
37	119	When the second month started it was going well until I applied the second patch, I had terrible headaches, nausea, extremely light headed, and the worst part extreme stomach pains .
37	120	I applied the first patch of the third month this Monday that just passed and the extreme stomach pain returned along with vomiting & headaches.
37	121	I have been on the patch for about 3 months now, I used to have severe headaches every day before starting Xulane.
37	122	Not only that, but I have been having headaches, which I never had prior to taking this patch.
37	123	The first couple months I experienced emotions going haywire, minor headaches and one period that I thought I was going to die or just felt like dying because it was horrifically pain.
37	124	I do notice mild headaches during days (1-2 times per week).
37	125	Now I know why I had so many headaches.
37	126	I have terrible gastrointestinal problems, feel sore and tender, dizzy, have headaches and the worst part is the nausea.
37	127	I have not had migraines or even mild headaches.
37	128	I'm starting to get headaches and nausea which I have never experienced before.
37	129	I am starting to get headaches for the past month.
37	130	There are constant headaches and what look like signs of early pregnancy, but after a while it works perfect!
37	131	I do get headaches the first day I put on my new patch so i just take Advil as a preventive and that seems to do the job.. most of the time.
37	132	I switched from the Nexplanon implant simply because I heard of a recall on it and I couldn't take the constant dizziness and headaches .I used orthro evra before and it was lovely but, this isn't at all.
37	133	Then after a few months I would get bad headaches, double vision, dizziness and even disgusting skin rashes at the patch site once summer rolled around.
37	134	As for the rest of the detials, I had no issues with headaches, nausea, or breast tenderness.
37	135	Have been on the patch for 5 months now & it's just awful, I feel nauseous all the time & get headaches and the dizziness that comes along with it.
37	136	I  was nauseated the entire time on it followed by the worst headaches of my life.
37	137	The headaches seem to always come on the day I put on a new patch, again nothing unbearable.
37	138	I first started taking pills, but I had to stop since the headaches were horrific!
37	139	I've suffered random headaches,  extreme depression and anxiety.
37	140	I couldn't sleep while on the patch due to really bad headaches.
37	141	I can honestly say while on the patch during the 1st month,  I'd experienced excruciating headaches and itching sensation when I'd placed patch on the abdomen area so I begin to change areas each week.
37	142	This month (starts 3rd patch tomorrow), very little headaches and irritation.
37	143	I had every side effect you could think of.. mood swings, depression, nausea, vomiting, stomach aches, chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches, tingling in my feet and hands, aching in my arms and legs... it got to the point where I was so concerned I had to go to the emergency room to make sure I didn't have any blood clots and that I wasn't in danger of having a stroke or heart attack.
37	144	Unlike Nuvaring, my libido hasn't disappeared a month into my new regimen, I don't seem to be gaining weight, and I don't have headaches.
37	145	I do get headaches if I'm late to change or if my period goes longer but that's normal.
37	146	First week was bad because of bad headaches and nausea but that went away.
37	147	The next day I was EXTREMELY nauseous and got the worst migraine ever and even felt feverish.
37	148	I felt hung over most of the day with a migraine head, dizziness at times, still very irritable and pain starting from the application site and spreading across my low abdomen.
37	149	When it came time for my 4th week (off week) I did have a severe migraine that lasted up until I began my period, 2-3 days after removing the patch.
37	150	I SOMETIMES get bad migraines and nauseousness.
37	151	I was very nauseous, migraines was almost everyday, and loss of appetite.
37	152	Occasionally, I get super bad migraines the day after patch removal.
37	153	But I don't have irregular bleeding or migraines.
37	154	I originally loved the ortho evra patch because my regular monthly migraines disappeared.
37	155	I have had no noticeable change in moods, sex drive is normal (there seems to be a spike towards the end of the third week, but no complaints there),
37	156	The only other thing that I’ve experienced with the patch is an increase in my sex drive.
37	157	Not sure if low sex drive is attributed to the patch or not??
37	158	It does kind of kill your sex drive at first, but I feel like I'm back to normal now.
37	159	It has even increased my sex drive, because I feel so comfortable now that I have it.
37	160	Gained 30 pounds in a year, bled for 6 months straight, mood swings, pain durning sex, and no sex drive.
37	161	Started with lack of sex drive and intermittent bleeding.
37	162	Sex drive has also decreased.
37	163	Oh yeah, and NO sex drive.
37	164	I've had absurd levels of anxiety, had a decreased sex drive, and constantly feeling dry.
37	165	I liked being on this, but the one major drawback is my sex drive essentially disappeared.
37	166	I did experience some issues with vaginal dryness and low libido (which is a possible side effect for any hormonal birth control).
37	167	My main complaint is my libido does not exist anymore and sometimes I get moody, but I feel like that is normal for women.
37	168	My libido has greatly increased too.
37	169	My libido is down somewhat.
37	170	My periods got lighter, I had a moderate libido, I wasn't nauseous at all and had almost zero negative effects.
37	171	My anxiety and depression has been at an all time high, the past three days I haven't been able to keep anything down, and I've definitely experienced the low libido several others have mentioned.
37	172	Experiencing weight gain, low libido, still making me breakout often, chest pain since i've been on it, crazy hair loss.
37	173	I have the worst mood swings, low libido, I've gained 10 pounds and I get a rash around the application area.
37	174	I was worried about weight gain, stuck to my pre bc regime and still gained the weight.
37	175	I did notice some weight gain, but nothing crazy and nothing I worried myself with.
37	176	I have not experienced weight gain that I attribute to the patch.
37	177	I've had no nausea, no weight gain, and my mood seems more balanced.
37	178	I didn't experience the weight gain or hardly any negative side effects.
37	179	Severe pain (hunger pangs) that I think contribute to the weight gain, nausea and breast pain.
37	180	My breasts are also more full (plus for me, lol) but also more sensitive; minor weight gain as well
37	181	I don't experience bloating, weight gain, rashes or nausea which is good.
37	182	I think it also caused weight gain.
37	183	no more weight gain yet, my appetite seems to be normal if not less eating than before.
37	184	I had severe weight gain and depression on implanon and some moodiness and breakthrough bleeding on NuvaRing.
37	185	I have not experienced any major negative side effects except for weight gain, some skin irritation, and premature period symptoms.
37	186	Within the first 2 months on the patch, I gain gained 10 lbs.
37	187	Worst part is that even 8 months after I got off the medication I still haven't been able to lose the weight gained
37	188	I have not gained any weight.
37	189	I've always had a round butt and gained my weight there but since using xulane I've lost that curve   Has anyone else experienced this?
37	190	I gained a few pounds and my body has become more womanly and curvy.
37	191	My boobs have gotten larger and more perky, and my butt has gained weight.
37	192	i was on birth control and my obgyn switched me to the patched because I gained weight 20 lbs in a year!
37	193	Also gained 5-6 pounds so far.
37	194	I've gained roughly 15lbs, but the kicker is that I do not eat a lot.
37	195	Haven't gained any weight but I have been small my whole life.
37	196	I'm 25 and I still get my cycle and I gained a little weight not too much.
37	197	I gained 14 pounds and looked so bloated and puffy.
37	198	I immediately gained 3 pounds (within the first week), I broke out ALL over my face, I've had three large cysts on my face, it made me irritable and caused severe insomnia.
37	199	I gained about 6 pounds but for me that was helpful and went up about half a cup size but again, perfectly okay with that!
37	200	I've gained 20lbs over the past year after staying within a 5lb range for 10 years.
37	201	I've also gained some noticable wait.
37	202	On the third month of usage, I gained about 5-10 pounds.
37	203	I have gained weight, that I don't mind but I can't stop eating!
37	204	I noticed I gained 10lbs & I become very "short tempered" For a lack of a better word.
37	205	I'm 20 years old and I've definitely gained weight and my breasrs have gotten bigger since I started this medication, but I'm not too worried about those things.
37	206	The first negative side effect was the nausea.
37	207	The nausea is super annoying cause I love to eat, other than that I recommend it!
37	208	Skin is a little irritated where the patch was, the nausea was excruciating and I ended up just taking the patch off.
37	209	Placing patch on butt instead of other areas may possibly help with nausea.
37	210	Abdominal and back pain, slight nausea, mood swings, general foggy feeling in my brain.
37	211	During the first month, I did experience some pregnancy side effects (AM nausea, food/smell sensitivity, painful breasts) especially on my patch change day.
37	212	I have not experienced any nausea.
37	213	When I first starting using Xulane, i would get really bad nausea for 2 months.
37	214	I get random feelings of nausea throughout the week, but nothing a few tums can't fix.
37	215	I just switched from the Nexplanon arm implant because I had horrible side effects (lost 20lbs in 3 months, couldn't eat because of nausea, bled for 3 months straight stopped for 2 weeks then bled for 2 more months) but I've had a pretty good experience with the patch so far
37	216	The first week, I had a few battles with nausea; every little smell made me wanna throw up!
37	217	This will be my third month using the patch and the only con is the nausea, skin irritation around the area and having to reapply it because of clothes or showering.
37	218	The only off thing is that the past two nights after dinner I get very nauseated and have lots of indigestion and burping.
37	219	I had the patch on for 1 week and was extremely nauseous to the point where I couldn’t eat anything, but also felt like I was starving.
37	220	I have mood swing all the time now I feel very weak sometimes and nauseous most of the time.
37	221	The symptoms made me feel pregnant constantly vomiting always wanting to eat always nauseous couldn't really do much for a week and a few days.
37	222	Took it off today, & very nauseous.
37	223	I'm literally nauseous everyday now, I have vomit a few times.
37	224	I get very nauseous at times dizzy back ache this month I've been feeling very bloated and upset stomach, I took it off for a while because it made me very depressed, and a zombie I normally have lots of energy now I am a bumb lol.
37	225	However, I will say this: I've found that the Xulane patch makes me a bit nauseous at times, but those phases never last more than 10 mins, although those 10 minutes can be very intense.
37	226	the only bad side effect is I get nauseous at random times but once I eat I'm fine.
37	227	I started on a Monday, Tuesday morning, the 2nd day of use, I was very nauseous for just a little while & went away.
37	228	I used to use  BCP but the thought of swallowing a pill everyday yearly made me feel literally nauseous when I took it...to the point I stopped and used condoms only.
37	229	The first week I was nauseous, but that went away.
37	230	I'm nauseous all the time.
37	231	I had to leave work early today because, of how nauseous I feel.
37	232	Im currently laying down in nauseous agony.
37	233	I didn't really eat all day, I tried to eat some stuff but I started getting nauseous.
37	234	After lying on the floor in nauseous agony and reading the reviews i tore it right off.
37	235	I am so nauseous and my face has broken out badly.
37	236	So far I'm two months in and while I like it, I'm beyond nauseous.
37	237	I hate feeling nauseous and throwing up.
37	238	I put the patch on this morning and have been nauseous the entire day.
37	239	I have been on the patch for three weeks now and the first week was horrible I was very tired and nauseous and week 2 and 3 have been great and I'm sexually active and it has not affected me in any way in the area, the sex is still great.
37	240	I also started feeling dizzy and was super irritable to the point it was affecting my job.
37	241	This made me have mood swings   and i would get dizzy for hours during the day 10 out of 10That i do not recommend this is terrible
37	242	I feel extremely dizzy.
37	243	The day after I put the patch on I began having mood swings.
37	244	But the negative thing is that it causes me to be super emotional, and get really bad mood swings.
37	245	Slight itching at patch site (buttocks), noticeable mood swings, and came off one time.
37	246	The shot was horrible and it made me gain 20 lbs and I had horrible mood swings that almost cost me my relationship with my boyfriend as well as the extreme depression  issues it gave me.
37	247	I used the nuva ring before I liked it to a point uncomfortable to me and my boyfriend so I switched to the patch at first it was fine then after a month or less of using it I noticed intense mood swings like bi polar mood swings wanting go off on people for stupid little things being straight up mean to my man and not caring then feel terrible after.
37	248	I have no energy at all always tired I hate myself like this it's not me I'm going to stop this birth control I hate these bad mood swings
37	249	To prevent further problems, my doctor recommended hormone therapy but I haven't done well with any of the pills or the shot - too many bad side effects (sciatica, mood swings, etc).
37	250	Also, the week before my period and during my period, I have intense mood swings and become extremely irritable and emotional.
37	251	My first patch fell off after three days so I put a new one on my thigh instead of my side and that made it not come off anymore but the mix of mood swings and painful symptoms are too much.
37	252	But all of a sudden after 2 weeks I started getting crazy mood swings and sad.
37	253	The main issue from being on this patch, was my mood swings.
37	254	My boyfriend hates it because of my mood swings.
37	255	I can feel depression, anxiety and mood swings getting worse.
37	256	With nexplanon I had horrible never ending spotting/bleeding for 6  months and mood swings,mostly anger, i wasn't in control of myself so this was a great change.
37	257	Had mood swings and on and off bleeding the first month, but after that it worked great ( i did do the quick start method) i usually keep it on my shoulders and i hardly remember its there once i've applied it.
37	258	I tried it again and the physical side effects have faded somewhat but depression anxiety and mood swings are back in my life 10x worse...
37	259	Severe mood swings; my sister and boyfriend have pointed out that I'm always either depressed or behaving like an angry monster.
37	260	Yet the mood swings where HORRIBLE,  I am a fairly unemotional woman but the patch made me unbelievablely weepy for no reason at all.
37	261	I experienced severe mood swings, and Xulane increased my depression and anxiety.
37	262	Now I also have unusual chest pain, back and neck pain all in one and my mood swings are crazy.
37	263	With xulane I have mood swings regularly and I exprience some weakness in my extremities sometimes.
37	264	I'd used Ortho Evra version years ago in college, and the only downside was the constant tiredness and mood swings.
37	265	So of course with the patch not consistently in contact, there's breakthrough bleeding, irregular LONG periods, terrible mood swings.
37	266	After that it was mostly just my poor boyfriend dealing with my mood swings, I was pretty emotional as expected with all those hormones & it didn't last long.
37	267	Did prevent me from getting pregnant but the mood swings were not worth it anymore, will have to move onto the pill.
37	268	On Xulane, I do get mood swings, and since  I seem to be tires a lot.
37	269	I got rashes, I threw up before, my boobs get so tender when my period comes (but that always happened even before taking the patch), and my mood swings are crazy!
37	270	I didn't give the patch a 10 rating because it can get a little itchy (it feels like you're wearing a bandaid) and sometimes it makes me nervous that it's going to fall off.
37	271	I started after my first ever miscarriage, so I was a little weary and nervous of how my periods were going to be since I have been bleeding off and on the past 2-3 months!
37	272	This last month though I began to heavily battle depression to the point where I was very anxious and having suicidal thoughts.
37	273	For all weeks I've been anxious, paranoid, emotional, unable to sleep through the night, and broken out.
37	274	I  pushed through the puking and finished my 3rd week with severe anxiety attacks, panic attacks and depression.
37	275	My first time starting any kind of birth control (just to regulate my period, not really as a contraceptive) and I could only last half way through my third week, the increase in anxiety, depression along with the pregnancy like symptoms were debilitating.
37	276	I chose it because of the comodity of only replacing it once a week but I have to say that as soon as I applied the patch I started feeling anxiety, my arm felt sore where the patch was, I could not fall asleep.
37	277	It has made my anxiety and depression worse!
37	278	Gave me the worst anxiety of my life!
37	279	I have experienced some anxiety, but nothing too serious.
37	280	After being taken off the arm implant due to complications with anxiety, and not being able to remember taking the pill, the patch, I've found, is the most suitable method for me.
37	281	The other main side effect I've experienced is very tender breasts.
37	282	However, I noticed that after wearing a patch for 3 days to a week, I start to get yeast infection symptoms.
37	283	I've gotten about three yeast infections while using Xulane.
38	1	I had a TERRIBLE breakout of acne (no major issues in years).
38	2	I've been on Yasmin for 11 months, I switched this year because on Yaz (5 years on it) I was spotting fairly regularly (more in the last 1.5-2 years).So we decided to try this one because it was the next closest to Yaz (just higher estrogen) and I did not do well on Mirena (18 months on it and I got awful cystic acne along my jaw line, I was losing my hair, and getting body hair in weird places lol I'm not a hairy person, nor do I have acne problems).
38	3	Before taking this, I had very mild acne.
38	4	I haven't gained any weight and I've noticed improvements in my acne, although it's not completely gone yet.
38	5	I was super terrified to try yasmin, but I wanted to try it for my hormonal acne.
38	6	I wished this worked for me cause it seemed best for my acne.
38	7	Within a couple days I had multiple large zits, and I usually have minimal acne.
38	8	I am 15 and mainly wanted it for my acne and I had really really bad cramps and heavy periods.
38	9	Without any birth control, my periods were very regular and my acne was moderate.
38	10	Within the first two weeks, I had acne all over my chin and under my nose.
38	11	Since being on yazmin, my face has completely cleared and I only have a tiny amount of acne left on my upper back.
38	12	I was on Yasmin for a year and a half and although superficially it was okay (no weight gain, no acne etc), mentally I went crazy and this seems to be the case for a lot of women.
38	13	I just started taking this pill not yet through the first week, and already I'm covered in acne which I never had using the IUD.
38	14	Anyways Yasmin has caused me crazy acne like teenager status (I'm 25) and has caused me breast tenderness when I used to feel no tenderness at all.
38	15	When I stopped the pill acne returned very quickly.
38	16	I love how Yasmin clears my acne up without fail (usually within first week).
38	17	My (mild) acne seemed to improve and it was great being in control of my periods.
38	18	It has been helpful with acne.
38	19	I haven't gained any weight and no acne.
38	20	Yaz didn't make me gain weight and it's helped with my acne.
38	21	I had mild acne and now my face is perfectly clear, give or take a monthly pimple.
38	22	After 2 months I became depressed and very moody but the acne on my back cleared up.
38	23	I decided to come off it for my sanity, my moods improved but my acne returned.
38	24	It's GREAT for acne, weight loss and actual birth control, but my mood swings are CRAZY.
38	25	My face was also clear of acne.
38	26	But after about 2 months (3 packs of Yasmin) consuming it due course, I realized that it wasn't only for birth control but it helped my acne as well, and after 3 months, my face was clear off any acne but a few pimples (one or two) here and there but that's easy to treat.
38	27	When I stopped taking Yasmin for about 3 months and my acne came back and now I'm actively on Yasmin again for contraception and also acne.
38	28	Non-stop bleeding, some days heavy, some light, bad acne breakouts, extremely tender breasts, bloating, emotionally unstable, mood swings and panic attacks - all of which I've never had in my life!
38	29	3 day light periods, significantly cleared up my acne, lost weight, my breasts looked great!
38	30	I was put on Yasmin for 6 months to regulate my cycle and reduce acne flare-ups and it was the worst 6 months of my life.
38	31	I gained 20lbs that did NOT come off easily after stopping the pill, experienced horrible mood swings, had HEAVIER periods, acne breakouts, breakthrough bleeding, and I was nauseous all the time.
38	32	Upon resuming, in the 1st month I had NO significant change in acne or facial hair.
38	33	Not only was my cycle completely crazy, I had acne on my shoulders, upper back, and upper arms.
38	34	Anyway after almost 6 years, I have been acne free (maybe the occasional bump or 2) and 4-5 day easy periods!
38	35	Started second pack and in two days experienced painful cramps and light bright red bleeding.
38	36	I am 22 and I've been taking yasmin for almost a year and it's pretty much okay, my skin is clear and cramps and PMS are a lot better than before.
38	37	As awful as this medication is for my mental health, it has been helpful in lowering my flow and cramps.
38	38	Acne cleared up, no cramps or weight gain, no effect on sex-drive and didn't get pregnant.
38	39	It didn't decrease cramps by much.
38	40	It has been great for cramps and I have only experienced slight weight gain (due to increased cravings).
38	41	Yasmin was recommended to me by my doctor to help ease my pains that I had, everyday, every 2 hours I had horrible cramps that would prevent me from any physical activity.
38	42	I have had no weight gain (except maybe a little in my breasts which isn't an issue for me), have had lighter periods and very little menstrual cramps (and I used to have a full 7 day heavy, and painful period), and can't even remember the last time I got a pimple.
38	43	Periods were heavy with cramps I had to take 800mg Ibuprofen for.
38	44	That's when my doctor put me on Yasmin, in a few days I lost the water weight, I don't get cramps, no mood swings, my periods last for 3-4 very light days and I only have them every 3 months, so if your doctor says you can take Yasmin I highly recommend it.
38	45	I've never had a menstrual cramp in my life, I never feel PMS symptoms (bloating, cravings, moodiness, etc).
38	46	Overall light short cramp free periods.
38	47	I'm on my placebo/period week now and cramping and heavy flow.
38	48	My OB prescribed Yasmin to treat my ovulation and menstrual cramping and moderate PMS.
38	49	I'll take cramping and PMS any day over the side effects associated with this pill.
38	50	But other than that I love this pill, my periods were always on time I had short 3-4 day periods with minimal cramping.
38	51	I had 2-3 days of spotting before my period for the last two cycles, which would last at least 7-8 days.
38	52	Then I also had 1-2 days of spotting after my period.
38	53	I love Yasmin, it stopped my spotting, but my sex drive is basically non-existent.
38	54	I also was spotting for 2.5 weeks, but no pain.
38	55	First it was spotting, breast tenderness, mood swings, sadness, headaches, irritability you know the small little things.
38	56	I have started spotting and almost getting a full on period the week before my period.
38	57	I’m losing my hair and going bald, my skin has got worse, headaches, the lot.
38	58	I still got wicked headaches that would make me nauseous, and it decreased my sex drive.
38	59	I have been on Yasmin for 2 days and I have already experienced very noticeable weight loss and headaches and nausea.
38	60	Switched from Microgynon to Yazmin due to suffering with headaches, fatigue & loss of libido.
38	61	Still got headaches too oh and I gained 5lb during 6 mths of using this pill.
38	62	I also got really bad headaches which caused me to be really moody.
38	63	It has made me very moody, I have had really bad headaches, and I have experienced major hair loss.
38	64	Sure, it's getting the job done, I don't have any physical issues really (though I do have headaches, but it may not be from the pill), but overall the moodiness isn't working for me.
38	65	My doctor then switched to the Implanon (under skin implant) for 4 months, breakthrough bleeding continued, got massive headaches.
38	66	Also, I've noticed more frequent migraine headaches, and my hair is thinner but despite this, I think its still the best one for me out there.
38	67	Once I got back on yasmin, I stopped having breakthrough bleeding, headaches, nausea, and everything in between.
38	68	I am thinking about switching to a lower dosage pill but I'm not sure about other pills because I have migraines and I'm worried it'll get worse (yasmin didn't really affect it).
38	69	I suffer from chronic severe migraines possibly hormone related and although in the beginning they got a lot worse, after one year on the pill my migraines have reduced to almost non-existent.
38	70	I had migraines at least 3 attacks a month, I had hypertension.
38	71	During the first year, severe migraines, it felt like my head was going to explode, mood swings, loss of sex drive.
38	72	This past year started having TERRIBLE migraines at least once a week.
38	73	The one biggest side effect for me that made me switch was the migraines I was getting while taking the placebos.
38	74	Each and every month I would have migraines while on my period.
38	75	I have just started taking Levora, which my doctor recommended taking 3 straight months and then having my period to minimize the migraines.
38	76	It caused me vaginal dryness, low sex drive  and pain during intercourse.
38	77	Also I have zero sex drive which is making me feel bad.
38	78	Depression is a silent killer, no sex drive, tired, weight gain.
38	79	But other people said it decreased there sex drive but I feel like it has done the complete opposite for me.
38	80	Over all when I stopped taking it I felt like I had come out of a fog, as if the pill had been dulling senses beyond just my sex drive.
38	81	I have completely lost my sex drive and I don't feel anything during sex.
38	82	I was extremely depressed/ irritated/ bloated/ gained 10 lbs/ sleepy/ no sex drive , I would do rather of had a baby and 9 months of normal than go through that kind of depression.
38	83	Sex drive is non existant its putting a strain on my relationship.
38	84	My sex drive is none existent now I'm so moody
38	85	Sex drive is coming back.
38	86	One downside is my sex drive has diminished but it's hard to tell if the pill is the culprit as I've been on it ten years.
38	87	I have been off Yasmin for two weeks now and am back to my calm and happy self, and my sex drive has returned.
38	88	I've been on Yasmin for nearly two years but I've noticed my sex drive has gone and I get moody a lot more but it didn't make me gain any weight I'm going to change pills when I go to the doctors next.
38	89	BUT my sex drive has been completely gone.
38	90	No changes in sex drive.
38	91	I used Yasmin for about 2 months and in that amount of time it had almost completely killed my sex drive.
38	92	Still no problems other than decreased libido.
38	93	My skin is fine, I didn't have any strange side effects other than the decreased libido.
38	94	It also killed my libido.
38	95	My libido has reduced, I  too experience the occasional paranoia and extreme irritability, my cholesterol and triglycerides have risen although I follow a balanced diet and exercise but I did not gain any weight.
38	96	Very bad experience with this drug...i gained a lot of weight...also it killed my libido!!!
38	97	I switched from Microgynon to Yazmin due to suffering from almost all terrible side effects including fatigue, loss of libido and mood swing.
38	98	I was happier and even had better libido.
38	99	I am slowly losing my libido and became moody.
38	100	This is by far the best pill I've been on and I didn't take the pill for years because of the effects of weight gain, and libido.
38	101	I'm about to reach the inert pill week and so far this is what I've experienced: Tender breasts/nipples, but up 1 size; Improved mood  (history of mood swings, but they were mainly as  teenager, I am now 22); Improved complexion; More intense clitoral sensation; Mild vaginal dryness; Minimal if no weight gain (attributed to increased appetite in general with hormonal birth control); Maybe a mild decrease in libido; No bloating.
38	102	I took Yasmin for 5 years with no side effects except low libido which is why I eventually switched pills.
38	103	I didn't have any weight gain or mood swings though but overall not a pleasant experience I stopped it for a while now and noticed a lot of improvement
38	104	My boobs feel HUGE and tender, but I haven't noticed any weight gain, possible weight loss, but thanks to unusually large boobs I do feel large and heavy.
38	105	No weight gain, clear skin, and my moods are as normal and fluctuate based on my regular monthly hormone fluctuations.
38	106	No weight gain.
38	107	Side effects though are weight gain (around 13 lbs) along with bigger boobs and everything which is really not great.
38	108	Clear skin, no weight gain or side effects.
38	109	As for weight gain, I think I might have gained some water weight, but nothing too noticeable.
38	110	...And the weight gain!
38	111	The only down side is I am so hungry a lot of the time but it's awesome because it doesn't lead to any weight gain so I can eat as much as I want !
38	112	No weight gain from this either!
38	113	For the first year, there was little to no weight gain.
38	114	I gained 150 pounds in less than two years.In that time, I did NOT change the way I ate or how often I exercised.
38	115	In one week, I gained 4 pounds without changing anything, and my stomach stayed hard and bloated looking-it looked like I was pregnant!
38	116	Having an awful time with yasmin have been on it about a year and a half have gained about a stone and a half l. Have tender breasts constantly.
38	117	I never got sick from it, gained any weight, had any pains etc.
38	118	It did its job by not getting me pregnant however I gained a lot of weight.
38	119	I gained weight but not sure if the pill is to blame.
38	120	Was using Ocella for a year and gained 10 pounds.
38	121	I did gain weight...but who knows if it was because of the birth control...like the lady said before she gained in all the "right" places so I can't complain about that one.
38	122	So I started Yasmin on December 29, 2016 & began taking it regularly at 7:30PM to avoid unwanted nausea that's often reported by women who take it early in the morning.
38	123	In the beginning I felt the same but suddenly began having extreme nausea.
38	124	The only side effect I had was nausea.
38	125	I experienced nausea when I took the pill and did not have food in my stomach.
38	126	I switched over because I had started to experience irregular bleeding and just to mention because a lot of women worry about weight, on that contraception I was both oversight and underweight at different times just due to my eating and lifestyle ( don't think contraception made a difference) so far my experience of Yasmin has been good, I never had 'acne' but I swear overnight and since starting it I have not had one more pimple and skin has just felt a lot nicer( not too dry not too oily) I had the initial nausea for about 2 or 3 days and the occasional breast tenderness but hey that's to be expected when you are changing your hormones?
38	127	Few complaints, at the beginning this pill caused me horrible nausea and breast pain but that could be due to changing to Yasmin from Microgynon 30.
38	128	Took Yasmin for 6 months now and had some nausea in the beginning but I think my body is getting used to the pill.
38	129	I feel nausea, heartburn, same symptoms as a pregnancy.
38	130	The only bad thing that did happen to me was that I got EXTREMELY nauseated and sick on the third day of taking the pill.
38	131	I’ve only been on the pill for four days but I’ve been nauseous from the second day of taking the pill.
38	132	I was slightly nauseous for the first 2 days.
38	133	It also made me nauseous all the time.
38	134	Ive been nauseous for about 4 days and it just has not let up.
38	135	I was so nauseous, I really thought I was pregnant.
38	136	I have tried Yasmin twice and this time it made me so nauseous that I couldn't go to college so I stopped.
38	137	This is my second pack, I have never felt worse, microgynon never made me feel so sick, I'm nauseous for a week and a half , everyday!
38	138	I reccently started the Yasmin pill and at first I honestly didn't think I would be able to carry on with it because it was making me feel so nauseous!
38	139	I started feeling dizzy and fainting a lot.
38	140	Does it get any better ?I’m also feeling dizzy and can’t seem to keep any food down.
38	141	But more severely I have heart palpitations, dizziness, and now high blood pressure
38	142	I had super heavy discharge (which was extremely uncomfortable) as well as horrible mood swings and unbearable night sweats.
38	143	My mood swings were crazy, I’d cry constantly for NO reason!
38	144	I am new to birth control and was worried about taking a hormonal pill because I'd heard that people can have mood swings or feel depression or gain weight... luckily NOTHING like that has happened to me during my first month.
38	145	If anything, it actually helped me with my mood swings.
38	146	I became paranoid and depressed while having violent and unpredictable mood swings.
38	147	I think I'd rather live like a vampire than try and cope with the mood swings from this pill.
38	148	My poor fiancé has even mentioned how bad my mood swings have been and it makes me feel awful being so up and down all the time.
38	149	They have helped me lose weight, no hair lost instead it has been growing, no mood swings, no depression.
38	150	I agree with some of the comments on here about mood swings but I also think that is to do with my own level of hormones and that if you stick with it after a while this pill does work!!
38	151	I have PCOS and struggle with mood swings, hair loss, and pretty severe hirsutism.
38	152	I've tried going on Yasmin twice before after being on different pills (I changed because of weight-gain), but never lasted more than 3 days on it because of the intense mood swings on it.
38	153	I get major mood swings, feel like I'm always on the verge of crying, getting easily irritated, getting jealous/paranoid and have a strange feeling of 'self-awareness'.
38	154	Also I experienced spells of depressive moods which have now cleared up but I often experience mood swings!
38	155	Overall, my mood has gotten better, I used to experience mood swings.
38	156	I also had terrible mood swings and angry outburts.
38	157	I also had terrible mood swings.
38	158	I was on Yaz for about 6 months and I still had terrible mood swings so I switched to Loestrin and have me very happy so far.
38	159	I had irritable mood swings but nothing too bad.
38	160	No PMS, no mood swings.
38	161	No mood swings.
38	162	Although, after reading some reviews, I have noticed that I feel more sensitive emotionally now since being on Yasmin, I don't feel like I get mood swings per say where I'm mad, more like its easier for me to cry for something I normally wouldn't have cried so easily before.
38	163	So my doctor switched me to Yasmin and the first month was great, no more horrible mood swings, I was almost on euphoric high.
38	164	The second month I completely crashed, I started having hot flashes, mood swings, ovarian pain, hair loss, anxiety and a general feeling of non-well-being.
38	165	As soon as I started taking this, I was am emotional, angry, anxious mess.
38	166	I became extremely moody, weepy, depressed, anxious, paranoid and jealous.
38	167	I always felt anxious.
38	168	I was anxious, my mind was foggy, I was snappy and overly aggressive (which is very unlike me), and generally just didn't feel myself.
38	169	After taking this pill I've become crazy, anxious, depressed, upset and stressed out over the tiniest things (causing major fights with my boyfriend) at all points in my cycle.
38	170	Also just started to notice some irritability and anxiety.
38	171	The anxiety made my chest tight and it was hard to take deep breaths at times.
38	172	I then spoke to a doctor following an anxiety breakdown and they said it could've been due to my pill.
38	173	This pill has given me high anxiety, made me feel depressed all the time.
38	174	Yet, my breast seems to be bigger, had shorter and lighter period, and haven't had breast pain and fatigue at all.
38	175	The second month, slight  breast tenderness and, my face was less oily.
38	176	Into month 3, breast tenderness is gone and improvements in skin and hair continue.
39	1	Also taking it to help with acne.
39	2	Whilst on this pill I constantly bled, had acne (I never get acne), and my migraines were the worst I’ve ever had them and I’m a chronic migraine sufferer - it came back all day every day for 5 days.
39	3	I’ve broken out so badly with acne and I’ve ALSO been spotting now for almost 2 weeks now becoming heavier bleeding and cramps.
39	4	My acne is gone, my periods are light with mild cramping only lasting 5 days at the most, I had severe PMDD before going on Yaz and now I still get emotional of course but it's helped control my severe mood swings so much.
39	5	Another strange thing was it gave me little red bumps all over my face that weren't acne but just texture.
39	6	I was put on yaz for my acne and it did help in some sense, but it is not worth feeling like crap 24/7.
39	7	Though I have lesser acne.
39	8	I struggled with a sudden constant acne breakout on my chin (hormones).
39	9	Doctor prescribed Yaz, especially to help with the acne.
39	10	I complained about acne to my doctor and she recommended it, but I did not notice a drastic difference in my breakouts while on the pill.
39	11	no sudden water weight gain, no acne, but I was a short while on this medication, the thing is it made me quite emotional in the last few days and , but probably it is that I am just in an emotional period of my life and the pill made my emotions a bit more raw, I just did not want to deal with that and stopped.
39	12	The only reason why I am giving it 2 stars is because it did clear my acne better than any product I have ever used.
39	13	I was on Yaz for 3 months, my acne is worse than ever, I gained a lot of weight, my mental health has never been so bad - anxiety, depression, my self esteem is so low it's terrifying.
39	14	It controlled my pms symptoms migraines , acne weight the works.
39	15	I switched to this from Junel Fe because I was hoping to help my acne and weight gain (gained 10 pounds on Junel).
39	16	After dealing with bad acne, my dr. recommended Yaz.
39	17	However, 6 months later I am still experiencing spotting, extreme depression and anxiety, lack of motivation, acne, breast tenderness for 3 weeks of the month, and chest pain and shortness of breath.
39	18	im using yaz 2 years now and its so effective for me i try many other pills but the side efffects is it takes a bad to my health but when i take yaz my i have no acne ang it lightens my skin.
39	19	I have been on yaz now for about a year and a bit for my acne.
39	20	I never really had and acne except the occasional pimple before my period.
39	21	No more mood swings or acne outbreaks.
39	22	I'm a full-time athlete, never really struggled with acne but wanted to experience a birth control as my periods were irregular which disrupted my trainings and travel.
39	23	I've never really suffered from acne in my life but the first month being on Yaz I had experienced the most pimples I've ever had.
39	24	It cleared up my acne completely by month 3, which is why I am on it, but the mood swings are not worth clear skin.
39	25	Feeling this bad is not worth clear skin, but I give it a 3 only because it did clear up my acne amazingly.
39	26	I chose this BC not only for these symptoms and contraception, but also for acne.
39	27	I didn't see a major change in the acne.
39	28	My acne has always been mild, break out near period usually.
39	29	This pill is my first one and it's okay BUT My acne is not gone already (after 3 months).
39	30	I have cystic acne in the chin, around the mouth.
39	31	The good is that the mild acne I did have is now non-existent, no more cramps, and my cycle is the lightest it's ever been.
39	32	Worked great for clearing up acne.
39	33	I was lucky to not have acne so I can't speak on that but hopefully I can figure out how to get rid of the headaches and weird emotional attacks where I cry for no reason.
39	34	My acne is GONE - none at all and I used to break out badly on my back.
39	35	I've had a really bad acne breakout and I have started to get panic attacks so bad that it's hard to physically and emotionally function.
39	36	I had some moderate acne before taking the pill, and was needing to get back on a birth control and figured that yaz would be a good bet.
39	37	I was put on Yaz for hormonal acne (chin and jaw line).
39	38	I've had TERRIBLE experiences with birth control, weight gain, acne, mood swings, etc.
39	39	Within a week my acne was completely gone!
39	40	I'm 18 years old and I started taking Yaz when I was 14 for the use of treating acne.
39	41	It did not do much for my acne so I began taking Accutane.
39	42	My acne went away, and then I got a boyfriend so I stayed on Yaz.
39	43	I had no problems with it and it did clear up my acne, which was mild anyway.
39	44	My mild acne cleared up and I have beautiful skin, and before Yaz I had very irregular periods that would last for 2 weeks at a time.
39	45	I do not suffer from any acne with the exception of the couple days preceding my period (minor and unpreventable chin acne due to hormones/menstruation).
39	46	I also got all the acne gone and I have regular periods.
39	47	I started on Lo Loestrin FE for Polycystic ovarian syndrome and then changed to Yaz since my insurance didn't cover Lo Loestrin and besides that it was giving me acne and I was on a emotional roller-coaster.
39	48	With Yaz, I was feeling way better, slight acne, no weight gain, BUT yeast infections.
39	49	I've noticed some improvement in my acne.
39	50	Since starting Yaz, I've noticed no major weight changes (maybe lost a few pounds, but I attribute that to stress) and some minor acne breakouts.
39	51	My skin also erupted with acne.
39	52	I lost weight and had no acne.
39	53	I've had no issues and it kept the major cramps, acne, and babies away.
39	54	Although, I do get acne during my period, but it consist of 2-3 pimples that go away when my period stops.
39	55	It made my acne disappear and made my body hair slightly thinner/took care of a weird chin hair that I had.
39	56	It controls my hormones and lightens up my period plus great for your face if you have acne.
39	57	Ever since I've been on it I haven't had acne.
39	58	I recommend this mostly to teens for acne and hormones.
39	59	The only good thing that came from Yaz was that it completely cleared up my mild acne, I mean flawless skin.
39	60	Overall great pill for acne, bad for other side effects.
39	61	I was put on Yaz due to my bad acne.
39	62	Ever since taking it my periods have been lighter, shorter, my acne has lessened (not disappeared), and have gained no weight (at least due to the pill).
39	63	During that time, I developed cysts on my ovaries, extremely heavy periods and awful cystic acne on my chin.
39	64	My periods regulated, the cysts disappeared (shrank) and my acne cleared (in 3/4 months; it was very bad).
39	65	I stopped that, and for whatever reason the doctor didn't put me back on Yaz, just a different generic of something else that made me lose libido, gain weight, get acne everything bad.
39	66	Didn't work, still all bad mood swings and acne but found out about polycystic ovarian syndrome.
39	67	I've never had acne, but Yaz definitely cleared up even the tiniest pimples.
39	68	Overall, I would definitely recommend this pill for acne and birth control.
39	69	I never had weight gain, it helped with my acne and period were about 3 days long with lighter cramping than before I was on it.
39	70	While I experienced less mood swings and PMS symptoms than I had on Jolessa, my acne continued and even got worse and I recently had a panic attack - something I have never ever experienced before.
39	71	All gave me terrible mood swings, weight gain, and acne.
39	72	The first two years, I took the pill for moderate acne.
39	73	It is a great pill with minor side effects (headaches, spotting, breakthrough, acne flare-ups between packs).
39	74	I originally got on the pill to treat acne and went through two other types of birth control pills before changing to Yaz.
39	75	Yaz cleared up my acne, stopped my cramps, and made my period much shorter and much lighter.
39	76	My acne got worse, and I had terrible breast tenderness, to the point where I couldn't wear a bra or sleep on my side or stomach.
39	77	I felt like my normal self, with my normal sex drive, normal weight but without the monster cramps, severe acne and moodiness before my period, and the long 8 day cycle.
39	78	Definitely helped with acne and mood swings.
39	79	It did help my acne, I'll give it credit for that but on it I gained about 20 pounds and it's been really hard to take that weight off.
39	80	Depo was by far the worst with over 15lbs weight gain in a year, horrible acne and leg cramps.
39	81	I have short, light periods and my acne has decreased.
39	82	I went from having severe back acne and moderate face acne to........almost NO ACNE!!
39	83	For the first time in my teen years (Im 17), i am not embarrased about my face, and i can wear a bathing suite without being embarrassed about severe back acne.
39	84	I was taking Yaz for about 6-7 months and had great results with decreased acne and shorter menstrual periods.
39	85	I was so uncontrollably moody, and it made my acne worse.
39	86	I had no problems with acne nor weight gain.
39	87	I've had no acne problems, no weight gain (with no change in my eating habits), and amazingly regular and light periods.
39	88	My boobs have grown and my acne has subsided.
39	89	After about 3 months, the acne I had been dealing with my entire life was 100% gone and has not returned for over a year.
39	90	I decided to switch to Yaz to gain weight and clear up my mild acne.
39	91	I have constant heartburn, I've gained 10 lbs., I'm tired all the time, my acne has returned and I've been spacey and forgetful.
39	92	My complaints are that I have seen random acne pop up here and there on my face, and a little breakthrough bleeding.
39	93	I needed a birth control pill to take when I was on Accutane for acne, and this is the one my Ob/gyn prescribe.
39	94	Well I can't say what impact the Yaz had on my acne, since I was also taking Accutane and that would have had a much bigger effect but I did like the lighter and shorter periods.
39	95	I have no mood swings and my acne cleared completely, I get one or 2 zits before I get my regular period once a month.
39	96	I was on Loestrin 24 Fe for around 2 years, worked as a birth control pill, didn't gain any weight, was able to lose weight, wasn't moody, only had slight acne... which is why my gynecologist put me on Yaz.
39	97	I'd rather have terrible acne than feel the way I do on this pill.
39	98	I have gained no weight and have no issues with acne.
39	99	It completely cleared up my acne and my breasts significantly increased in size but were very sore all the time.
39	100	It was an effective form of birth control, which was the major reason I used it for, but similar to the shot I had almost no libido, was very emotional and had bad acne.
39	101	I've been happy, acne is going away, no bad side effects and libido is up.
39	102	My first experience was breaking out.
39	103	But I am now in month four, and am hardly breaking out!
39	104	Now onto my second month I am seeing slow improvement, still getting a few pimples.
39	105	I did have some weight gain in the belly area but it helps with pimples and my PMS is better.
39	106	I found that I started to break out after I got off it and no matter what face products I used, the pimples would not go away.
39	107	It took a few months to kick in but my period pains aren't as bad as they used to be, I'm happier, my sex drive is great and my pimples are finally clearing up!
39	108	My skin cleared up, besides a few pimples around my period, I gained maybe 5 pounds (my breasts got larger, but who's complaining), and as someone who suffers from generalized anxiety disorder, I have found no issues.
39	109	I get a few pimples every now and then commonly when my period comes.
39	110	Other positives: my skin is clear except for one or two small pimples around period time, my mood is more regular (prior to Yaz, I would feel like crying/emotional right before my period) and my cysts are controlled.
39	111	I was on this for awhile, then I started to break out with zits uncontrollably like I was a teenager again.
39	112	My bleeding is way way heavier but my cramps way lighter.
39	113	Both months about three weeks into the pack I get headaches, nausea, upper stomach cramps, exhaustion, throwing up, extremely sensitive breasts, horrible uterine cramps, sporadic facial hair growth (I have facial hair due to PCOS and I was hoping yaz would reduce it but it seems to make it grow faster during certain times of the month), and a terrible liquid yellow diarrhea (tmi I know).
39	114	I'm not pregnant, my skin is clear, my period is lighter/shorter, my cramps are gone, and I lost weight!!!!
39	115	It hurt my work performance and gave me horrible headaches and body cramps.
39	116	The only thing that changed is that my periods are shorter and now I don't have to use drugs to prevent menstrual cramps, because there are none.
39	117	I used to have cramps so bad I was unable to attend school or work.
39	118	I had been taking it previously from 2013-2014 (prescribed to me 1st, for menstrual cramps and oily/hormonal breakout skin).
39	119	I also experienced severe cramps, migraines, and bled for 2 weeks.
39	120	I have always had light periods (panty liner light) and no cramps.
39	121	When I took this birth control I had such horrible cramps that I kept throwing up.
39	122	My old periods would cause severe cramps, nausea, vomiting, periods lasting up to 16 days, and horrible mood swings.
39	123	I am crying constantly, I'm getting cramps like there's no tomorrow and feeling nauseous randomly.
39	124	I had irregular periods with a very heavy flow, mood swings, depression, anxiety, anger issues, cramps, etc.
39	125	My skin cleared up (any other breakouts was mostly from the heat) and it didn't really cause any cramps.
39	126	And my cramps have gotten worse, I didn't even think it was possible.
39	127	The heavy bleeding, agony and cramps have all stopped.
39	128	Horrible cramps, heavy bleeding, soaking thru tampons in an hour or less, passing of large clots, headaches.
39	129	My only problems are that when it is close to  my period my cramps are worse than ever.
39	130	My period is way lighter and cramps are much better than they used to be.
39	131	I used to suffer with heavy bleeding and cramps that had me bedridden.
39	132	My weight never changed, my skin was beautiful, normal sex drive, no cramps, 3-4 days periods.
39	133	This was the first birth control pill I went on because I was having heavy periods and cramps but also because I started having sex.
39	134	It also made my periods irregular and gave me awful cramps.
39	135	It caused my cramps to stop completely and I had no side effects the only thing I had was a loss in my sex drive.
39	136	At first, it was wonderful for me because it helped eliminate the painful cramps I was suffering before and I had no side effects.
39	137	I don't get cramps, bloating, etc.
39	138	Only slightly reduced PMS (cramps, bloating, etc.)
39	139	It also helped with my awful cramps.
39	140	I felt like it helped with my moods and cramps before my period and just worked great overall.
39	141	I never had any weight gain, or horrible mood swings and cramps were reduced drastically.
39	142	I don't have cramps or feel tired while on my period and it is very light and last only 2 or 3 days!
39	143	Less bleeding and basically no cramps.
39	144	I would recommend it if you have severe cramps like I did.
39	145	I was a monster before starting Yaz and now I'm normal with occasional periods having slight mood swings or cramps.
39	146	I'm getting severe cramps, migraines and I get really nauseous when I'm on my period, which are heavier now than they ever were and last usually about 8 days, last month it lasted 11!
39	147	The only issue is that over time, my cramps became almost unbearable.
39	148	I haven't had any symptoms really but I have had the occasional cramps.
39	149	I had horrible cramps, worse than when I was in high school, and bad migraines the week prior to my period.
39	150	Good: less severe cramps, lighter periods, lighter facial hair (my little peach fuzz mustache disappeared).
39	151	Yaz gave me horrible mood swings, depression, headache, sickness, leg cramp, hair loss, slow foggy brain, etc.
39	152	My back and abdomin cramp at the same time (that's usual) and normally the only way to get rid of them is heat, so I take a bath and not even that is helping and of course the heat would make me more nauseous.
39	153	Well my Dr wanted me to try it instead of depo.. but I cramp while not even on my period now and have chest pains about an hour after taking it.
39	154	I did get super emotional for about 3 days a month where almost anything would make me cry and where I would get the occasional extreme cramp.
39	155	I was on for 1 year & 1/2 years and I notice I was developing muscle leg cramping , red spider veins on my legs.
39	156	I read how it could be dangerous if you develop blood clot because of birthcontrol I discontinue the use but now I'm back of hotflashes no leg cramping but hotflashing
39	157	Since getting on Yaz I do still have some cramping but it is manageable with midol.
39	158	My period got lighter, I stopped cramping as much.
39	159	I am 24 years old and have always had heavy periods with severe cramping on the front end of my cycle.
39	160	My period was much much lighter lasting about 3-4 days and the cramping was much more tolerable....
39	161	Heavy bleeding and intense cramping were my primary concerns for starting birth control and since I still bled heavy on my first pill I was switched to Yaz.
39	162	After a while, I got no period while on Yaz, not even spotting or cramping, which was a huge plus.
39	163	My one negative is the cramping when I forget to take it but even that isn't bad.
39	164	I will always get it on a Tuesday night and lasts only 2-3 days with light spotting and very little cramping.
39	165	Now, my monthly cycles are very light, but the cramping is still the same.
39	166	I have had no weight gain, no cramping and only 3 day periods with very little bleeding and the best part is no irritability or major mood swings.
39	167	I had really heavy periods and severe cramping before I was on Yaz and Yaz made my periods almost invisible.
39	168	No cramping, light bleeding, and I had energy.
39	169	It improves my mood and makes my periods very light with hardly any cramping.
39	170	I'm spotting nonstop right now.
39	171	After taking the 15th day  I am guaranteed brown discharge and then some spotting, which I shouldn't be getting.
39	172	I've had quite a bit of spotting especially after intercourse which is actually active bleeding.
39	173	Since I started, I was spotting for days at a time randomly in the middle of my cycle.
39	174	I also found my period to extend much longer, spotting for another 5 days after and I was getting a little worried but after 2 weeks of that, everything got better.
39	175	Between the weight gain, now swelling legs, being tired all the time, no sex drive, mood swings like no ones business, and random spotting, the only thing good that has came out of these pills is the fact I haven't gotten pregnant.
39	176	The bad is the random spotting.
39	177	One week later Im spotting again!!
39	178	With Yaz, my periods are much lighter to the point where I'm only spotting but then I'm spotting for almost a week and a half and even though I'm on the blanks, my period does not start now until almost the second week of my new pack.
39	179	I have a regular cycle with no spotting.
39	180	I have very minimal side effects (some breast tenderness, occasional spotting).
39	181	There are only two negatives that I have found: if you forget to take a pill, you start spotting.
39	182	I also bleed irregularly and have constant random spotting.
39	183	I've been using Yaz for 3 years now, I haven't had much side effects, I've had spotting on the odd time but other then that this is a very effective birth control.
39	184	About 9 months in I did have some spotting for about 3 months but it was also during a stressful time of my life.
39	185	I didn't really have any mood swings that were out of the ordinary for me, no spotting or weight gain, no problems at all really.
39	186	For the first few months my periods were a bit irregular with slight spotting but that evened out in about January.
39	187	I have only experienced one occurrence in 3 years of using Yaz, of spotting when not missing a pill.
39	188	Yaz must be taken at the same time daily or spotting may occur.
39	189	I had no noticeable weight gain or hair loss/growth or spotting.
39	190	There is no spotting though, no bloating, no headaches and I think I lost weight which is a plus.
39	191	I could even see blue spot under skin and my fingertip went white and numb.
39	192	Also tried Implanon, the arm implant, but continually spotted for a year before having it removed.
39	193	Also, I skipped a day in week 3 and I spotted for 2 weeks up until my cycle.
39	194	I'd feel so much headache to the point my brain became foggy when I tried to work.
39	195	I only took the pill for five days but had to leave work early two days and went straight to bed by 6pm every night due to a severe headache and overall feeling of lethargy and dizziness.
39	196	No headache today, no feverish feeling, no anxiety.
39	197	I feel great and the only problem I have is a light headache when I'm taking the white pills (last 4).
39	198	But now, with no period, I have no headache!
39	199	I never get headaches unless I have the flu but my head constantly hurts.
39	200	Other side effects have been increased heart rate, tight chest/trouble breathing, & chronic headaches.
39	201	While it eliminated my migraine headaches and made my period shorter, lighter, and diminished PMS symptoms - it gave me an awful intermittent tingling sensation in and around my extremities, a dull pain at the base of my skull, vertigo, heart racing and dizzy spells; not to mention a few near syncope experiences - one of which landed me in the ER.
39	202	I have put on 2kg which I'm not completely sure if it's been this pill or that I have increased my weights by a great margin..My boobs have also seen a significant increase in size.In the last month I have experienced,migraines,headaches,nausea.
39	203	I get headaches alot.
39	204	I get some pretty intense headaches as well.
39	205	I still have a sex drive, I don't get headaches, bitchiness, or stomach aches.
39	206	For the first weeks or so I was very tired and had excruciating headaches, both of which were very out of character for me.
39	207	I've always gotten headaches before I start my period so that was nothing new.
39	208	Another negative it gave me chronic headaches and an upset stomach 24/7.
39	209	Recently my breasts have been swollen and tender, I get headaches during my period and feel anxious.
39	210	I had constant nausea, would feel sick eating anything with lactose, had mood swings that almost cost me my relationship, unbearable headaches and at times I had sharp shooting back pain.
39	211	I suffered from severe headaches about two days after I started Yaz.
39	212	The headaches continued almost every day.
39	213	I no longer have headaches.
39	214	In addition, I had severe headaches and fatigue.
39	215	It made me depressed and made my PMS even worse accompanied with headaches.
39	216	I've lost 10 pounds on it, I no longer suffer from PMDD, my periods are short and regular, and it cures my headaches.
39	217	The worst of them is debilitating intense headaches 2-3 days before my period.
39	218	When I start taking the placebo pills, I get blinding headaches!
39	219	I know down to the hour when I'm going to get my period and it only lasts 4 days, and is light because of the headaches, I am switching to Loestrin 24 fe.
39	220	I hope it gets rid of the headaches and some of the other side effects.
39	221	I am not sure why the medicine changed on me, but I recently switched to Loestrin24 because I couldn't handle the mood swings and headaches any longer.
39	222	Breakthrough bleeding, severe mood swings, headaches, and unpredictable periods.
39	223	I do have headaches.
39	224	I'd say the only negative were my massive headaches when I did have my period.
39	225	The headaches would come on my first day of my period.
39	226	I became moody, emotional, it gave me headaches, lowered my sex drive, and gave me anxiety.
39	227	Yaz did not work for me, is an excellent birth control but my sex drive went down, and caused me terrible headaches, gained weight, felt tired all the time.
39	228	After being on it for a couple months, I started getting weekly headaches.
39	229	I decided to go off of Yaz to see if the headaches would go away and I'd stop gaining weight.
39	230	Sure enough, after about 2 weeks the headaches stopped completely.
39	231	I have had horrible headaches that would grow into migraines, which is not good especially with a 3 yr old and 1 yr old.
39	232	I've been taking YAZ for about 5 months and lately I've been having headaches.
39	233	I don't know if these are tension headaches or if the pill is one of the causes.
39	234	I often had intense headaches and stomach aches but no nausea.
39	235	I do agree, however, that it does make me a little tired and I do have some headaches (during the period week)- but nothing like the monster headaches I got on some other brands.
39	236	I love yaz, it has it's downs like the tiredness and sometimes the bad headaches, but overall it's been a great birth control for me.
39	237	(Continuation) It was on the fourth month, my condition got better but still with bouts of migraine and what I noticed is that I somehow smell "down there".
39	238	I had heavy bleeding for 2 weeks straight and a week before my period I went into depression and had severe migraines.
39	239	I do have major migraines, but its due to an eye condition.
39	240	When I started taking the generic pills I felt the exact same and chalked it up to taking Yaz for so long, except when I recently switched back to Yaz my breasts were tender and a few days before my period I had bad migraines.
39	241	I got severe migraines right at the start of my period and it would last about two days.
39	242	Some side effects I experienced were weight gain, severe depression, nightmares, severe migraines, and heartburn.
39	243	I noticed a drastic change in my sex drive(like no sex drive at all, my poor BF), and insane mood swings and starting to feel sadness.
39	244	I am nervous since I am reading a lot about the weight gain and mood swings and low sex drive involved with Microgestin which is what I'm trying to get away from.
39	245	When I switched to yaz I honestly felt miserable and immediately noticed my sex drive decreased drastically and I had low energy all the time.
39	246	Also, My sex drive is super low.
39	247	The main side effect I have experienced is decreased sex drive which is unfortunate but it beats the pain from endometriosis or cysts.
39	248	That may sound like a good thing, but if you are a woman with normal to low levels already, further lowering will cause low energy, low motivation, low sex drive, and feeling generally crappy.
39	249	I decided to switch because I had been on it so long and thought maybe that was the reason for the decreased sex drive.
39	250	I didn't find my sex drive to be any less than it was before and overall, positive experience so far.
39	251	The only complaint I have is that it has killed my sex drive and is causing problems in my relationship.
39	252	I have been on yaz for 5 weeks i have put on 7kilos wake up to swollen fingers have sore hard breast completely no sex drive and the worst a week after taking yaz i got a chest infection thought was viral had antibiotics its now 4 weeks of chest infection googled yaz symptoms and saw it can cause upper respiratory infectuions omg couldn't belive a month of hardly being abile to breath time off work and doctors visits to descover its yaz causing it i stoped it today and have had a bad head ache tonight hope its out of my system quickly
39	253	No sex drive while on pill.
39	254	My sex drive improved as well( I didn't expect that).
39	255	My sex drive is very, very, very low and I'm very dry down there.
39	256	I've been taking it for 7 months, and for the last 4 months, I've noticed a decrease in sex drive, very very little lubrication, and haven't gotten my period for the last 3 months... which is a scary thing.
39	257	The only negative for me was my sex drive became non-existent.
39	258	My skin looks great, I have more energy, I haven't gained a single pound, my periods are light, I still have a sex drive, and my emotions are not all over the place.
39	259	I had vaginal dryness throughout, just took a little more time to get me going although no change in sex drive.
39	260	I went to a new doctor and she first gave me a different pill which made me moody and have little to no sex drive which for a 22yr old is a bit ridiculous, but YAZ once again made everything better.
39	261	My breasts grew a bit my appetite is back to normal rather than eating all the time and my sex drive is very much up to par.
39	262	At first I had emotional issues I believe were caused by the pill and a low sex drive.
39	263	I had absolutely no sex drive!
39	264	Now I am on Yaz and I feel like myself, I have a normal sex drive, I haven't gained any weight.
39	265	It made my skin great, I lost weight, controlled my crazy mood swings, and totally increased my sex drive.
39	266	No weight gain, no tenderness, no periods, no crazy anger, and my sex drive has improved 100% since I was on Nuvaring before.
39	267	No mood swings or depression, my sex drive has increased, my skin looks great and my periods are highly predictable.
39	268	No weight gain no depression, I have tons of energy, I still have my sex drive, and no crazy out of control mood swings.
39	269	Loestrin24 wasn't far behind with chronic exhaustion, zero sex drive and depression.
39	270	Also, decreased sex drive, and tiredness.
39	271	Overall my periods were lighter and shorter, but Yaz has severely decreased my sex drive.
39	272	My sex drive has increased, believe it or not.
39	273	My sex drive is still not what it used to be but I understand that most birth control pills cause a decrease in libido.
39	274	I was on Yaz for about 2 years and loved it except for the severe drop in sex drive.
39	275	I wake up drenched and I have a loss of sex drive and I'm only 18 so that's not good.
39	276	I have been taking Yaz for 4 months now and am severely depressed, gained 5 pounds, and have no sex drive.
39	277	I gained a few pounds but it can be fixed, I am 20 years old and I have no mood swings, sex drive is the same and I love this pill.
39	278	I'm tired all the time, depressed, no sex drive.
39	279	I have not had a major decrease in sex drive, but have had a dramatic change in vaginal dryness that would make times unbearable.
39	280	The only side effects I really ever noticed were an increased sex drive, increase in breast size, decrease in appetite, mild reoccurring yeast infections (I've tested positive for track/yeast infections a few times but with little to no pain).
39	281	My skin looks great, I wake up happy as can be, no emotional issues, sex drive up.
39	282	Bad: Emotional mood swings every month on the first day taking the placebo pill, dramatically decreased sex drive.
39	283	But the decreased sex drive put a strain on my relationship so I am trying something different now.
39	284	My sex drive was bipolar, however, and taking the pill also gave me occasional slight dizziness, yeast infection, moodiness, anxiety, and even depression which I had never experienced before.
39	285	I did notice a decreased libido and this wasn't until after I went off the pill for a month.
39	286	Along with my moodiness, I became anxious, depressed and found that my libido had disappeared completely.
39	287	While my weight and mood went back to normal, my libido took forever to reappear and I still feel it's not the same.
39	288	I had a healthy libido, and I didn't really think that BC could change that.
39	289	The biggest three changes were mood swings, change in menstrual flow, and a HUGE decrease in libido.
39	290	The lack of libido has been a huge deal in my marriage.
39	291	On the negative side, this pill brought my libido into the negative.
39	292	Also dryness became an issue which of course further effected my libido in a negative way, besides just being embarrassing in general.
39	293	My libido slowly started to ebb.
39	294	Very clear skin, no weight gain, little to no period, no changes in my personality or mood... nothing!
39	295	I haven't had any negative side effects like weight gain or mood swings.
39	296	Im 20 yr old and have been on birth control for 2 yr now ive tried every pill and even the implant each of them have cause horrid pains and bleeding, i havent got pregnant but experience  bad moods and weight gain, nodoctor can seem to help its very frustrating that each  doctors visit ive only been  prescribed  a higher dosage  of the pill (now yaz) i feel like the only person who is experiencing  this and if the doctors cant help what the heck am i supposed  to do
39	297	Almost immediately, I experienced an annoying, impossible to get rid of weight gain.
39	298	I did not experience any mood swings or weight gain!
39	299	It%u2019s highly effective in preventing pregnancy and I have not noticed any weight gain.
39	300	There was little to no weight gain, it didn't make me have any mood swings.
39	301	Lighter and shorter periods, cleared up my skin and no bloating or weight gain.
39	302	I took every pill under the sun, including the shot but always suffered terrible side effects from nausea and vomiting, to crazy mood swings, depression, anxiety and weight gain.
39	303	No noticeable weight gain or loss.
39	304	Tiredness, Spotting, Weight gain (went from 105 to 127) but then again that's not as bad as it could be.
39	305	Ortho wasn't bad, but I did experience weight gain (about 5lbs in a year).
39	306	I would cry for absolutely no reason or from the smallest thing, be very irritable and angry over little things, depressed, nightmares, hungry all the time, extremely tired all the time- coffee did nothing, weight gain etc.
39	307	While on Yaz for a short time, I had anxiety, depression, bloating, and weight gain.
39	308	Nevertheless, after that adjustment period, I leveled out somewhat and experiences some pro's: clearer skin, fuller breasts, no noticeable weight gain (though I diet like a jockey) and of course no babies.
39	309	I haven't noticed any weight gain due to the pill.
39	310	I have suffered little weight gain (but then again, I'm a freshman).
39	311	Not sure about weight gain, if any.
39	312	The period was very light for me and it had no impact on weight gain or weight loss.
39	313	I've never, ever had a problem with weight gain before.
39	314	Weight gain and tiredness on this medicine.
39	315	I gained weight too.
39	316	I have exercised and dieted with nothing more than a pound gained or the scale not moving.
39	317	I also gained a little weight, got hives, and regularly have stomach pains now.
39	318	I also noticed that I gained 2 pounds in the week I was on Yaz.
39	319	The only issue I find is I have gained fat (but not weight??)
39	320	I gained about 12 pounds (all in my boobs, thighs, love handles and stumach) as i eat a ton now, i actually am starting to feel like im falling into depression again, im always ready to snap, and im in a constant state of exhaustion.
39	321	i gained 2kg, but I am not sure it's really related to Yaz.
39	322	Acne, mood changes, gained 20 pounds in 3 weeks.
39	323	The only side effect is that I gained weight but that's nothing compared to how amazingly it works.
39	324	However, I went from a 34 a to a 34 d in 3 months and gained 15 pounds that no matter how much I exercised I couldn't lose.
39	325	I also gained some weight.
39	326	I know everyone is different but I really did not notice how much weight I gained, my infection is terrible and I am switching.
39	327	I've been the same size for 10 years but while on Yaz I gained about 15 pounds and went up two cup sizes!
39	328	I went off Yaz for 2 months and actually gained weight and was hungry 24/7.
39	329	I haven't gained a pound, and my periods are so light and they only last about three days.
39	330	I went off Yaz for a few months and actually gained weight.
39	331	I have not gained any weight.
39	332	I gained about 10 pounds on Yaz.
39	333	The weight I have gained was from muscle weight from working out.
39	334	I gained ten pounds on Alesse and then lost it when I began Yaz.
39	335	I gained 25 pounds and am heavier than I've ever been in my life!
39	336	I haven't gained any more weight either, and I've been off of Yaz for about a year now.
39	337	Unfortunately, I'm having problems losing all the weight I gained!
39	338	I have never weighed this much in my life, I gained about 20 pounds.
39	339	I have had horrible mood swings and have gained weight.
39	340	I only took this medication for about 10 days, but I heard horror stories about birth control so was scared of taking it, but really it caused nothing major, just a bit of nausea that I could easily handle with some ginger tea.
39	341	Everyday I took Yaz I fell sick with nausea and couldn't do much of anything without the fear of throwing up.
39	342	I'm hopeful that the nausea will go away soon because it's impacted my daily activities.
39	343	No nausea or anything.
39	344	I had a nausea, I was feeling very weak, I was fatigue and super sleepy all the time.
39	345	After two weeks, nausea was gone.
39	346	I have severe abdominal pains and nausea.
39	347	The very first pill I took gave me nausea but that was it.
39	348	I always had a little nausea, but Yaz was the first pill to make me vomit.
39	349	I'm happy again and wake up motivated, so far the only side effect has been a little breast tenderness and nausea.
39	350	My heart is always racing, and I also feel nauseated so easily.
39	351	I have been nauseated for 7 days and have resulted to taking Zofran (ondanestron) 4 times so that I could eat food.
39	352	Yaz made me nauseated daily and my mood went from being a happy bright personality to a moody tired personality.
39	353	The smell of food makes me immediately nauseous but I haven't allowed it to let me puke.
39	354	Anyway,  with the Yaz the first 1-2 months I was exhausted, dizzy, nauseous, sense of smell and taste were heightened, almost felt like early pregnancy signs.
39	355	I've noticed I can't drink the pill on a empty stomach (otherwise I am really nauseous).
39	356	I feel nauseous at least 30 minutes a day and now that I've gotten my period it's gotten 10x worse.
39	357	Upon requesting a Yaz prescription from my doctor, I was initially concerned as I was very nauseous and threw-up a few times in the morning during the first week.
39	358	I would rather pay $60 a month for YAZ than to be on all the other pills that made me extremely moody, anxious and nauseous.
39	359	I was nauseous and felt off balance.
39	360	I also have cravings, and get super nauseous at the thought of certain foods.
39	361	I get super dizzy from anemia at work now.
39	362	In the first month or so I had mild side effects-felt a bit dizzy and had some breakthrough bleeding, but they subsided after a month or two.
39	363	I do get dizzy, it's happened twice only.
39	364	Had major mood swings , abusive towards people I care about.
39	365	Hi, I have been on Yaz for five months and I have suffered really bad with chest pain, mood swings, anxiety, really dark thoughts , feeling of ugliness, no concentration, bad sleep,  feeling that I was pregnant , no periods at all.
39	366	My mood swings were CRAZY.
39	367	This was not the right pill for me—although I didn’t gain any weight or had other side effects the mood swings I experienced were SHOCKING.
39	368	I’m noticing my mood swings are going from 0-10 really quick, my poor boyfriend has also noticed.
39	369	Although I was completely fine the first two months, I’m on Day 7 of the third pack and my mood swings this month have been horrible.
39	370	I even think I’m crazy during my mood swings.
39	371	I'm normally pretty mellow (low moments from time to time, nothing crazy) but I've noticed that since taking it again, epic mood swings set off by the tiniest things.
39	372	It made my periods lighter and shorter, and not as painful; I have no side effects or mood swings; my skin is clearer, and I haven't added any weight because of it.
39	373	My mood swings have toned down so much I forgot what it was like to be this calm.
39	374	I had no depression or mood swings outside the normal period mood swings.
39	375	I had mood swings and was pretty emotional for the first 2 months but it really has gone away.
39	376	I broke out, had severe mood swings, I'd cry for no reason.
39	377	After a few weeks, I experienced EXTREME mood swings.
39	378	The mood swings are also discouraging.
39	379	I have also experienced extreme mood swings, crying over nothing, getting depressed over silly things that never used to effect me at all.
39	380	I am less irritable, less anxious, and my mood swings are gone.
39	381	The big problem I have are my mood swings.
39	382	It helped with my horrible mood swings.
39	383	Almost ruined my relationship with my mood swings, neediness and constant breakdowns.
39	384	My husband noticed my mood swings and said I seem to be overall less enthusiastic about life.
39	385	I had the worst mood swings on Yaz.
39	386	I had horrible mood swings, I was depressed, I didn't have any interest in my job or friends, and I just wanted to die.
39	387	I was put on Yaz for my choice of birth control and mood swings.
39	388	When I first started taking Yaz I noticed MUCH lighter and shorter periods, no noticeable weight gain/loss, no mood swings or craving.
39	389	I switched to YAZ from Ortho Tri-Cyclen lo because Ortho was causing me major mood swings.
39	390	YAZ took care of the mood swings, I have virtually none on YAZ, but it came with other side effects.
39	391	A little over two years on it though, I slowly started getting mood swings back.
39	392	I had horrible mood swings and cried about everything.
39	393	The first couple of months I took this I had some mood swings and felt rather emotional but that went away.
39	394	The reason why I picked, and like this medication is because it doesn't give me mood swings, which every other birth control always causes.
39	395	With Yaz I had clear skin, no mood swings, I loved it.
39	396	I never know when or if I'm going to get my period and my poor husband has had to deal with my mood swings.
39	397	No abnormal things happening like mood swings or hairloss like other are experiencing.
39	398	Im always in a constant state of anxiety and depression, im nervous all the time and generally feel like someone has just died.
39	399	I was nervous to start Yaz.
39	400	I was on Yaz for 2 months and started to become anxious, paranoid, and depreesed.
39	401	I started to be anxious and insecure immediately.
39	402	A week before my period I went into full anxious and depression mode.
39	403	I was on it for 2 months and got extremely moody, emotional, anxious, and tired.
39	404	I started feeling insecure, anxious, paranoid and started believing and accusing him of not being into me and got mad at him at little things.
39	405	I was anxious and short tempered I even became violent towards my husband for absolutely no reason.
39	406	I generally do feel anxious without the pill, although I have been feeling depressed recently, and it's dreadful
39	407	Ive been on meds, gone to counselling and nothings worked.Ive only been taking Yaz for a few days but within an hour of taking it on the first day I went from feeling anxious to totally calm, is this what it's like to feel normal?.
39	408	I am super anxious about very little things.
39	409	I am a very happy and charismatic person but now I feel anxious all the time, I'm sensitive over things that wouldn't bother me at all before.
39	410	Made me very emotional and anxious, I felt like I was going crazy.
39	411	Day 2 I would cry for no reason and felt anxious all day, if I wasn't crying it was because I was distracting myself from the bad thoughts that kept creeping up on me.
39	412	I was on the pill called Diane when I was in my early 20s and found that it made me anxious and depressed.
39	413	On a positive note, it made me feel a lot less anxious than Loestrin 24 FE did.
39	414	I've been on Yaz for about a year and a half and I really like it except that sometimes my periods are so light, short or non-existent, that I get anxious wondering if I'm pregnant.
39	415	On the Alesse I realize I felt really anxious and didn't even consider it was the pill until I took Yaz.
39	416	I cry at the drop of a hat and I'm really anxious.
39	417	I have never experienced anxiety prior to taking this birth control and I have had multiple intense panic attacks within the past month.
39	418	22 year old with a history of anxiety, and have found absolutely no issues with Yaz.
39	419	Migraine was so severe and depression and anxiety made me feel restless.
39	420	I also had extreme anxiety.
39	421	Im prone to anxiety, but my depression and anxiety have sky-rocketed, I feel completely hopeless and have panic attacks every day.
39	422	Ive been anxiety and depression free for 3 days now.so im thinking the cause of this anxiety was a hormonal or chemical imbalance that yaz has regulated?
39	423	Since I've been taking YAZ I gone from mild to severe depression, anxiety attacks, uncontrolled bouts of crying, panic attacks and now I may have first signs of glaucoma.
39	424	I knew that before my period I would get sad for no reason, feel unmotivated, and my anxiety would rise.
39	425	Almost immediately after I changed from Qlaira to Yaz I noticed my anxiety levels rising, I'm not one to constantly worry and have always had this joy for life, but not since taking Yaz.
39	426	I started Yaz just for birth control and because I had having a lot of anxiety and my doctor thought it may help along with my anxiety meds.
39	427	Day 1 on Yaz I started to have anxiety and panic attacks about every little thing.
39	428	I started Yaz and immediately noticed my anxiety levels go through the roof, particularly within the first two hours of taking it.
39	429	By the 3rd year though I developed severe anxiety, depression and mild kidney and liver problems as well as a racing pounding pulse and difficulty breathing.
39	430	My anxiety decreased and blood sugar leveled.
39	431	It has caused me to have extreme anxiety, gain weight, and severe depression.
39	432	I had very tender breasts and a light two-week period for the first month.
39	433	And I have very tender, dense, sore breasts that I can't sleep on my stomach anymore.
39	434	My breasts grew a full cup size (plus), BUT Yaz gave me a yeast infection for four months and made me gain ten pounds.
40	1	I was put on birth control 1x in high school (pill) for acne.
40	2	The copper IUD has NO SIDE EFFECTS besides cramping and increased bleeding, people who experience hair loss, acne, mood issues, etc... are more than likely suffering from transitioning off of hormonal BC, since there are NO HORMONES in the Copper IUD.
40	3	Anywhom I am 23 and recently decided to date again & wanted to have a convinient birth control that won't affect my weight or cause acne since acne has recently been a new battle for me, so my first step was hitting the Internet for options.
40	4	(Since I was 14) which included horrible mood swings, severe acne break outs, decreased interest in sex, and even hair loss!
40	5	PMS symptoms before period but no spotting, yay normally get a lot of acne on chin!
40	6	Overall, heavier periods, but no weight gain, no acne, no pregnancy.
40	7	I was having problem with hormonal bc making me depressed, angry, breaking out and high blood pressure.
40	8	The only things I dislike about paragard are the heavy periods, cramps, and spotting.
40	9	I had never had bad cramps until my IUD.
40	10	The first couple periods with the copper IUD were pretty intense with cramps and heavy bleeding- however, as each month goes by my periods have started to return to normal.
40	11	The first few months, my cramps were a bit stronger, but nothing I couldn't function normally through; flow was also a bit stronger, but again, nothing I couldn't function normally through.
40	12	For the following 6 months I had the heaviest periods I have ever experienced & the worst cramps.
40	13	The cramps and the heavy flow have slowly gotten better since then.
40	14	I was terrified for it but just felt like really strong period cramps.
40	15	Yes, my cramps are crazy and I bleed a lot more when I'm on my period (I also get some mild cramping leading up to my period) but I find all of this manageable.
40	16	pills in an attempt to control my cramps.
40	17	Periods lasted 12 days + on this and the cramps were so painful I would end up complaining about them.
40	18	I've now had the IUD for over two weeks and I have to say so far so good bar cramps that come and go.
40	19	But apart from the cramps and discharge, it's been great.
40	20	I had a bit of crampyness for 3-4 days but ibuprofen helped a lot and I have now had the IUD for a year and the periods have gotten better and the cramps have gotten less and less worse each time.
40	21	I felt like I had period cramps for an hour or so afterwards but haven't needed more of the ponstan yet, fingers crossed.
40	22	The cramps come and go but I started my period the very next day after it being inserted so I cannot comment on how long the bleeding has lasted or anything.
40	23	Period doesn't seem any heavier but the cramps are much worse.
40	24	My periods are heavier and cramps are slightly worse but nothing I can't handle.
40	25	Its only been one day, but I am still in a lot of pain from cramps.
40	26	Yes, insertion hurt with several really bad cramps, but that only lasted about 10 minutes and I had forgotten to take ibrupofen ahead of time.
40	27	The cramps started to ease up that night.
40	28	Mild cramps did continue off and on with some spotting for the next few days then stopped.
40	29	Insertion of the copper coil was uncomfortable and will give you painful cramps.
40	30	Lower back pain, painful cramps, period that lasts 2 weeks where I bleed through super tampons in two hours, and spotting for the other 2 weeks.
40	31	Crouching down for longer then 30 seconds as well as sitting on hard chairs means having painful cramps for the day.
40	32	I went right back to work after placement but you may want to take the day off just to relax as you will have bad cramps.
40	33	The first week I had heavy cramps and spotting- heating pads help a ton.
40	34	By week two the cramps will taper off.
40	35	The cramps have woken me up out my sleep numerous times, cramping after intercourse, heavy bleeding, period lasting 2 or more weeks.
40	36	Now about 6 months later my period is completely normal and only have normal mild cramps during the first day.
40	37	Driving home I had bad cramps.
40	38	The next day I went to work and just took one ibuprofen to alleviate my super mild cramps.
40	39	Had intercourse Thursday, no string felt by husband, no cramps nothing.
40	40	I did go a day after my menstrual cycle, and had minor cramps through out the day, but it wasn't bad.
40	41	My first menstrual cycle was really heavy with painful cramps and huge blood clots it lasted about nine days, but my second menstrual cycle was horrible the bleeding was heavy and as of today I've been bleeding for 26 days and it is still going.
40	42	However it gave me the most painful cramps one can imagine.
40	43	I had mild cramps for 2 hours after and light spotting for a few days.
40	44	My mom recommended it because she's used it for years for her and my dad ...my cramps are a little more hurtful but before paraguard they hurted bad enough to take pain pills anyways.
40	45	The insertion itself wasn't too painful, but afterwards for a good 12 hours I experienced what felt like severe cramps and I unfortunately had to go through it twice.
40	46	My cramps are a little bad but other than that I give nothing but good reviews for this .
40	47	Now my periods are 10-15 days with spotting in between, moderate cramps several days before, and through the duration of my period.
40	48	I thought  my periods were going to be awful and that I would have bad cramps and bleeding would be really heavy.
40	49	I have a little cramping while on my period but the worst cramps are about a week before my cycle and a few days after.
40	50	There was spotting for about two days but no cramps.
40	51	I have also had terrible cramping previous to getting the paragard, I would be in bed for 2 days so they really tried to sway me against the copper iud as it usually makes periods sorer and heavier- unbelievably it has taken my cramps almost completely away.
40	52	Pain is like abdominal and vaginal cramps that are 7/10 scale.
40	53	I had three major cramps during the procedure and then it was over.
40	54	Monthly period cramps so far are, I won't lie, really bad but that's also worth it as you can take aspirin and not feel a thing afterwards.
40	55	All in all I feel it was the best choice because I don't have bleeding any other time then my period and no other cramps, so there's time for fun always with my love!
40	56	Today the cramps were so bad that I doubled over in pain and was brought to tears.
40	57	Afterwards I had cramps a little, not too bad until 3 days later my boyfriend and I had sex (we waited the 3 days we were told) lol worst idea ever.
40	58	First 4 months of my period were pretty rough, cramps were worse than they were beforehand (which were pretty bad already) but fought through them.
40	59	Like I said, it was moderately painful cramping, much like the cramps I had as a teenager and my spotting was so light that I used lite tampons throughout the day.
40	60	About 15 minutes afterward I had some nasty cramps and pain set in, the ibuprofen did not really help but the heating pad has been somewhat helpful.
40	61	I napped a bit and the cramps are now subsiding, so I hope they stay that way!
40	62	The insertion was painful (like labor cramps) but only for a couple seconds.
40	63	My cramps felt more like contractions.
40	64	I was scare because they told me that i was going to get heavier and painfull periods but so far so good everything great i do have cramps but normal as i just to get them and heavier just a little more.
40	65	My second one caused me nothing but trouble...periods for 10 days with spotting / random days in between; stomach cramps all the way through the month; sex was painful for both my partner and I, and I'd coil up in agony afterwards and would bleed pretty much every time.
40	66	My period was actually better with no cramps.
40	67	I did have really bad cramps one time during sex like labor pains almost for about 10 mins, not sure if it has to do anything with the iud.
40	68	It didn't hurt as I was expecting either, just a few cramps an hour afterwards.
40	69	As I have read the period cramps are supposed to worsen and I'm definitely not looking forward to that, so hopefully it won't be so bad.
40	70	It took about 3 minutes-- during which i experienced two very sharp deep cramps.
40	71	The cramps came in waves for about an hour-- was difficult to drive home.
40	72	Had to take 6 Aleve and can still slightly feel the cramps.
40	73	Now, I am used to having pretty bad cramps during the first two days of my period but the cramps I have experienced with this are on another level.
40	74	Okay,  I'm 25, never been on bc before, typically a 5 day period, never experienced period cramps, pretty high pain threshold.
40	75	Hormonal birth just didn't work for me I was on nexplanon but it made me crazy also caused crazy yeast infections, so I have the ParaGuard a shot, when I went in to get it done the only thing that really hurt was the thing they used to clamp ur cervix but there was cramping but bare able but I just finished my period but there was a lot of blood like everywhere I didn't even know but right after just some spotting a little bit of cramps this is day 2 no cramps or anything feel no different which is good but I heard a lot of different thing I really hope this works out will update later on
40	76	I have very high pain tolerance and experience the typical first two days of horror on my cycle, so these cramps aren't foreign to me.
40	77	I never had cramps prior to the IUD.
40	78	cramps every month prior to period and still present a yr in.
40	79	And in the last five hours I've had maybe one or two cramps.
40	80	The cramps sometimes impede my daily life, but generally only for a day or two before my period starts.
40	81	Overall, not having to think about birth control, not feeling it during intercourse, and being protected for 10 years FAR outweighs the cramps and bleeding, in my opinion!
40	82	With each interval the cramps got worse and worse.
40	83	I have cramps constantly
40	84	I have horrible cramps and my tolerance for pain is high.
40	85	I had some mild cramps and one sharp cramp that made me catch my breath but it was over in minutes.
40	86	Mild cramps the next day too.
40	87	I was assuming that for one I was going to have a longer period once they inserted my IUD (it actually stopped the next morning and it was like it wasn't even in there) and then now, I just started my period today and I have NO cramps, I had no clue I was even starting.
40	88	Periods are a bit heavier than before and only slightly crampy, I never had cramps before the IUD.
40	89	The first time I had it I did not feel any pain with insertion, only cramps afterwards.
40	90	After the procedure, I did not have and still have not had any cramps... only some brown discharge (but very minimal).
40	91	The para guard  insertion was a breeze my period was normally for 5 days now it's 7 days and 2 out of the 3 days are really heavy but I do not have any cramps !!!!
40	92	Most cases when pregnancy or terrible inflammation and cramps happen is because of improper placement so make sure your doctor has done At least 50.
40	93	I still feel slight period cramps here and there especially when I'm in need of a bowel movement!
40	94	No heavy period, each period is 3-5 days, no cramps, sex life is better, no weight gain, highly recommend it if you're not trying to have a baby within the next 2 years!
40	95	Bleeding and cramps.
40	96	I get cramps usually a day before my period and they last no more than 10 seconds but they are pretty painful when they come and go!
40	97	I've read on other sites that orgasms can actually help with cramps!
40	98	Just started my first period since insertion and I've never had cramps this painful in my life.
40	99	I never got cramps on the pill and my periods lasted roughly 3 days.
40	100	With the IUD Ive had only two periods lasting 7-12 days which have been super heavy with horrible cramps and nausea.
40	101	Couldn't sleep the first two nights from having horrible cramps.
40	102	I get cramps randomly through out the day.
40	103	After, it was uncomfortable and the cramps were so bad.
40	104	But I didn't mind since my usual periods consist of painful cramps.
40	105	Like cramps from friggin hell.
40	106	I was lucky of not having any cramps because my cervix was numb.
40	107	However, the cramps are a little rough.
40	108	Before IUD, I had no cramps, four day periods (light bleeding) and no yeast infections.
40	109	Menstrual cramps are sometimes blinding and my periods usually last about 8 to 9 days now with 3/4 days of heavy bleeding.
40	110	The first 6+ months were hell, 2 periods a month and insane cramps.
40	111	I've had period cramps that have been much worse than that.
40	112	The pain felt like an intense cramp for a few minutes and then some random cramps throughout the day.
40	113	Bleeding hasn't increased and cramps are none existent.
40	114	I was dizzy that day, and so far I've had minimal spotting for a week, and light cramps every once in a while.
40	115	Been having cramps but I think this is normal feeling like before I was on hbc.
40	116	Nausea, dizziness, fatigue, horrible labor-like cramps in my uterus and back.
40	117	The cramps felt like hell on earth.
40	118	Since I was 18 after the insertion I experience ugly cramps but with midol they went away.
40	119	When the first period with the IUD arrived, I wasn't able to move the two first day due to the horrible cramps.
40	120	Two, quick intense period cramps that each last about 10 seconds.
40	121	Two hours afterward I still feel ok, slight cramps here and there but nothing like my cramps I normally get while on my period.
40	122	After the insertion I had really really bad cramps,I was told that I was in so much pain because I've never had a child.
40	123	The insertion was NOT fun, but it only took about 5 minutes and my periods have stayed the same except for a little bit worse cramps.
40	124	There were two main sensations of pain that just felt like baf period cramps and then soon subsided after 30 seconds or so.
40	125	I was directed I would have light cramping and spotting for a few days after but I'm already on my period so no big deal and I don't feel any cramps yet will update you on how it goes.
40	126	My only issue with it is that my periods are very heavy and my cramps are strong.
40	127	If these cramps go away within the next week I think this was totally worth it for ten years of not having to worry about it.
40	128	My period was neither heavier nor longer than usual and my cramps seemed to be no worse than before Paragard.
40	129	Yes it increased bleeding and cramps during my period, but it has been manageable.
40	130	Within the last year I've even noticed a decrease :) Insertion was a shot of pain during and cramps afterward.
40	131	My only "complaints" are the cramps are at time excruciating!
40	132	The reason for this is because your cervix is already softened(dialated) and is easier to put the iud in(which makes it less painful lol)I only had it for 3 days now and the only thing is my cramps are a little bit more crampy.
40	133	I know it sounds gross but trust me..you will barely feel any pain and taking some medicine for the cramps will help
40	134	The worst part about it is the cramps.
40	135	I had mild to non-existent cramps prior to getting the IUD, but the cramps that came along with my first period not only started earlier but were really painful.
40	136	Although I did have very light cramps the rest of the day but nothing extremely painful.
40	137	The cramps vary from being manageable with ibuprofen to nothing being able to touch them.
40	138	I did have mild cramps the rest of the day-but a heating pad and more Midol did the trick.
40	139	The next day I had cramps in the morning and I was fine the rest of the day.
40	140	The only thing I felt for the first 4 hours were cramps.
40	141	Then I was done bleeding a little bit bled heavily for a couple days, cramps.
40	142	When my paragard got inserted, it felt like bad period cramps.
40	143	Now that it's pretty regular, it lasts between 5-6 days and the most surprising thing is I have no cramps at all.
40	144	In fact, my cramps and PMS were worse when I was on the pill.
40	145	So far very happy with it, I had a day of cramping when it was put in, since then, very minimal cramps - I think my body is just getting used to it.
40	146	The insertion was a little painful because I've never had children and the next few days I experienced moderate to severe cramps.
40	147	My cramps severely intensified to the point of being unbearable, and I had two yeast infections in the two years I've had it, compared to the none I had before.
40	148	I typically don't post, but I thought I should share.. if you have cramps on your normal menstrual cycle, the cramps only get worse.
40	149	I experienced severe menstrual cramps, 10/10 pain.
40	150	Back to normal cramps.
40	151	For me, the day I got it I had pretty damn bad cramps, but by the next day they were nonexistent.
40	152	About a week before my period I was getting cramps here and there - nothing Tylenol couldn't take care of.
40	153	I do have some cramps with it, but nothing like I have experienced in the past.
40	154	The doctor was great and she finished within 10 minutes, I felt 2 cramps, and I was fine after I left.
40	155	Having it put in was painful, the cramps following insertion have been awful, and the dizziness is insane.
40	156	I have bad cramps during my cycle and heavy periods.
40	157	I do get cramps before, during, and after my period but I know that is not the case for everybody.
40	158	For me, the peace of mind is worth the trade off for the cramps.
40	159	But I can no longer work out, as even simple mat work gives me horrible cramps.
40	160	The cramps following insertion were awful, I'd rank them as a 7/10.
40	161	The entire first month I had almost constant cramps.
40	162	The cramps were so bad.
40	163	It did not cause me to have heavier periods or make my cramps worse.
40	164	My period is definitely a little heavier, nothing major though and I still don't cramp during my period.
40	165	It was a severe cramp straight away and the rest of the day I lay on the sofa in tears.
40	166	I felt a slight cramp, that's it!
40	167	I barely cramp.
40	168	I remember the insertion hurt like a bad cramp with a shooting pain down my leg for all of two seconds and bam done.
40	169	Insertion felt like a dull cramp, as if my uterus was being tugged.
40	170	And I've never been one to cramp and I cramp now.
40	171	If you can handle a period you can handle this.. its just a period cramp for less than ten seconds and done.
40	172	I cramp bad during ovulation and period.
40	173	Like many others say...it's an intense cramp...but if you focus on breathing deep it is literally over in 2 breaths.
40	174	A very mild cramp and it was over.
40	175	I had one minor cramp that went away right after insertion.
40	176	The pain of the initial measuring of the cervix/uterus was like a mild period cramp, and then soon the iud insertion followed was still like a mild cramp.
40	177	The major cramp started and lasted about 5 minutes.
40	178	Then used a clamp which was uncomfortable she then jaged me with LA this did  give me cramp on my lower abdomen she then inserted a long white tube which again was uncomfortable and caused some cramp it wasn't sore though.
40	179	I am on the second day of my period and all I felt was a small cramp.
40	180	That felt like a strong cramp and it made me tense up a bit.
40	181	Now, I cramp at the start of ovulation through the entirety of my menstruation.
40	182	Insertion was not horrible (I've never had kids)-it felt like a big cramp and it was over with quickly!
40	183	I do not take birth control--but, instead, use cramp bark to help relieve the pain.
40	184	Insertion was one terrible cramp, but otherwise fine.
40	185	Just a super bad period cramp some sharp pain and over 5 minutes.
40	186	Yes there is cramping during insertion.
40	187	Light periods & no cramping were a plus but I was growing into an elephant (getting fat).
40	188	It's worth the cramping and spotting.
40	189	Honestly, if you are used to having painful cramping, you will not be greatly affected by the insertion.
40	190	I had cramping for about a week after insertion and since then everything has pretty much been fine.
40	191	I've been cramping moderately off and on all afternoon and I've only felt like laying in bed watching netflix but to me a little while of uncomfortable tolerable pain is well worth it for 10 years of pregnancy prevention.
40	192	I haven't experienced any cramping afterward either but small spotting due to the procedure.
40	193	So I got the copper coil fitted on the 22nd of May 2017 just a few days ago I am 25 and haven't had any kids I decided to get a copper because my body doesn't agree with hormones I must say insertion was the most painful experience of my life I nearly passed out but I didn't take any painkillers or get my cervix softened before hand after that I was okay it's been three days now and I've only had slight cramping and n some brownish spotting I suffer severe GAD so was paranoid in getting this but it's my only option I hope it all goes well for me no my body agrees with it will post back on a update in a few weeks I haven't had sex with my partner yet and my period is due so see what happens fingers crossed this works out okay
40	194	The next few days were light spotting and manageable cramping.
40	195	I had VERY heavy periods (which I've never had in my life) for ten days with terrible cramping.
40	196	After a few months of heavy periods and cramping I got BV (which I've also never had before).
40	197	I also would had sudden cramping that would cause me to bend over in pain.
40	198	Painkillers during period days did the trick and the cramping eased off.
40	199	Insertion was uncomfortable, yet not painful to me and my cramping was minimal and lasted about through the evening.
40	200	Mild cramping that day, but I went home and could still live life just fine (I did laundry and made dinner).
40	201	No increased cramping, or other side effects.
40	202	I have about 2 periods a month, I'm always tired, the cramping in one side is excruciating
40	203	Or cramping or spotting.
40	204	A few hours later cramping, bleeding and a dull back ache.
40	205	Today is day 5, I do hope the cramping subsides.
40	206	I had mild cramping for a few days and then spotting for about a week and a pretty heavy flow (I'm usually very light).
40	207	Now that my period is over I have maybe slight cramping once in a while but no spotting anymore.
40	208	I had some cramping after!
40	209	The sound and insertion caused slight cramping, but nothing serious.
40	210	I had a little cramping and heavier bleeding (I was still bleeding some PP).
40	211	Light pink bleeding after and little cramping.
40	212	After she inserted it I felt nauseous from the pain and felt cramping afterward.
40	213	Worst cramping I've ever felt.
40	214	my periods are heavy I'm lucky to not have cramping on my IUD but man I had really heavy period for 3 weeks.
40	215	Two hours later, I'm having some minor cramping but a heating pad help and Tylenol is helping.
40	216	Lots of cramping last night and a bit yoday, just feels like I'm about to start my cycle.
40	217	Major, unbearable cramping... To the point where I'm crying...
40	218	I expected the longer heavier periods (7-8 days) and cramping but it is just unbearable at this point.
40	219	If you have had children or moderate cramping during your period, having the Paragard inserted is a walk in the park.
40	220	Had minor cramping for about a week or so.
40	221	Slight cramping but pain killers worked & 2weeks in I felt nothing.
40	222	A few hrs later Aleve wore off and painful cramping in abdomen and in lower back came on full forse.
40	223	I was pleasantly surprised that it was quick and had only very slight cramping.
40	224	After that, there was some mildly irritating cramping the rest of the day, but nothing horrible.
40	225	Initially had some cramping....
40	226	Insertion hurt, like the worst rippling cramping you'll ever experience.
40	227	Insertion was not bad at all for me, a tiny bit of cramping and then the worst of that was the cramping became a bit more severe when I got home and into the next day.
40	228	I have never been one to have very heavy/irregular  periods or heavy cramping and since I have gotten paragard I have had the most irregular, heavy periods of my life and the cramping has been unbearable at times.
40	229	One week no bleeding no cramping nothing I was feeling normal again.
40	230	Only had minor cramping and all in all very satisfied
40	231	I was told that I would be bleeding and cramping for a few days.
40	232	I have some period type cramping and spotting for a few days and everything was fine, I even went for a run on day 3 after the fitting.
40	233	I had some pretty decent cramping directly after.
40	234	I got up and went to target to see how I felt walking around, I had some cramping after walking around.
40	235	(with no issues) Day 3 no bleeding, light cramping.
40	236	Day 4 (today) no bleeding or cramping.
40	237	I had severe cramping from three weeks after insertion, then experience contraction like cramping about 20 days out of the month.
40	238	I am only 2 months in and my body is still getting used to it ie - copper smell, spotting and longer periods and cramping.
40	239	I had cramping off and on the rest of the day but nothing terrible.
40	240	After the insertion I bled for almost two weeks with mild cramping.
40	241	I did feel just a little cramping afterwards which lasted about and hour or so.
40	242	My cramping was so unbearable I would keel over in pain 1 week before my period during my period and 1 week  after not to mention that my periods were extremely heavy I would go through a 30 pack of "jumbo"
40	243	I did have heavy period, like 5 days of solid bleeding, but no cramping or pain.
40	244	No cramping afterwards either.
40	245	Now the cramping afterwards was there but not too terrible and I think it was there because my uterus went through 25mins of trauma.
40	246	I had severe cramping randomly and daily.
40	247	It subsided hours later although I woke up in the night with mild cramping again.
40	248	I had cooper IUD inserted yesterday, I felt slight cramping as he placed it literally took 10 seconds!
40	249	I decided to discontinue this because the cramping I have is becoming unbearable.
40	250	I have cramping 3 out of 4 weeks and I have to take 4x 800mg ibuprofen.
40	251	Before I had my period for 3-4 days and would have bad cramping for one day that could be fixed by taking 1-2 500mg tylnenol tablets.
40	252	There was some intense cramping during the "sound" and the actual insertion, but it took less than five minutes, and there was no pain, but slight discomfort, for the rest of the day.
40	253	As my doctor placed the speculum I had some discomfort, she had trouble finding my cervix, after some time she had everything positioned right and began to try and dilate my cervix, right when she started I began to feel extreme cramping.
40	254	She attempted a few more times until I couldn't take the pain anymore because the cramping became so severe I began to cry.
40	255	Now I know i sound ridiculous crying but I have a pretty high tolerance for pain & I never understood how many woman couldn't take the cramping they had when on their period because I don't experience cramping on my periods, at least until now.
40	256	Then my period came 1 week early just 4 days after I got my IUD placed, it was very heavy the first 3 days with medium cramping and my period lasted 5 1/2 days.
40	257	I have not had any cramping since my period and my discharge has reduced.
40	258	Insertion wasn't that bad, slight cramping but otherwise fine.
40	259	I had it removed because I started having recurring yeast infections every month (3 months straight), extreme cramping during my period, random bleeding, discharge, and spotting, I would bleed for two weeks at a time, bleeding during sex, dizziness, and my periods were extremely heavy (soaking through a pad every hour.)
40	260	I was luckily one of the ones that did not have cramping or spotting afterward.
40	261	My periods have mostly normalized and I only get a few days of bad cramping now.
40	262	No cramping at all and the blood was so mild that it didn't even fill a panty liner.
40	263	There is some very light spotting, and barely noticeable cramping.
40	264	No cramping but I do get dizzy sometimes, that can be the iuf bringing my iron lower then it already is.
40	265	The cramping got worse but stopped after a short nap and I felt mild cramping throughout the rest of my cycle.
40	266	I have had 2 kids and thought that the insertion process was no worse than bad cramping.
40	267	However 20 mins after inserestion i did start getting bleeding and cramping about and hour or so later this settled down and i was aware of the bleeding still but the cramping wasn't to bad and came and went.
40	268	Yes, it was very painful putting it in and had several days of severe cramping.
40	269	I still get monthly periods, the first few months I had extremely painful cramping but with some ibuprofen it took the edge off.
40	270	For the past 2 days I have had cramping that comes and goes all day long and still having some spotting here and there, I am hoping this cramping stops soon as they are more intense then what I am used to with my period.
40	271	Some mild period - like cramping after.
40	272	I had minor cramping for about an hour afterwards I will write again in a month or so to say how it's been.
40	273	I'm experiencing some mild cramping and light spotting, but nothing that a little Motrin can't fix.
40	274	It turned out to be painless, besides some moment of pressure and cramping.
40	275	Take some pain relief before hand if you're worried and after as the cramping can be pretty bad.
40	276	The pain subsided very quickly and I only had period like cramping for the rest of the day.
40	277	After the cramping levelled out,everything seems to be good.
40	278	I bleed for 8 days, terrible cramping and bloating, I I need to change a super tampon every other hours on the worst day, it is awful.
40	279	I didn't experience any major cramping the rest of the day or the next day.
40	280	I did feel extreme cramping after the procedure.
40	281	Minor cramping since then nothing some pain meds can't take care of.
40	282	It took some time to get used to because I used to have light periods and rare cramping.
40	283	My Dr says the first 3-5 periods will be hard for example heavier bleeding and cramping because the IUD is trying to settle in.
40	284	When I had it put in there was a little bit of pain and some really heavy cramping for the first 2 nights but overall I am very happy with it!
40	285	I was so so scared before I got it after reading reviews about insertion pain, bleeding, cramping, etc...
40	286	My cramping is a bit different--more piercing--but not unmanageable.
40	287	Getting the IUD in was uncomfortable and there was cramping afterwards but nothing I couldn't handle and I have a low pain tolerance.
40	288	Also on that note my cramping didn't get worse not my flow.
40	289	A bit of cramping the next two days.
40	290	About 20 minutes after insertion the cramping has subsided and I don't feel as awful as I thought I would.
40	291	Mild cramping but that's about it.
40	292	The cramping during insertion was unpleasant I would say a 6 out of 10.
40	293	With the IUD I bleed heavy for 3-5 days with minimal cramping.
40	294	The actual insertion did not hurt at all, there was cramping that hurt when she measures my cervix which was painful but lasted all of 10 seconds.
40	295	I would highly recommend getting someone to drive you to the doctors/hospital as I felt very faint and dizzy afterwards and thought I qas going to vomit, I've had it in 12hrs now and the cramping was severe afterwards (heat pack and naprogesic work a treat!)
40	296	And ibuprofen is necessary when I'm cramping from my period/ovulation.
40	297	Now my periods are longer and heavier and sometimes I have cramping, but those are the only side effects I have.
40	298	I had horrific cramping and bleeding that whole day, an unreal amount of bleeding that night (seriously), but then the next day just a tiny bit of cramping and bleeding.
40	299	My periods are slightly heavier than they were before, my cramping is normal, and my period lasts about 5 days.
40	300	Today was much much better, still some cramping with high activity and I took it easy all day.
40	301	I had mild cramping the first week after insertion but now I'm back to myself 100% & feel great (no cramps/spotting).
40	302	I was nervous about periods and cramping but I can honestly say that my periods - have had two now - have been just about normal (maybe a bit heavier but nothing like described).
40	303	I have had some cramping but nothing major.
40	304	The cramping was extreme but I can honestly say that it was worth it.
40	305	Also, The pain of the cramping will be a little more intense for 6 months afterwards.
40	306	The peace of mind is worth the cramping.
40	307	I also have cramping and bleeding between periods and feel bloated most of the time.
40	308	After it was complete I did have some cramping in my abdomen and got the dizzy spells.
40	309	Ibuprofen took care of the cramping and as for the dizzy spells, that lasted about 4-5 hours.
40	310	The next day I has some mild cramping again but the ibuprofen took care of that again, and I didn't get dizzy.
40	311	After having the IUD inserted at planned parenthood, which the insertion was a bit crampy but I was fine afterwards.
40	312	My periods initially were very crampy (sharp pains), heavy, and longer than normal.
40	313	Sometimes I get crampy after sex, but nothing too bad.
40	314	I was really crampy that night and a little bit that day.
40	315	I still get much more painful crampy periods, but that is diminishing.
40	316	I recommend just wearing pads everyday as spotting and bleeding was unpredictable the first month.
40	317	I've been spotting since.
40	318	On September 1st, I got spotting that wasn't normal for me, then a week later got what I thought would be my normal period.
40	319	My periods were very heavy and unpleasant, I had constant spotting as well.
40	320	I experienced bleeding and spotting for the first 2-3 weeks which was annoying but has completely disappeared.
40	321	The last two periods I've had very minimal sharp pains (only at the start of it), and it lasted 2 days normal with a couple days spotting.
40	322	By Wednesday I was sprinting on the treadmill, spotting completely gone.
40	323	I suffer from severe headaches, I feel like u talk very slow and feel mentally slow, I keep bleeding heavy not spotting and I have blood clots associated with it.. Also, I have rosaeca and it made my rosacea act up.
40	324	I didn't experience any pain after only heavy periods and a little spotting that went back to normal the following month.
40	325	No spotting or bleeding yet.
40	326	I drove home, slight spotting but that's it.
40	327	I decided to switch birth controls, I overall didn't mind the iud's , I got the paraguard on 02-29-2016 , I noticed spotting for the first 3 days then I was ok.
40	328	I also had some spotting in between periods.
40	329	A little bit of spotting the first day but nothing since.
40	330	Maybe some brown spotting at first then, light bleeding.
40	331	Bled steadily for a month after insertion, then a month of nothing, and then a month of spotting on and off but since then only occasional spotting.
40	332	Downside was my period lasted 12 days and had spotting.
40	333	I am spotting a bit but nothing that will soak a liner.
40	334	I get some pains here and there and spotting at random times.
40	335	I am spotting but very minimal.
40	336	I have now had my IUD going on 3 weeks and I have little spotting every day so I use liners all the time.
40	337	Do expect some spotting for about 6 weeks.
40	338	My periods have been a bit irregular and have had spotting almost daily since my insertion, but I read that it is expected.
40	339	So far I have no pain not discomfort just the light spotting and irregular periods.
40	340	I had some spotting.
40	341	The procedure was painless for me except for a sting/pinch, maybe for me it was painless because of previous births and I also was spotting which the doctor said would make it easier.
40	342	Apart from some light spotting which is normal, I feel completely back to normal now and I'm thrilled that I've had it fitted.
40	343	Warning: bring a pad with you as it goes into effect immediately and if you're ovulating this causes spotting and discharge.
40	344	I had zero spotting for the rest of that month and started my second period right on time.
40	345	but it's worn now, I've also been spotting too but the doctor said it should go in a couple of days.
40	346	My periods, which were previously light for 5 days, became heavy for 7-8 days, with spotting for 4 days beforehand.
40	347	I have only had Paragard for 1 month, and they say it gets better over time, so I am hoping that it really does get better, but those are the only symptoms I've had other than spotting during the month.
40	348	I am going on my 2nd week and the only thing that I have experienced is spotting and some gooey discharge every now and then (I don't know if this is normal, but I got to check into this).
40	349	Yes, my periods became heavier and lasted longer (from av 3 days to approx 7), but they were spot on time every month.
40	350	Did spot a week before my period on/off.
40	351	I practiced my yoga breathing and focused on a spot on the ceiling.
40	352	I spotted and cramped for about five days after the insertion.
40	353	Then I spotted till my next period on and off.
40	354	I spotted the next 3 days, I had to use pantie liners.
40	355	I spotted for several days afterward until my period started.
40	356	I spotted for the first month or so and that stopped after my cycle regulated.
40	357	The first month, I spotted regularly but when I got my period, it stopped.
40	358	I bled heavy for a week and spotted here and there during 2 month stretch.
40	359	I've gotten headaches everyday for the past year or so so having to take pills anyways doesn't bother me.
40	360	I had mood swings, headaches, SEVERE weight gain, no matter how much I worked out or exercised.
40	361	I got the Paragard in the spring of 2013 because I couldn't take hormonal birth control (terrible side effects of nausea, migraines, and mood swings).
40	362	I got it because I have chronic migraines worsened by hormones, but don't trust condoms alone.
40	363	I really like not using hormones because they killed my sex drive.
40	364	After getting the IUD, my sex drive went straight back up to where it used to be.
40	365	I was on mirena for 3 1/2 yrs, mirena was ok for me in the beginning, however I started realizing I gained a lot of weight I mean ALOT from 120 to 160lbs, I also had no sex drive at all I literally didn't want anything at all with my husband, to the point that it was more of a duty than a pleasant experience for me.
40	366	sex drive coming back so I'm happy :-)
40	367	I was worried about it affecting my sex drive.
40	368	Im looking forward to a normal sex drive, and I know I might get heavier periods but I prefer that to pumping my body with hormone.
40	369	My sex drive has increased.
40	370	Increased sex drive.
40	371	I really liked never having to remember to take a pill, or do anything, and I felt my libido was better on the copper IUD than on BCP.
40	372	I have had every type of contraception under the sun and none have agreed with me- weight gain, mood swings etc.
40	373	But I FEEL LIKE ME and there is no weight gain.
40	374	I got the IUD after really bad experiences with different birth control pills, had weight gain, UTI's, swelling, mood swings and sadness..
40	375	I have not had any weight gain or anything.
40	376	I was emotional and gained weight, I lasted a few weeks.
40	377	My period would last for 10_13 days and it was so heavy I had to stay home miss work the clots were so huge and very very painful I gained weight.
40	378	I was on the nuvaring for almost 2 years, and I gained 20 pounds, I was always very moody.
40	379	I have not gained weight.
40	380	But within a few days I began having panics attacks, nausea, loss of appetite, severe dizziness, sharp pains in my abdominal, head, and chest.
40	381	Neither is the nausea.
40	382	By the second month I started having unexplained nausea and dizziness, but thought nothing of it.
40	383	I couldn't drive home due to the nausea and vomited a couple of times during the car ride.
40	384	I threw up a bunch because I was so nauseated after it was done and it was awful.
40	385	On the way home I started feeling nauseated and light headed.
40	386	It felt like a knife was inside my cervix, and the pain made me nauseous, dizzy, shaky, and see stars.
40	387	Hormone based options have not worked without also making me very nauseous, so it's exciting to have a carefree long lasting option!
40	388	I did feel dizzy and immidiatly passout when i stood up.
40	389	A bit dizzy when I sat up, but immediately drove myself home just fine.
40	390	I was bleeding extremely heavily, getting dizzy and vomiting.
40	391	I also feel slightly dizzy, due to the small amount of epidural they had to inject into my cervix.
40	392	Cold sweats, shaking, crying, dizziness, the whole nine yards.
40	393	Nexplanon and the mini-pill gave me crazy mood swings and depression, so it had to be no hormones.
40	394	I have no mood swings.
40	395	Well,after trying several birth control methods, after experiencing a lot of mood changes and then got panic attacks and depression, I decided finally to put copper IUD in.
40	396	Horrible my mood changes are horrible I say different strokes different folks I would not get this again
40	397	I thought I'd share my experience as I read so many stories about the coil and the effects and it made me so nervous to go.
40	398	I was super nervous, I took 2 valium a little before the appointment and 1 while I was in the chair.
40	399	They were so wrenching that I was nervous I would keel over and people would get concerned.
40	400	I decided because of how nervous I was to go further than that.
40	401	I had a friend come with me to hold my hand as I was extremely nervous from reading horror stories on the Internet.
40	402	I'll say this much, I'm pretty nervous.
40	403	I was extremely nervous to get the IUD only because of the procedure to get it in.
40	404	I was a bit nervous with my decision since all the reviews on here mention this excruciating pain and I had not taken and pain reliever prior to my appointment.
40	405	Sex was a little painful at first - I don't know if it's just my being nervous about possible pain, but I felt little twinges of pain during.
40	406	I told the OBGYN how nervous I was and she said you've had a pap right, I said yes and she said you'll be fine.
40	407	I was schedule to go in on Tuesday September 1, 2015 so I went in with anticipation of pain and I was very nervous.
40	408	Now the part that I was most nervous about was the whole "me checking if I can feel the IUD strings" Its something I'm a bit uncomfortable doing mostly because I've never done it before so the first couple of times I tried to check for the strings I couldn't feel anything so I began to freak out and rushed to my doctors office after my unsuccessful attempts.
40	409	I have given a 5 to be netrual i gor my iud inserted today after reading reviews on herei took two cocodmol and two ibuprofen abiut 10 mins before going in, maybe not long enough to kick in i was pretty nervous the doctor asked the usual questions to update my file i then lay on the bed and she done a check.
40	410	When getting the paragaurd put in I was very nervous.
40	411	I am getting a bit anxious for my first period with it but since mine are a bit heavy to begin with I'm sure I'll be alright.
40	412	Hi all, I just wanted to share my experience with the copper IUD insertion procedure as I know many women (myself included) are very anxious and turned off by the procedure.
40	413	I mean sex was fine for me , didn't feel anything but I am a paranoid and anxious person.
40	414	I had a bit of depression and my anxiety was really bad.
40	415	Hormonal birth controls don't work very well for me since I have severe depression and anxiety.
40	416	I started experiencing increasing anxiety when I got this IUD, in the last week i've had a several panic attacks a day.
40	417	2 so severe, I ended up in the ER (at the hospital I work) i've developed health anxiety.
40	418	In the past I have had serious problems when it comes to hormones after being on the pill for 3 months I developed anxiety and panic attacks, this was unusual considering I'm a public speaker and have had no problems with standing in front of a crowd.
40	419	I immediately got a yeast infection; which I hadn't had one in about 10 years.
40	420	Really happy I️ chose this birth control especially because hormonal bc was giving me all kinds of issues, especially yeast infections.
40	421	After that, it seemed to cause yeast infections almost monthly.
40	422	I do get more yeast infections.
40	423	The worst part for me, however, was the fact that I got near-constant bacterial vaginitis and yeast infections throughout the entire time I had it in.
41	1	It worked great for clearing up my cystic acne and it did it’s job in preventing pregnancy; however, I’ve noticed the following for the past 2 years:
41	2	It cleared my skin completely (I am prone to acne) and made my periods lighter and PMS was so better easier with fewer mood swings that were not even half as bad as they were before I started taking Viorele.
41	3	I was on Lo Logestin Fe 24 for years and didn’t realize it was the reason I had acne, severe bloating and weight gain, and anger issues/depression/anxiety.
41	4	I immediately was less bloated, had less anxiety and depression, and my acne went away.
41	5	The few things I have experienced is trouble wearing contacts, darkening of facial skin, and a little more acne around chin.
41	6	Light periods, no cramps, no acne, no mood swings, no weight gain and did not mess with my Libido what so ever .
41	7	I didn't ever get pregnant on juleber or get acne or weight gain.
41	8	Ridiculous bloating, awful acne, breast pain; you name it.
41	9	I have combination skin and I am prone to acne.
41	10	I now only get a few breakouts a week or so before my period, but they are all cystic acne along my jaw line.
41	11	I have experienced the worst acne I've had in YEARS, my depression has gotten significantly worse, my blood pressure (which is usually spot on perfect) is frequently high, and my mood swings are horrible.
41	12	I have also noticed a decrease in acne which is always a plus.
41	13	It also helped clear up my cystic acne, and my weight has remained stable.
41	14	Now four months later I've been spotting non-stop for the past two weeks and my face is breaking out in acne that rests under the skin.
41	15	I mainly got on birth control to clear up my acne;  the breakouts weren't too bad, but definitely pesty.
41	16	First week increased acne like acne I've never had before in my life .
41	17	I didn't gain any weight, I don't feel any moodier, my acne has cleared up, my periods are lighter.
41	18	My acne has been clearing up as well.
41	19	I've tried other bc pills and right away they either made me depressed, nauseated, made my period last for weeks, gain weight, breasts ballooned up and were painful, cramps every day, acne, pretty much every awful side effect you can think of.
41	20	Overall this was great for acne and cramping but the depression and weight gain was not worth it.
41	21	In fact this pill seemed to clear up my hormonal acne pretty well!
41	22	This is by far the BEST bcp for my cystic, hormonal acne.
41	23	If you suffer from hormonal acne, definitely give Caziant a try.
41	24	Almost entirely cleared up my acne outside of a touch right before I get my period.
41	25	I had no weight gain no acne no babies and no cysts.
41	26	After one month, my acne cleared up, my period got much shorter, and my cramps were less intense.
41	27	I tried Mircette for a week, in an effort to manage my PCOS symptoms (low progesterone, acne, irritability, no menstruated cycles), and this pill was terrible.
41	28	No weight changes, however I noticed it did nothing to help my acne, which was a factor in starting birth control.
41	29	This pill cleared up my acne, as well.
41	30	It lightened my period and got rid of my cramps and acne!
41	31	I used to get hormonal acne the week before my period on my chin, and once I took the pills I stopped breaking out.
41	32	I started the pill 3 weeks ago I'm about to begin the 4th week tomorrow, I've experienced breast tenderness since the first pill I've taken and it's been inconsistent and hasn't stopped yet, normally I'd just have breast soreness the week of my period then it would stop but when I took the pill it hasn't stopped, i did get acne the first week but it cleared up, I have noticed some mood swing change as i got closer to the 2 green pills, but I normally pms the week before my period, it seems as tho my patience is a lot thinner now though then it was before, I'm nervous for the yellow pills because my periods weren't ever bad before and I'm afraid there gonna be longer or something but i hope not.
41	33	My acne did somewhat get better, I would definitely recommend this to underweight people it added a few pounds on me!
41	34	It got rid of my acne, and constant hot flashes.
41	35	I started the pack on the first day after my period, it has completely cleared up any acne, my boobs have gone up a size and I feel I've lost some weight due to a lack of appetite.
41	36	My acne has gone away, I do not have any weight gain, decreasing weight actually.
41	37	It hasn't helped with acne at all, it actually started to cause body acne which I've never had.
41	38	It cleared my acne, and gave me a predictable period.
41	39	The fact that it cleared my acne was the most amazing thing for me.
41	40	It was great for controlling acne and I only gained 3 pounds being on it.
41	41	My doctor started me on Karvia after having a terrible experience with Chateal which gave me terrible acne.
41	42	I also never gained any weight or experienced acne.
41	43	Have trialed twice & both times have had weight gain (10-15lbs), increased acne (I don't normally break out), and uncontrollable emotions.
41	44	Cystic acne in places I never had it before.
41	45	During the first 3 months I had terrible mood swings and acne.
41	46	Was on this for about a year, completely cleared up my premenstrual acne.
41	47	Other than that, I'd recommend it if you have a tendency to get premenstrual acne.
41	48	I switched from Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo because it was no longer combatting my acne and my sex drive had started dropping.
41	49	It didn't seem to help my acne either.
41	50	I get dizzy, have severe headaches, cystic acne, extreme cramps, and the worst part of it all is my moods are awful.
41	51	My moods and acne have now practically vanished once I stopped taking it.
41	52	The pros of this pill are: kept my acne away and it kept my mood stable no crying or moodiness.
41	53	When my doctor suggested the pill for acne I said sure why not.
41	54	My acne has been a lot better and my periods are more normal although they do last a bit longer, my mood has also been consistent.
41	55	I mainly went on it to control my periods and clear up my acne which I was fed up with after years.
41	56	Before taking Viorele my face was completely clear but since I've been taking it, my face is COVERED in painful acne  Other than the acne, the pill is great.
41	57	I'm using acne toner, spot treatment, oil-free moisturizer, and a foundation for acne-prone skin and none of it has made any difference.
41	58	It's made my acne much worse, but.
41	59	Worked wonders for me, acne diminished into oblivion, no weight gain (of which I was terrified), no change in libido to my knowledge, increase in breast size (to my utter delight), no mood swings, and I'm not pregnant.
41	60	In fact, it has cleared my acne up some.
41	61	I had mild to moderate acne before taking the pill and it has helped it clear up a lot!
41	62	Since I started taking Desogen its cleared up my acne.
41	63	My acne cleared up (I'm 27 and have always battled with acne) for the most part.
41	64	Positives: predictable 5 day periods, no acne, less moodswings.
41	65	The pill seemed to clear up any acne, the only breakouts I have now are around my period (to be expected).
41	66	It's reduced my acne, which is a plus and if it's had any effect on my mood, it's positive.
41	67	I went on Kariva because I was told that it helped with acne along with being an effective birth control method.
41	68	No sex drive, extreme mood swings, acne and increased appetite.
41	69	It also didn't help my acne and I get super irritable right before my off week.
41	70	Helped with my cramping and had no spotting but gave me large cystic acne.
41	71	It took me several months before I realized desogen was the cause of the acne but once I stopped taking it, it went away.
41	72	I don't know about the acne part, I haven't noticed a bad or good change, it's pretty much the same.
41	73	I decided to take the pill to help with my mood and my acne.
41	74	My acne has become more horrible than I have ever experienced in my life.
41	75	I have acne all over my back and chest now, a place where I had never had acne before.
41	76	However, the good side effect is that my boobs seems bigger and my acne cleared up completely.
41	77	Any time I went off of Caziant to "switch it up" was when I started breaking out horribly in cystic bumps.
41	78	My skin was as clear as could be while on yaz and within 2 weeks of taking Kariva I started breaking out more than usual.
41	79	Didn't gain any weight and never got any pimples.
41	80	This pill has given me pimples, my boobs have grown a cup size, but hurt all the time I can't even jog.
41	81	Normally I would only get a couple pimples before each period but this medication didn't cause any, great clear skin.
41	82	I have been on Kariva for 12 months and my skin is porcelain-like, no pimples, lost a few pounds (I've been going to the gym, so it might not even be the birth control), and my mood stayed consistent.
41	83	I went from layering on concealer to cover red, even purple zits on my face to being confident in my skin.
41	84	It does a pretty good job at clearing up my skin but occasionally I get large single zits once in a while.
41	85	Period is light but cramps can be horrible sometimes.
41	86	It did not help my cramps what so ever and it made me very emotional.
41	87	I can say once I got off all birth control it was the first time I ever had cramps, felt sluggish and had mood swings.
41	88	Her periods last forever, she's always exhausted, looks like a zombie half the time, got sick with a cough and took a month to kick it, has NO energy, NO strength, gaining weight, Horrible headaches and period cramps.
41	89	My periods last an entire week and I get debilitating cramps, so bad to where they make me sick the first few days.
41	90	Good side, not pregnant, mood is better, less menstrual cramps then on other pills.
41	91	It got rid of my cramps, it regulated my period, and it worked in respects to preventing pregnancy, but for the past 6 months, I experienced a severe decrease in my libido, almost it was nonexistent.
41	92	I got my period at the very end of the week each time with bad cramps.
41	93	My only complaint is that the cramps are quite bad, but it's done its job for me, so I can't complain!
41	94	I had intense cramps to the point that I couldn't move and had to practice breathing exercises.
41	95	But after that week, the migraines were gone and I literally had no cramps, headache, nausea, or any menstrual signs.
41	96	I was really impressed at first because my face was very clear and my horrible cramps and back aches from my period went away.
41	97	It made my cramps worse, I constantly got spotting days before my scheduled period.
41	98	Horrible cramps that would me bed ridden are mostly gone.
41	99	Just have moderate cramps for 24 hours after first getting my period.
41	100	Used to have cramps that were so bad I fainted or threw up and it was miserable.
41	101	Was on Tri-Previfem before this and it was mild and didn't help with cramps that much.
41	102	I originally went on the pill for my severe cramps and heavy bleeding.
41	103	I originally went on birth control because I get really bad cramps before I get my period, during, and after.
41	104	I have had every terrible side effect from stomach cramps, severe depression, insane mood swings, nausea, feeling lethargic, I mean...just the worst I've ever felt.
41	105	It increased my irritability, and gave me the worst cramps I've ever had.
41	106	I've been taking Azurette 28's since August 7th 2016 and have been experiencing cramps since the 2nd or 3rd day.
41	107	No crazy mood swings and less cramps!
41	108	No emotional problems, period lasts anywhere from 3-7 days, cramps aren't as bad, good sex drive!
41	109	I don't have cramps anymore.
41	110	I keep binge eating, have cramps, my vagina is almost tingling a lot, my face gets very flush and red and my skin is super dry.
41	111	The only problems I have with Azurette, is that I now have extreme cramps, and I also have issues with my sex drive.
41	112	I usually experience cramps and bloating the day before and the day I get my period.
41	113	My cramps have always been pretty bad even before I began using birth control, so I don't think it is caused by the pill.
41	114	I typically have a light flow with little cramps, but the flow has increased to the point where I have to change a tampon and pad almost every hour!
41	115	I had no cramps, my periods were regulate, my skin was clear.
41	116	The only downside is that I find my cramps are 10x worse, and I have gained some weight, I've especially seen that my breasts have grown.
41	117	I had normal period flows before getting on birth control (7 days), but severe cramps.
41	118	Azurette completely relieved me of cramps and my periods were lighter (3-4 days).
41	119	My cramps are worse than they were when I was not on birth control.
41	120	My cramps are manageable and kind of bad sometimes but I try not to take pain killers.
41	121	Before I was sexually active I had little to no cramps, but I guess sex changes your hormones and stuff.
41	122	I gave it a 9/10 and not a 10/10 because I now get cramps and a little moody, but it's worked really well for me.
41	123	I did have worse cramps then I did when I wasn't on the pill but they tended to last only about 2 days.
41	124	My period was very light and best of all no cramps.
41	125	I would say my cramps may be a little worse, but since the period is shorter it evens out.
41	126	I originally got on the pill to help reduce my cramps because they were so painful.
41	127	The pain of my cramps did lessen, but occasionally it was still as intense as it was before I was on the pill.
41	128	My period has been heavier and I am getting cramps again.
41	129	My skin has cleared up, I have less cramps and far less moodiness before my period.
41	130	It didn't help at all with my terrible cramps.
41	131	I used to have horrible periods (horrible cramps, puking, the whole nine yards) but now there's only light cramping on the first day.
41	132	The good things about Velivet: Perfect for contraception, great for regulating your period, increased my breast size by half a cup, no real cramps, no weight gain.
41	133	Usually I get pretty bad cramps, especially on the second day of my period.
41	134	However, I've noticed that for the past couple months I only got mild cramps on the first day, and none on the second.
41	135	No weight gain, but sometimes moody and have cramps but that's normal.
41	136	Both sets of periods I get come with cramps, bloating (and several pounds of weight gain, which disappears once my period is over), and moodiness.
41	137	But I'd rather get my period every month than cramp all the time.. my skin did look amazing on this and no weight gain either.
41	138	Kariva solved my cramp problem and I did not experience any nausea OR depression/mood swings like I had on other pills.
41	139	No pregnancies, light menstruation and no cramping.
41	140	I've been taking it for a year and have decided to switch to something else because of the cramping I got even when not on my period.
41	141	Also, my period cramping, bloating, and pain has significantly decreased with the help of this pill.
41	142	Another 6 months later I started bleeding through super tampons in less than an hour and had cramping so bad I could not even move.
41	143	Lost 10 lbs in 6 days, depression was gone, and no more heavy cramping and bleeding.
41	144	On the plus, my skin never looked better and while the periods were long, I had  minimal cramping.
41	145	I've noticed that my cramping has came back and it has taken my sex drive away completely!
41	146	I had severe cramping, swollen & painful breasts, and bloating like crazy.
41	147	My skin is good, periods are light, cramping is limited and mood is normal.
41	148	I've also experienced some pretty painful menstrual cramping.
41	149	My period is only 3 days long though, and no nausea or cramping to go with.
41	150	I had headaches, felt fatigued, experienced a heavier period with more cramping, and gained weight.
41	151	(Back pain, leg pain, cramping, clots, diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, etc) I couldn't attend work or school because it made me so sick.
41	152	I've been on this for about 3 years and experience very little cramping and other period side effects which is great.
41	153	On the bright side, my periods have been light and short (still painful cramping) and my skin has never looked better.
41	154	Horrible starting with the very first pill: severe cramping, migraine, lose bowels, tiredness, confusion, nausea.
41	155	I didn't gain weight on this pill and it did lighten my periods and cramping which used to be unbearable.
41	156	My periods were short and light, no weight gain or bloating, no cramping or mood swings, however the no sex drive didn't work for me.
41	157	At first it was great, it took care of my cramping that I had week before my period.
41	158	Also, much less cramping and feelings of nausea during my period.
41	159	At half-way through my third pack, I have been bleeding heavily for a week (compared to the first day of a regular period, but ongoing and with cramping).
41	160	Nonstop spotting for 6 weeks.
41	161	First month was a bit moody and had spotting but after that my very irregular period (weeks off) became regular almost to the hour.
41	162	Definitely does it's job birth-control wise, there was some prolonged spotting after my first period on the pill but my flow was steady after that.
41	163	I have had no spotting or anything, as long as you take your pill correctly your experience with kariva will be great!
41	164	Desogen stopped all the spotting but it killed my sex drive.
41	165	My periods were light, lasted about 5 days, predictable, and no spotting.
41	166	I haven't had mood swings, my periods have been incredibly regular with no spotting in between, no headaches or nausea so all-in-all I would say this is a good birth control!
41	167	This pill is one of the few I don't have spotting or crazy 3 week periods with.
41	168	If I took the pill an hour or two later than normal I would spot and I was spotting all month long because of this.
41	169	Giving it another try I started the pill once again but instead this time after my period ended solving the spotting issue, but I notice that after the first month of taking the pill I fall into depression once again.
41	170	However, when I first started taking it I noticed a prolonged time of spotting but it did eventually go away and I am pleased overall with this pill!
41	171	I have been experiencing headaches and before using Orthocept I rarely got headaches, I've also experienced dark spotting for two weeks leading up to my period.
41	172	I did that for 3 packs and now I have had spotting off and on for 2 months and my face has broken out and I got another migraine.
41	173	Haven't had my period for four years, no breakthrough bleeding, no spotting, no worries.
41	174	There were no mood problems or spotting.
41	175	I had noticed that if I miss more than one pill in a given week I will have some spotting.
41	176	I haven't noticed any loss of sex drive, mood swings and the only spotting I had was from missing two days.
41	177	I had some itching, mood swings, spotting and lowered sex drive in the first two months.
41	178	Also, I started the pill with the first day method (on the first day of my period) causing me to spot for the whole 2 months of taking the pill.
41	179	This is on top of having spotted nearly continuously since I started these pills two and a half months ago.
41	180	I suffered through menstrual migraines and headaches for years, for 3 weeks out of the month I had a headache almost every single day.
41	181	No headache.
41	182	Worst birth control ever, make me sick, I have headaches since the day 1, mood swings, anxious , was feeling terrible, so I found out that a lot of people taking this birth control are having the same conditions, so I stoped, the next day my headache was gone.
41	183	I had a bad migraine headache over the weekend, i felt so terrible I was throwing up and I couldn't lay down because my entire skull felt like it was shattering into a million little pieces.
41	184	Suffered with fatigue, nausea, headache, severe depression, and many pms symptoms.
41	185	Then all of a sudden, I started getting unbelievably painful pounding headaches.
41	186	After about 10 more days of horrible debilitating headaches, they finally stopped.
41	187	It gave me frequent headaches that I didn't experience on the azurette even though they are supposed to be the same.
41	188	I did have headaches, nausea, breast tenderness and mood swings in the beginning.
41	189	I haven't had headaches.
41	190	I also didn't like was how many headaches I would get; at least 3-4 a week.
41	191	I started this pill in October 2015 and have had THREE headaches.
41	192	I gained over 30 lbs, had terrible nausea, mood swings, anxiety, depression, headaches, almost NO libido, you name it.
41	193	Been taking this medication for the past 2 weeks and I've expierenced nausea , dizziness, headaches and feeling depressed I'm currently seeking to change my b/c
41	194	I do notice that I get more headaches.
41	195	I also get constant headaches on this pill.
41	196	I get severe headaches for a week, very lightheaded and dizzy.I havnt been able to get out of bed for the past 2 day's, my body feels very weak, I can't get my excercise in, I feel very down.
41	197	I changed to this birth control at the advice of my gyn to try to treat my menstrual migraine headaches after being on tri-sprintec for almost 10 years.
41	198	I gained over 20 pounds in less than 6 months, had really really bad mood swings, and the medicine caused me to have bad headaches and migraines at least once a week.
41	199	Estrogen placebos did nothing to help menstrual migraine/estrogen withdrawls dibiltating headaches.
41	200	On brand I didn't have the daily headaches.
41	201	Took kariva & had the most dibiltating migraine/daily headaches ever.
41	202	No out of normal weight gain, no headaches or mood swings.
41	203	The first couple of months, I experienced mood swings, headaches and weird appetite.
41	204	I'd experience dizziness to the point where I'd have to sit down and also had an increase in constant headaches.
41	205	I've never been one to have any type of headaches of any kind, and after being on Kariva I experience headaches multiple times a day.
41	206	For weeks I had horrible headaches to the point where I couldn't think, and then had terrible mood swings.
41	207	I would become very numb also and my headaches seem to have turned into migraines!
41	208	I tried this for several months and loved everything about it except the migraine headaches that I would experience about 2-3 times a month and nothing would help them go away.
41	209	I didn't gain weight, I didn't have mood swings and everything was fine except the headaches.
41	210	This birth control has given me the worst anxiety, migraines, heart palpitations, and I'm dizzy constantly.
41	211	I haven't had any migraines, mood swings, or breakouts since starting the pill.
41	212	I have taken this less then a month and it's affected me majorly I have migraines constantly, my breast are super sensitive and my boyfriend has probably almost broken up with me 3 times now due to massive mood swings.
41	213	The first month I started I had a week of migraines and a strenuous and painful menstrual period .
41	214	I get bad migraines now when I'm on my period and feel really sluggish.
41	215	Literally on day 3 I started getting powerful migraines, I couldn't sleep from them, my eyes would tear up, I started taking at least 4 Advil on the daily for them to be BEARABLE.
41	216	It gave me migraines every 3 days, it was so bad.
41	217	It has increased my migraines greatly and also has lowered my sex drive.
41	218	The only bad thing was awful debilitating migraines I dealt with for years that only stopped once I got off this pill.
41	219	Then I started to get really bad migraines.
41	220	The migraines are just too much.
41	221	Also very bad migraines.
41	222	However, I experienced severe migraines that were bad enough.
41	223	I've been getting menstrual migraines from withdrawal sometimes during my period.
41	224	But I have had terrible migraines with blurred vision and it has not lightened or shortened my period, which is why I was prescribed this.
41	225	My sex drive is not as high.
41	226	Severe mood swings, depression, anxiety, constant gastrointestinal issues, zero sex drive, and the list goes on.
41	227	Depression, constant aches and pains, bloating, decrease in sex drive, and yeast infections are most of my symptoms.
41	228	I also have had NO sex drive.
41	229	I lost all of my sex drive and became very dry down there.
41	230	My sex drive has been great.
41	231	I have absolutely no sex drive on this medication, I am constantly always dry now, and my emotions are out of control.
41	232	My sex drive has also decreased as well as my eating habits.
41	233	I have no sex drive also.
41	234	Only complaint (which isn't really one, it's subjective) is that my sex drive is a lot more.
41	235	My sex drive was pretty high before, and is now the same, or even more now that I don't have to worry about getting pregnant.
41	236	I have not had abnormal mood swings or a change in sex drive.
41	237	Other benefits are light & short periods, very mild mood swings, normal sex drive, no weight gain.
41	238	Doesn't seem to have a strong effect on my sex drive either way.
41	239	I didn't lose my sex drive.
41	240	In addition, I have absolutely no sex drive and a lot of dryness.
41	241	What I don't like is my vagina is so dry when normally it's wet all the time, and my sex drive has diminished quite a bit.
41	242	The second month taking it however I would feel nauseous, but it went away, and it also weirdly increased my sex drive.
41	243	My sex drive is the same and my breast have gone from a C to a DD while being on this pill.
41	244	Since I have been on it less than a month, my breasts are painfully tender as well as HUGE, I'm extremely moody and bitchy, weight gain/bloated not sure which, nausea, 0 sex drive, the only good side is I'm extremely project oriented on task.
41	245	Kariva gets rid of my period about 99% of the time, and with that, it decreases sex drive.
41	246	It definitely does the job, no babies and lighter periods, the first month was hard, depressed and low sex drive but those symptoms have gone now.
41	247	I have been on Kariva for less than 2 years, and I guess I never read the drug information because my sex drive is near nothing.
41	248	It cleared my face up, and I did not experience tremendous weight gain but I lost my sex drive and became extremely moody and depressed.
41	249	My sex drive is super high, but sex is extremely painful if i'm taking my pill.
41	250	Other than that my sex drive, weight, moods and eating habits have all stayed the same.
41	251	Also my sex drive was nonexistent.
41	252	My sex drive hasn't changed, but I am extremely dry and experienced discomfort during sex.
41	253	My sex drive also decreased significantly.
41	254	But I experience drastic mood swings, no sex drive whatsoever, and my hooha is like a desert.
41	255	No change in sex drive but it did cause some serious dryness for me in that I just wouldn't get wet down there which was frustrating for me and my bf!
41	256	Sex drive is still as usual.
41	257	My sex drive has not been negatively affected by taking this medication.
41	258	I was bloated all the time, would fly off the handle, insanely irritable, having weird cravings, super anti-social, absolutely zero sex drive, and would have dramatic crying episodes over little things.
41	259	Another down fall was it completely shutdown my sex drive which is fine if you are single and looking to stay out of trouble.
41	260	No issues with mood changes, or loss of sex drive.
41	261	Sex drive over time has decreased - but I'm also a lot more stressed since starting my career (I'm 26).
41	262	I have significantly gained weight in a short period of time (about 10lbs) and my sex drive is slim to none.
41	263	I completely lost my sex drive.
41	264	Now I have realized that over the past year, it has made me completely emotionless and I have absolutely zero sex drive.
41	265	Only pro is it made my bleeding become normal again, also had zero sex drive and my breasts did not grow like all other pills have made them.
41	266	Didn't affect my sex drive though.
41	267	I'm switching to either the patch or the ring this month though because my sex drive has been awful for the past 4-5 months, and it's driving me (and my boyfriend) crazy!
41	268	Sleep disruptions, loss of appetite, and lower sex drive have also been symptoms I've experienced.
41	269	I also have a pretty low sex drive.
41	270	My doctor suggested Kariva to me because I was previously on Ortho Tri-Cyclen (which made me extremely moody/emotional) and more recently Lo-Estrin (which gave me no sex drive whatsoever and made me completely emotionless).
41	271	Everything about it was great except for one thing, NO SEX DRIVE whatsoever.
41	272	The bad news is I was very moody, no sex drive, and had a vaginal itch.
41	273	However, I'm not pregnant, but I don't know if that had to do with it killing my sex drive.
41	274	ZERO sex drive.
41	275	They checked me for a tumor, decreased sex drive, tired, nervous, dizziness, weight change, appetite change, and numbness on the left arm and hand.
41	276	Two down sides: total libido killer (I feel like a robot sometimes), and a bit of weight gain.
41	277	I definitely notice a decreased libido, as well as mood swings, but nothing that can't be handled.
41	278	I have been on this pill for about a year with no major side effects except for a decrease in libido.
41	279	All of the emotional issues and the low libido really took a toll on my relationship.
41	280	Switched from Ortho-Cyclen (Sprintec) bc of decrease in libido.
41	281	For me it does the opposite I have a regular libido sometimes a bit high lol.
41	282	I have always used the pill and so far this birth control has not affected my mood, appetite or libido negatively.
41	283	Very effective birth control as it almost eliminated my libido!
41	284	I have not experienced any weight gain, moodiness, or low libido.
41	285	Negatives: weight gain (20 pounds), NO libido whatsoever.
41	286	I've stopped taking it, immediately lost 5 pounds, have a great libido again, and find it easy to track my period with P-Tracker app.
41	287	My libido has also increased and I'm not pregnant so it's working ok.
41	288	After being off of it for a month or so, my libido returned.
41	289	I recently switched OFF of Kariva after missing a week of pills - I didn't even realize until then how low my libido had been!
41	290	Also have low libido which I'm not sure if it's related to this pill.
41	291	Weight gain, bloated.
41	292	I haven’t had any weight gain or mood swings.
41	293	No weight gain except for some water weight.
41	294	The weight gain actually didn't happen for the first year, so I'm not totally certain that the pill was the cause.
41	295	It's been proven that birth control isn't the cause of weight gain.
41	296	The only weight gain I have noticed is that my breasts grew a whole cup size.
41	297	My anxiety was exacerbated, depression came back, was extremely emotional, constantly hungry (gained weight because of that), went up 2 cup sizes due to swelling & weight gain, and was bloated all the time.
41	298	I gained weight while on it but I started it pretty young and I know weight gain is pretty common around that time.
41	299	I had no bad side effects no weight gain nothing.
41	300	I didn't experience any mood swings or weight gain.
41	301	I didn't experience any weight gain.
41	302	No real weight gain but just a general nausea, pelvic, and back pain most of the time.
41	303	It did make my breasts fuller but the weight gain is terrible.
41	304	I did not experience any bad moods, fatigue, or weight gain as with other pills so Azurette is the most tolerable pill by far for me.
41	305	All medicines have side effects that being said; the down side was slight increase of my blood pressure & slight weight gain.
41	306	Pros include no weight gain, minimal mood swings, minimal bloating and shorter periods.
41	307	This weight gain could however be from the stress of college and a new boyfriend.
41	308	It did not cause me any weight gain.
41	309	I have also noticed mild weight gain as well.
41	310	I gained like 7 lbs.
41	311	I haven't lost or gained weight.
41	312	I gained 20 pounds in the first 2 months and could not lose it.
41	313	I haven't gained any bloatingness, or gained weight, but that could be because I exercise, and have a minimal decreased appetite since I've been on the pill.
41	314	But, my boobs have gotten bigger and I do notice that I have gained some weight in my upper thighs and hips.
41	315	After a few months I gained 20 pounds and 2 cup sizes and became very depressed and anxious.
41	316	The last bad side effect ....I've gained weight.
41	317	However, I have gained 20 pounds and a full cup size since being on the pill.
41	318	I've even noticed that I have gained weight.
41	319	I have gained excess weight, which never happened to me on any other b.c., and my PMDD is worse.
41	320	I gained  6 lbs in that time and hadn't changed my eating patterns.
41	321	I am sensative to contraceptives and on the shot, I gained 30 pounds quickly.
41	322	After being on azurette for 6 months I started getting severe bloating, depression, anxiety, tiredness and gained 15 lbs in 10 months even though I was eating healthy and working out.
41	323	But I gained about 10 pounds on it which was awful!
41	324	I've gained about 15 pounds since starting the meds and have been exercising a ton and eating very healthy the entire time, so I'm fairly certain it has to do with the medication.
41	325	Have always had decent sized breasts but with Ortho-Cept I gained probably about 15 pounds and became a triple D.  Also was nauseous all the time.
41	326	I was on Kariva for about 6 months and gained about 15 pounds.
41	327	I was all squishy and plump and considering I gained all of my weight on my stomach, wearing anything other than sweatpants felt horrible.
41	328	The first month I felt nauseous, tender breast, I gained 10 lbs and I turned very moody (especially with my boyfriend).
41	329	I have not gained weight from this pill.
41	330	By February of 2012, I was nauseous and puking after meals--went to the doctor and discovered that I had also gained 16 pounds!
41	331	I'm extremely tired all the time and I've gained weight in my breasts (I'm naturally a D and I've went up to a large DD).
41	332	Only negative is I have gained about 15 pounds since starting Kariva (much of which went straight to my breasts).
41	333	I gained 15 pounds on the drug in less than a month.
41	334	Perhaps, I was working out too much (about 3-5 per week) that I gained more muscle on my thighs.
41	335	I haven't gained any weight- if at all, I've lost a few pounds.
41	336	I was prescribed this for birth control because I didn't like the weight I gained on Yaz, but it was a mistake.
41	337	I'm even beginning to lose the weight I gained from being on the depo shot (not much, only 15 pounds after 6 years of it)!
41	338	I went on Cyred and my skin has been awful from the beginning (like so bad), my boobs are still very sore, and I experience nausea constantly.
41	339	I am having pregancy like nausea.
41	340	Headache nausea vomiting lightheadiness in 2nd week .
41	341	I was getting hot flashes, burning up at night, fatigue, nausea and easily agitated/emotional.
41	342	My first week on the pill, I experienced heavy nausea & diarrhea, so first timers keep that in mind.
41	343	I do have times when I'm just in a mood due to the extra hormones but I have not experienced any nausea or pain with this medication.
41	344	I take it at night, and I dont have any nausea or anything like I did with other BC methods.
41	345	However there were side effects of this drug, as expected (rash, nausea, loss of appetite, vaginal infection)  but they are manageable.
41	346	Terrible nausea and gastrointestinal issues were only compounded by decreased appetite and a general grumpiness toward the world.
41	347	I have taken it only a month and have experienced bloating, nausea, breast tenderness, fluctuation in appetite, constipation, and I get mad at my boyfriend very easily.
41	348	I knew that nausea would be common, but I didn't realize that I would not be able to sleep.
41	349	My abdomen is bloated, I am gassy to the point of severe pain, and I have had bouts of diarrhea and nausea.
41	350	And other pills made me moody or nauseated.
41	351	I started on birth control after I would get nauseous for two weeks out of every the month.
41	352	I also got nauseous after taking the first pack.
41	353	The first week and half, I'm unbearable nauseous and hardly have an appetite.
41	354	After 3 days of starting this new birth control, I was feeling nauseous.
41	355	Kept me from getting pregnant and was easy to remember to take because of packaging, but it made me nauseous in the morning for the first couple of months.
41	356	I constantly felt nauseous for the first month, and then felt really bloated.
41	357	I was nauseous constantly!
41	358	This pill made me nauseous the first 2 months I took it.
41	359	I didn't have any nauseous symptoms with this pill even taking it in the morning on an empty stomach.
41	360	(Although I haven't had another ultrasound) but I have been nauseous every single damn day.
41	361	Also, the first month I took the pill I would get incredibly nauseous everyday around 8 or 9 pm, but thankfully that subsided.
41	362	The most scary part is yet to come...  A month and a half into it I became EXTREMELY dizzy and light headed.
41	363	However 2 weeks off of it and I am still extremely dizzy and lightheaded.
41	364	Horrible bloating, sick to my stomach, vomiting, dizzy.
41	365	I was sick to my stomach, bloated non stop and felt dizzy.
41	366	So far I have had only bloating and some dizziness.
41	367	The only side effects are tender breasts, changes in weight but not bad only when I get lazy and occasional dizziness.
41	368	It has now been 4 months off of Kariva and I have not had one mood swing or case of anxiety.
41	369	No period, thyroiditis, mood swings, depression...yuck!
41	370	Since I've been put on Viorele, I've had the WORST mood swings, and bad depression.
41	371	I had been taking the other birth control for so long, I thought it was just me that had crazy mood swings every month.
41	372	Also increased my mood swings .
41	373	I've been on Kariva for a months now after switching from loestrin (which gave me insane mood swings and heavy discharge).
41	374	Maybe for the first week I experienced mood swings at the same time at night when I took the pill but it didn't last if that was related to it.
41	375	Would never take these tablets again, I'm having awful abdominal pain, it's made my mood swings horrendous the only good thing is that it's made my period less heavy, however it's now lasting longer than it ever has before.
41	376	I'm having mood swings as well.
41	377	The worst part about the experience in general was the mood swings.
41	378	It also helped extremely for my mood swings that I used to get before my period.
41	379	It made me have regular light periods and toned down my mood swings.
41	380	It seemed to keep my mood swings down.
41	381	I have been super irritable & have unpredictable mood swings.
41	382	I had to switch to Kariva because yaz caused mood swings.
41	383	I experienced the most horrendous mood swings and extreme anxiety while on this drug.
41	384	I get mood swings too.
41	385	No more horrible mood swings, and all of the symptoms associated with the pill.
41	386	Been on Kariva for 2 months and it has its good and bads.. BAD: I have never experienced such bad mood swings in my life.
41	387	So be aware of the horrible mood swings.
41	388	I have constant mood swings and cry easily.
41	389	The one thing I don't like about it is the mood swings.
41	390	I have also noticed that me and my boyfriend have been fighting a lot because of the mood swings.
41	391	I'm constantly depressed, and get bad mood swings.
41	392	The only downside was around my period I would have crazy intensified mood swings, angry one second and crying the next.
41	393	I finally happened upon this miracle that evened out my mood swings, gave me a shorter lighter period and gave me clearer skin than I've had in 10 years.
41	394	I have had crazy mood swings.
41	395	My mood swings were horrible.
41	396	I’m pretty nervous about that.
41	397	After reading a lot of negative reviews I was nervous at first to start Kariva.
41	398	Velivet worked well as birth control, but made me really nervous and emotional all the time.
41	399	I have be incredibly irritable, anxious, and depressed.
41	400	I have always been an anxious person by nature but Kariva increased my level of self-conciousness, stress, & feeling of uneasiness.
41	401	I was anxious to find a happy medium after going from one extreme to the other.
41	402	I am trying Yaz now, and it’s creating severe anxiety, so I may come back to Viorele.
41	403	I was agitated and my anxiety and depression were worse.
41	404	I was very emotional and depressed with severe anxiety.
41	405	6 months in  I started to suffer from anxiety and depression.
41	406	I just switched bands so I'm hoping these symptoms stop, especially the paranoia and anxiety.
41	407	Though I have experienced anxiety before taking the pill, it has gotten much worse since being on it.
41	408	I had the worst mood-swings and anxiety from Ortho-tri-cyclen.
41	409	I experienced the worst anxiety and depression of my life.
41	410	Would not recommend if you have anxiety or pmdd as it only seems to exacerbate these conditions.
41	411	I started getting anxiety attacks and debilitating depression.
41	412	If you are someone with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder or similar, I would suggest strongly against taking this oral contraceptive.
41	413	However I wanted to switch to a new pill because I felt breast tenderness more often and I wanted the ability to be able to skip my period (my old pill had different dosages each week which made this difficult).
41	414	I don't have any breast tenderness like I used to and I have gone up a cup size.
41	415	I've been on Ortho-Cept for a month, and I have not had any side effects other than occasional breast tenderness.
41	416	The only side effect I've had is breast tenderness but my body is extremely sensitive to the hormones.
41	417	Haven't noticed any negative side effects aside from mild breast tenderness on the third week of my cycle.
41	418	I've experienced sore breasts, they have increased in size, severe dry eye, fatigue, depression, increased craving appetite of sugars and carbs than before like I feel pregnant, I have no drive or desire to exercise or do anything.
41	419	My breasts hurt and I always feel sick.
41	420	In fact, I just came off of Kariva a few weeks ago due to a severe yeast infection which I had no idea what was causing, and since then my hormones are insane from being off of it.
41	421	Had several yeast infections and always felt kind of itchy.
42	1	I originally went on Beyaz when I started college (6 years ago) for hormonal acne and this helped.
42	2	No bad mood swings and it already helping my acne (the reason I went on it).
42	3	I have been on beyaz for about 4 years and had been very happy with it--it controlled my mild acne which is one of the main reasons for taking this birth control.
42	4	Another bonus: I used to get painful cystic acne on my chin whenever it was my time of the month, and since beginning this pill I haven't had to deal with any acne whatsoever!
42	5	I love this, really it regulates me, helps my acne for sure, and it makes being a woman a lot less painful.
42	6	I had bad acne before I started it and I get compliments all the time now about how clear and smooth my face is!
42	7	And I would recommend this pill to someone who knows they can take it on time everyday, who wants to get rid of their acne, and who doesn't want any kids!
42	8	No babies, no bad acne, super light periods here and there..
42	9	It's cool for keeping weight down, acne, and no babies.
42	10	Unfortunately my acne went full force, 6 months into the new pill my entire face was broken out.
42	11	There was also a mild increase in acne toward the end of the first pack but it went away and my skin became very clear.
42	12	I have never had acne, so I can't really speak on that, but I will say that I have had quite a few breakouts while being on Beyaz.
42	13	Other than depression, other negative effects have been weight gain (nearly 10lbs), low sex drive, and my acne has stayed prominent.
42	14	I've never really had any acne, however I used to get random pimples on my thighs which was so strange to me but when I started Beyaz they quickly disappeared.
42	15	My acne has gotten much worse, but they say this happens at first and then clear skin follows.
42	16	I started Safyral in April for irregular menstrual cycle and severe pms my only complaint was that for about a week or two I was spotting off and on but my periods are very light I'm use to very heavy flow no backaches cramps I still will get an occasional pimple literally 1 or 2 a few days before my cycle but no acne mood swings or depression my only regret is not starting this sooner
42	17	I just finished a package of Safyral yesterday, and so far I've had no weight gain, my acne has cleared up some, and my period came when it was supposed to.
42	18	It really helped with moderate acne, sometimes I would break out on my back and chest since taking I don't remember when I had a blemish.
42	19	No weight gain, acne cleared up, shorter/lighter periods.
42	20	I've got bad back aches and terrible acne, as well as bloating.
42	21	Not only did I escape mood swings, weight gain, acne, nausea, etc., but my usual menstrual symptoms (bloating, cramps, breakouts) have become almost nonexistent.
42	22	I've had no acne.
42	23	I virtually have no acne.
42	24	I never had problems with acne or mood swings ever, especially while on Microgestin.
42	25	Now that I'm taking Beyaz I have very bad acne and feel very depressed and lack luster.
42	26	And I also suffer from acne, my skin cleared right up in a week.
42	27	I originally was put on it to control my acne and heavy periods, and shortly after I began using it for birth control.
42	28	It has continued to help with my acne, and has lightened/shortened my periods significantly, but over the past year or so I've noticed a vast decrease in my sex drive.
42	29	Only pro: my mild acne seemed to clear up.
42	30	One month into it I was having terrible cystic acne, two months into it I had a severe panic attack.
42	31	My bleeding stopped, I've not had any mood changes, weight gain, acne, or anything.
42	32	As for acne, Beyaz controls it amazingly.
42	33	I had moderate acne before taking Beyaz and now I only breakout like once a month (it's usually only 2-3 pimples).
42	34	It treated my moderate acne, I never get any acne anymore.
42	35	The worst part is the acne.
42	36	No spotting, no increase in acne.
42	37	Don't have acne (never really had a problem with it before).
42	38	Also many mood swings, specially when my period is near all I want to do is cry, and acne was HORRIBLE.
42	39	It's great with acne and no weight gain or anything but I will say it's absolutely horrible with moods.
42	40	The only thing I can say that I don't like about Byaz is that if I miss a pill and take it when I remember it seems like over the next 2 or 3 days my acne flares up really bad, and I hate that.
42	41	I have TERRIBLE menstrual cramps, acne did clear up.
42	42	I have breast tenderness, bad cramps, acne and I am also very moody!
42	43	It works well as it prevents pregnancy, but so far, I've had very heavy periods and severe cramps and tons of chin acne.
42	44	I also went back on birth control for my skin, because I have bothersome acne.
42	45	However, my acne increased and I was tired all the time.
42	46	When I stopped taking the pill, my acne was 90% gone the next day!
42	47	I was off the pill for a month, and my acne still is very small (Which is good, because I used to have bad breakouts).
42	48	I had terrible acne and ridiculous bloating and weight gain all in my stomach area.
42	49	I normally have acne on a regular basis but it hasn't gotten worse but I am patiently waiting for it to get better.
42	50	Was on this pill for 2 months and had extreme mood swings, heavier periods, cramping and acne.
42	51	I already had a tubal ligation so Beyaz is for hormones and acne.
42	52	I was on two other birth controls and they made me gain weight and made my acne get ten times worse and did not help my cramps and I got badly depressed.
42	53	Since taking Beyaz my acne has not gone away completely but has not got worse.
42	54	My face started breaking out, I am very emotional and angry.
42	55	I am SO moody on Beyaz, fine one day and insane the next, crying for no reason, terrible all day headaches, and breaking out.
42	56	I was really nauseous for the first two weeks, my face is still breaking out (not because of the pill), cramps aren't bad but have not disappeared and my sex drive has decreased.
42	57	I'm starting my second month on it again and I am noticing more occasional pimples (that I remember getting prior to rajani).
42	58	GIANT pimples everywhere.
42	59	I never got pimples before when I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen.
42	60	Now my periods are lighter, cramps are milder, migraines are gone, and I did not experience any major side effects (no weight gain or moodiness!).
42	61	My periods were always regular, minimal breakthrough bleeding (only occurring when I missed a pill or 2), no cramps, 3-4 day periods with very light bleeding.
42	62	Three to four days before I expect my period I get nauseous, dizzy/faint, and get HORRIBLE cramps.
42	63	This pill made me gain a bunch of weight, frequent breast pain, and horrible cramps.
42	64	My cramps aren't as bad, bleeding is much lighter than it used to be, hormones are 1,000 times more steady, and best of all: only 4 periods per year!
42	65	Only drawback is that I get random menstrual-like cramps, but they're very light, don't even need to take ibuprofen, it's more of a small annoyance than anything.
42	66	The first week, I became very emotional and light menstrual bleeding and cramps.
42	67	The second week my bleeding became heavier and cramps turned into preassure in my lower abdominal area.
42	68	Week 3 I started bleeding light with minor cramps.
42	69	The cramps were no longer minor they were just unbearable that I had to take Norco and Ibuprofen at the same time just to take the edge off.
42	70	I began getting terrible cramps (not normal for me) and even worse back aches (normal but not this severe) I was crying uncontrollably over my 'friend' who hadn't texted me that day and went through at least 3 uncontrollable rage spells, and got so exhausted, I couldn't keep my eyes open (I go through insomnia, one bonus about this pill is that I got A LOT of sleep) this month its worse, I can't even speak to my Dr. without wanting to scream.
42	71	Period has been light and no cramps!
42	72	Since I've started this, my stomach hurts a lot kinda like cramps, I have headaches, my breasts have gotten a lot bigger and they hurt to barely be touched, I also see to have gained weight obviously with my breast being bigger.
42	73	Easy periods almost no cramps it was too good to be true.
42	74	Very bad cramps.
42	75	I've been taking Beyaz for about 5 years now, I started when I was 14 because of severe cramps.
42	76	It worked great for a while but in the last few months I have experienced spotting and longer periods with more severe cramps.
42	77	I love the pill, however, I get really bad cramps when my period comes.
42	78	I now have very painful cramps just before and on my period.
42	79	I will take cramps over how I was acting any day of the week.
42	80	I was originally taking Microgestin for birth control for a little over a year and I started to experience extreme cramps that kept me from classes on some days.
42	81	I used to have really bad cramps when I would get my period; however, that is practically non-existent now.
42	82	My cramps and period length were reduced significantly and I have loved this pill.
42	83	I have also experienced terrible leg cramps and fatigue like never before.
42	84	I hardly have cramps or bloating.
42	85	Now I am starting to get extremely agitated at the smallest things, crying for no reason, extreme headaches, and am getting cramps like I used to without birth control.
42	86	I'll post again when I've been on it longer about weight gain, mood swings, cramps, etc.
42	87	My period is longer, my cramps are bad and I am emotional - which is crazy because I was never emotional when I was on Yaz or no birth control!
42	88	I have noticed that sometimes my bad cramps I used to have are starting to return.
42	89	For my cramps, it didn't do a single thing.
42	90	I still get cramps that make me want to curl in a ball all day.
42	91	I was told it would help my cramps and period, but I guess my body doesn't like that.
42	92	I didn't notice any weight gain, but the best part was Beyaz sorted my monthly cramps.
42	93	I started taking the pill because of horrible period cramps that would make me so sick and incapable of doing anything, it helped.
42	94	My periods became much lighter with less cramps.
42	95	I get bad cramps, although this month they seem to have subsided as today is the first of my placebo pills and no cramps this month.
42	96	This is my first birth control pill I've ever been on so I don't have anything to compare it to but I am 16 years old and have 11 day periods which are extremely heavy with terrible cramps, fatigue, and headaches.
42	97	I did have some slight cramps for the first week but they were nothing compared to what I've been on.
42	98	I am on the first day of the placebo and so far no bleeding but I do have awful cramps again which I thought the pill was supposed to take care of this.
42	99	I don't think I've ever felt this bloated ever and I NEVER get cramps on my period, but I'm having cramps with this pill.
42	100	My face was clear, my period was light and it worked magic on my ABSOLUTELY UNBEARABLE cramps.
42	101	My periods were so light, and next to no cramping!
42	102	Started 2nd pack as the bleeding and cramping still continues.
42	103	My skin is noticeably clearer, it has helped to reduce cramping and a heavy flow.
42	104	I had been taking Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 for 2 years until it started giving me bad cramping and breakthrough bleeding on the active pills.
42	105	My period was lighter and the cramping wasn't that bad.
42	106	Had no weight gain and no cramping or back aches on my period.
42	107	I was placed on this because I am having unbearable cramping and pain when having sex.
42	108	I couldn't handle even general PMS: bloating, cramping, achy body, emotional roller coaster, break-outs, not to mention feeling tired and irritable.
42	109	I haven't had a real period in several months since Yaz would just make me have cramping, not actually bleeding.
42	110	My periods were much less crampy and painful,  my skin didn't change at all.
42	111	However, I have had spotting all through the first month, which the doctor said was normal so I have no complaints other than one really big one.
42	112	I was not on any contraceptive previously, and when I started my Safyral regimen my ONLY side effect was very light spotting for the first month.
42	113	I have had no side effects minus minor spotting.
42	114	I have occasional breakthrough bleeding, but it's just spotting, nothing big, no mood swings but once a month my belly bloats a little bit.
42	115	I've also experienced spotting eight months into taking it.
42	116	The breast pains are unbearable, but the irregular bleeding and spotting have stopped.
42	117	Also towards the end of the pack I started spotting a lot.
42	118	I did spot through pretty much the whole second month BUT that has happened with every birth control I have been on, so I think it is just my body.
42	119	I don't know if it's me but I've been feeling nauseous on day 5 and a tiny headache here and there.
42	120	I experienced just about no side effects so far, no unusual weight gain, headaches, or cravings.
42	121	I had no problems but towards the end of the cycle I had terrible attitude, was very emotional, nauseous and too many headaches.
42	122	I also get headaches more than usual, and have gained about 4lbs and cannot lose weight at all.
42	123	It gave me the WORST headaches.
42	124	Maybe if I waited the whole 3 months, it would've straightened out but I just couldn't deal with the awful headaches.
42	125	That went away and I started getting headaches.
42	126	My skin is very broken out, have a lot of headaches and nausea.
42	127	But I don't have any headaches anymore.
42	128	I have been developing pretty severe headaches, and I have also been feeling nauseous.
42	129	I've had minor headaches and feeling bloated.
42	130	So far I have noticed increased minor headaches and nausea the first few days.
42	131	Now I have headaches almost daily and am extremely moody.
42	132	I have daily headaches.
42	133	I have also had headaches.
42	134	The cons: I too craved sugar after starting this pill, I had hair loss the first few weeks, my vision has became a problem especially in florescent lighting, started having headaches, I feel more tired and breathing has become heaver then normal, and breast tenderness.
42	135	My hunger has increased and I get headaches more often than usual.
42	136	But now my life is back on track and I deal with no emotional or hormonal effects from this pill, no nausea, no weight gain, and only headaches that went away after 2 - 3 months.
42	137	But if I Forget to take it, it quickly reminds me with an awful migraine.
42	138	Two years later I am incredibly depressed and bloated before my period along with crazy migraines for 3-4 days straight.
42	139	Since starting this one I've seen much less facial hair, my skin is clearing up, I'm losing weight, and I've had my first cycle with no migraines which is a huge deal for me.
42	140	Recently I have noticed aversions to certain foods, nausea, severe migraines, and lack of sleep.
42	141	My skin in flawless, but recently I've had severe migraines.
42	142	I feel very nauseous and have severe migraines, loss of appetite extremely tired, also I have a nasty taste in my mouth that just won't go away no matter how much I brush floss or mouthwash.
42	143	I've noticed from time to time I will go through a month where my sex drive is gone but I think that's typical of many other birth controls.
42	144	However my sex drive isn't as high.
42	145	Sometimes I do feel a little blue, and my sex drive is definitely lower.
42	146	I also had dryness and a pretty low sex drive.
42	147	Best thing my sex drive is great.
42	148	The ONLY two problems I had that warranted me switching included a decreased sex drive, and multiple yeast infections.
42	149	I normally have a very high sex drive as well and lately it has decreased immensely.
42	150	My sex drive has stayed the same.
42	151	I haven't noticed a change in sex drive.
42	152	And my sex drive is almost completely gone and I'm more moody on the pill than off.
42	153	I am hot most of the time (I am normally cold) and my sex drive has increased.
42	154	The only side effects I have experienced is increase in breast size, increased sex drive and clearer skin.
42	155	I have zero sex drive and the thought of sex makes me ill when I am usually very sexually active.
42	156	Beyaz was good my first year, but as I continued to take it my libido short to none.
42	157	My libido is at about 90% when I am with my boyfriend.
42	158	None of the other side effects (clearer skin, increased libido) have been a problem to me in the slightest.
42	159	I was on the pill a little over 5 years and went off of the pill due to weight gain, anxiety, and always feeling bad.
42	160	Also: no weight gain for me!
42	161	Also, the weight gain.
42	162	My breasts have grown a substantial amount, but I do not have bad bloating or weight gain in other areas which is awesome.
42	163	I have no mood swings, bloating or weight gain-- I'm actually at my lowest weight.
42	164	No weight gain.
42	165	No weight gain either!!!
42	166	No weight gain or other side effects.
42	167	I didn't experience any weight gain, and though I was sometimes moody, it wasn't anything outside of normal PMS.
42	168	I was skeptical about taking Birth control because of side effects such as depression and weight gain.
42	169	It was my first time going on birth control so I was nervous about all the weight gain rumors.
42	170	I've been on Beyaz for almost a year, Since them I've gone through times of weight gain and loss which could just be my body's normal function.
42	171	I did have a little weight gain because of the carbohydrate cravings.
42	172	I did not experience any weight gain.
42	173	Now and I feel more bloated, depressed, and have experienced weight gain.
42	174	I've been on Yaz for awhile and had no problems and a few months ago I switched to BeYaz and noticed a weight gain so I switched.
42	175	Other than the weight gain it's not a bad birth control.
42	176	I haven't gained weight, but my face has broken out some over the past 1-2 months; it didn't for the longest time so I'm not sure whether there's a correlation to the Beyaz or not.
42	177	Instead, I have gained everywhere & although I constantly work out, I can't lose the weight.
42	178	I haven't gained any weight at all- this was my biggest fear and I'm so happy it didn't come true.
42	179	I tend to be a very happy and energetic person and honestly I was scared to lose that, I was VERY SURPRISED THOUGH, Beyaz hasn't changed my mood at all, I haven't gained weight and overall I feel fine!
42	180	The first birth control I was on I gained 15 lbs in 5 months, my doctor switched me to Yaz.
42	181	I have gained 12 lbs in 3 months of taking it!
42	182	But I gained around 10-15 pounds which, for my size isn't a bad thing, but the fact I don't fit in my pants comfortably now stinks.
42	183	Loestrin worked for a little bit but I gained 20 pounds quick.
42	184	I have gained quite a bit of weight.
42	185	I just started taking it and i am one week into it and I have already gained 6 pounds because my hunger has increased!
42	186	EXTREME nausea and vomiting after only one day.
42	187	When I first started using the pill, I experienced frequent nausea for almost a year.
42	188	I have experienced nausea, bloating, mood swings, sadness, depression, fatigue and just don't feel like my self anymore.
42	189	So far, my main complaint is nausea.
42	190	So I switched and began taking it at lunch with a yogurt and I have had no additional nausea.
42	191	BUT I started craving so many things and also nausea will come!
42	192	The only side effect I really notice at this point is nausea throughout the day and I feel tired all day.
42	193	The nausea is really bad around the afternoon every day, even though I take it at night.
42	194	The worst side effect I had was nausea.
42	195	It has cleared up my skin significantly but caused bad mood swings and nausea.
42	196	It made me tired and nauseous.
42	197	The first few days were ok, then I started noticing I got nauseous about an hour after taking it.
42	198	I was noticing that I was always tired, nauseous,  bloated, stomach pains, and eating all the time.
42	199	In the first few weeks of taking Beyaz I was very nauseous and vomited a few times.
42	200	The first 3 months were great..no acne..no crying...no anger or crazy mood swings.
42	201	However, I've been experiencing mood swings lately.
42	202	Cons: the mood swings are terrible, I am always irritated, every little thing bothers me, I am so rude to my husband.
42	203	However, I am switching because of the mood swings.
42	204	The only downside I have noticed to this medication, is that my mood swings were terrible the first couple weeks.
42	205	The mood swings stopped about 4 weeks in.
42	206	Completed week 1 and the mood swings started.
42	207	After stopping this pill, my mood swings diminished and I feel like my old self again.
42	208	I lost water weight from my previous birth control plus some, skin is clear, no unusual mood swings.
42	209	During the first month all through the second month I had horrible mood swings.
42	210	It was nearly the perfect pill for me: no weight change, no mood swings, I regulated to it immediately, it dramatically shortened my periods to 3-4 days and was exactly on time every single month.
42	211	I was switched from a normal hormone birth control because it caused terrible breakouts (which I had never had in my life) as well as severe mood swings.
42	212	I had a baby 2 months ago, and even through my pregnancy never felt any mood swings or depression.
42	213	There's no tiredness or mood swings before I get my period either.
42	214	I've had the worst mood swings.
42	215	I have been on Ortho Tricyclen Low and it gave me horrible mood swings, which this medicine has not.
42	216	I have had just about every side effect that has been listed except for the mood swings.
42	217	I have been on this for a month and have had a horrible experience with my mood change, I have always been a happy person, and now for the last week I am so depressed and I am constantly feeling a nervous feeling in my gut, like anxiety.
42	218	I'm nervous about switching pills, but I'm glad to know that I can go back on Beyaz if the others don't work out.
42	219	I was nervous because I searched the Internet over and over, and only found one good review for this pill so I thought I'd give my experience to people who are wanting to try this.
42	220	I grew emotional, started having anxiety problems.
42	221	In the beginning however I had pretty bad anxiety and was noticeably more emotional.
42	222	I have a history of depression and anxiety with panic attacks.
42	223	My anxiety level has raised a little and the bleeding is heavier than normal.
42	224	I discontinued because of severe anxiety that could or could not have been related to the birth control (it's hard to tell sometimes if the symptoms are the pill, or just you).
42	225	Then I started getting really depressed out of nowhere, feeling sad for no reason, trapped in my own body and then that led to anxiety attacks and anxiety about when is the next time I will have this terrible feeling again.
42	226	After stopping those pills my Gyno suggested Beyaz since I have a history of anxiety and depression, and I am SO glad he did.
42	227	Breast tenderness and bloating were also a factor.
42	228	I get mild bloating and breast tenderness just before my period which goes away with the start of my period.
42	229	Also, I had terribly sore breasts and white vaginal discharge every last week of active pills.
42	230	I was previously on Loestrin 24 (made me a raving lunatic), then on Lo Loestrin 10 (gave me no period at all, which made me uncomfortable and more susceptible to vaginal infections).
42	231	I was taking Yaz and it worked amazing for me but about 2 months ago I was put on Beyaz and have had a yeast infection both months.
42	232	If it weren't for the yeast infections at least, I would stay on it!
42	233	I have not had sex in over 6 months, this is the only possible explanation for my yeast infections.
43	1	All my acne disappeared, I went from an AA cup to a B cup in bra size, and it made my painful and irregular periods go away and make them bearable and regular.
43	2	I have had terrible mood swings and my acne has gotten significantly worse.
43	3	I began taking it because I had really bad acne and nothing I was doing was working.
43	4	The birth control pill Nikki improved my acne significantly after only a month of use.
43	5	Following that I tried numerous other brands and they either worsened my acne or depression, sometimes both.
43	6	Nikki is the only birth control pill I have found that does not trigger depression and has completely cleared my acne.
43	7	I got this for acne and it didn’t change my skin at all.
43	8	It didn’t change me physically - weight gain or bigger boobs or better/worse skin or bloating - except it made me hairy and depressed and didn’t fix my acne
43	9	I was originally put on TriSprintec to help with acne and it made it severely worse so my doctor switched me to Nikki almost a month ago.
43	10	I’ve been using it for the last 2 months and since I’ve started using it, I’ve had frequent migraines, mood swings, acne, and weight gain.
43	11	I did not have any unnecessary bleeding during the month which was great, my acne cleared up significantly and my periods were very regular and not that heavy.
43	12	I've also noticed more acne and some major mood swings.
43	13	This medication has made my acne severely worse.
43	14	I previously had the implanon bc in my arm, and it caused really bad acne and I always had really bad cramps even though I didn't have a period.
43	15	Other than that my skin is completely clear (and I've struggled with acne for a few years now), my sex drive has actually increased, and I haven't gained any weight.
43	16	It cleared up my acne and my boobs have gotten so much bigger.
43	17	I first used enkysence and it gave me bad nausea and horrible acne.
43	18	The good things I like about Zarah are that my acne has cleared up and I don't have any super crazy side effects....however my period lasts for about 6-7 days and it's very heavy the whole time...this is the worst my period has ever been.
43	19	I usually have a lot of acne and that has cleared up a lot already, which is a big plus!!
43	20	I was prescribed Loryna last summer and it cleared up some mild acne I had, and I tolerated it up until my second semester of college when I missed my period one month.
43	21	The cramping is the same, but I don't get PMS .This birth control is great if you are battling acne and PMS.
43	22	I am on my second pack of zarah and I started taking the pill because of my acne.
43	23	My family says my acne has gotten a little better but I don't see much of a difference.
43	24	I started this medication in an attempt to clear my moderate hormonal acne.
43	25	Not only did it help improve my self esteem and acne but it has also regulated my periods.
43	26	I've taken other birth control pills to treat my acne, and this one is the worst that I've been taking so far and I hope to stop it as soon as possible.
43	27	I started taking this pill because everything else gave me cystic acne.
43	28	I went on it because I had irregular periods and bad acne, especially on my back and chest.
43	29	I would say that my acne is about 90% clearer now; my chest and back acne is basically gone, but I've been noticing some breakouts on my face lately.
43	30	I had very bad PMDD and Loryna cleared all my symptoms including; awful headaches, acne, severe mood swings, literally the whole package.
43	31	I'm not pregnant either, my breasts went up to a 32DD, and my acne is slightly better than it was before.
43	32	I was on Jolessa for 4 years and always had constant spotting and bad acne, Sprintec for 4 months and had spotting and awful mood swings and periods, but Ocella is absolutely perfect.
43	33	I've been on it for 3 months now and it's cleared up most of my acne, I've had no spotting and no periods, and I've lost 8 pounds!
43	34	My old acne scars are clearing up and my emotions are very stable now.
43	35	Was an effective form of birth control and cleared up my acne spectacularly; however, I started getting horrible migraines during the week I was not taking the hormones.
43	36	Pros: maintained high sex drive, no change in natural lubrication, cystic cheek acne has improved, no mood swings, no weight gain, not pregnant  Cons: hungry all the time (don't give in to the cravings!)
43	37	The only good things about Zarah 28, was that it helped me not get pregnant, my acne cleared up slightly and my boobs grew.
43	38	Never gained weight, cleared up my acne so much, great 3-4 day period.
43	39	It improved my acne, mood swings, etc.
43	40	No change in acne, but weight gain, headaches, horrible heavy crampy periods, intense mood swings.
43	41	I use Zarah for my acne cause I have bad acne I started 2 months ago and it cleared my acne up it's just that now I have a few breakouts now and then and some scars from before.
43	42	I think this product is really helpful for acne, it works on some people like me and people are not the same so it might or might not work for you.
43	43	I haven't gained any weight but I've been noticing pimples popping up and I've never had this problem before I'm not sure if my hormones aren't used to it yet but the acne sucks & my breast have been tender also.
43	44	It cleared up my acne and helped a lot with period cramps.
43	45	I suffered from acne to the point that on some days I wouldn't leave my house.
43	46	My acne is completely gone and my skin is glowing.
43	47	Ive noticed my acne and blackheads have cleared up significantly, my appetite is under control and my moods are more even.
43	48	This is the first birth control I've been on, I mostly used it for acne at first.
43	49	But besides being super nausea all the time I had moodswings, did nothing for my acne, bad cramps, and anxiety.
43	50	I very rarely have acne and I haven't experience any mood swings or loss in libido.
43	51	It has completely gotten rid of my acne, and my periods are only 2 days now, with very little/ almost no cramps or pain.
43	52	Other birth control pills gave me mood swings, messed with my periods, or made my acne worse.
43	53	I suffer with mild acne and zarah made it worse.
43	54	I take it for acne, birth control, menstrual disorder premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
43	55	I had bleeding for 2 months straight, acne breakouts on my chest, back, and face.
43	56	Starting in elementary school, my acne was horrible.
43	57	At age 13, it morphed into a rare form of cystic acne.
43	58	Since being put on Ocella, my acne has decreased immensely, and stayed as regular types of breakouts rather than the cystic variety.
43	59	This is my first month taking it and I have gained weight, I have been super moody I keep lashing out at people and I dont even mean too, its making my acne worse.
43	60	I had issues with acne, depression and anxiety, weight loss, breakthrough bleeding, severe cramping, painful sex, and a million other things.
43	61	), cystic acne, loss of appetite yet weight gain.
43	62	this pill is extremely affective with me as a birth control and as an acne pill.
43	63	I am not sexually active therefore I took it more for my acne.
43	64	However, once I started Zarah I broke out SO bad on my chin and forehead, Its been about three weeks since I stopped and I am still suffering from acne.
43	65	If you are taking this pill merely just for acne, DO NOT DO IT.
43	66	I'm 25 and am basically taking birth control for acne.
43	67	My acne did not clear up at all!
43	68	I was prescribed this due to acne.
43	69	In a month or two I come toy cleared up the acne I got on my back and chest.
43	70	My acne decreased with the exception of the placebo pill week.
43	71	Last fall I broke out in some of the worst acne I've ever experienced.
43	72	I had deep rooted cystic acne all over my chin and jaw (area known for hormonal breakouts).
43	73	Zarah has cleared up my acne, which is a feat by itself.
43	74	Yes, it cleared up my acne but I've gained almost 10 lbs and cannot get rid of them!
43	75	When I first started it I was pretty moody and had some acne but after the first few months my skin was always clear and there was waay less moodiness.
43	76	I'm 27 now and decided to get back on the pill because I have hormonal adult acne and I HATE IT!
43	77	I got on loryna-in on my 2nd month and my acne is clear for a couple weeks then I'll break out (around my periods) I'm hoping the 3rd month will show even better improvements but all and all I'm happy with this pill.
43	78	I started taking this when I was 17 years old (now almost 22) and ordinary antibiotics weren't helping my acne problems.
43	79	No history of any acne during my teens.
43	80	But the positive is my breasts got a little bigger, I lost a little weight, and less acne.
43	81	I have gained 20 lbs eventhough I watch my diet and stay active, my acne has not cleared up, I spot 2-3 times a week, crave spicy foods a lot, sweets make me nauseous, I stay with headaches and constant mood swings.
43	82	As far as acne goes, I have mild acne & have not noticed an improvement.
43	83	I have hormonal acne and it's getting better slowly.
43	84	Other pills and the NuvaRing gave me very bad side effects (acne, moodiness, weight gain), but I've been taking Zarah now for almost 3 months and I've experienced no bad side effects.
43	85	It cleared up my acne beautifully and has been a very reliable form of contraception.
43	86	I originally got on Zarah and off the IUD because my doctor said it would help my acne but it didn't.
43	87	The IUD was amazing besides not helping or even causing my acne.
43	88	I've been on it for 2 months now, I switched to Ocella to treat moderate acne, so far I have noticed a slight decrease in breakouts but also noticed I have no self control over what I eat anymore and have gained weight I am an active person and I have noticed a change in weight.
43	89	I was moody on my periods (nothing new) and a big decrease in acne!
43	90	Overall a great product if you would like to see a decrease in acne, no weight gain, no pregnancy scares, no depression or moodiness for the most part.
43	91	I grew out of my acne problem ago but after the first month of taking Yaz I have started to breakout and the acne seems to get worse and worse the longer I take it.
43	92	Has also improved acne, which was another concern of mine.
43	93	Didn't help with my acne but no weight gain.
43	94	My acne cleared up for the first two months, but I broke out pretty bad during the third month.
43	95	But I gave it a month, and lo and behold, I started having more energy, my initial mood swings before the pill stopped, my abnormally painful and heavy period is ridiculously easy, my face and back acne have disappeared completely, and my bust even plumped up half a cup size.
43	96	Have been taking Ocella for 4 months, and at first the only things I noticed were positive; it cleared up the mild adult acne that I had developed around my jawline, and my breasts seemed to get bigger.
43	97	Cleared up moderate acne.
43	98	I usually get a very mild acne break out right before, as well as some cramps which don't last very long.
43	99	My acne has really cleared up after using so many different things out there to treat it.
43	100	All my life I have had severe acne...
43	101	Well Ocella has DEFINITELY eliminated my acne, that part has been wonderful.
43	102	Was originally on TriNessa and hated it; Tri made me extremely emotional and I started breaking out in cysts.
43	103	I had the IUD in for about 5 months and started breaking out almost immediately after i got it.
43	104	I have had no problems with the pill unless I forget to take it one day then I may breakout with pimples.
43	105	The first few days were a bit rough, I experienced some mood swings and negative thoughts, and some wild dreams, even a few pimples showed up.
43	106	No mood changes, lost some weight, no pimples, etc...but the nausea is ridiculous.
43	107	Irritable, cried 3x in past week and have developed a lot of pimples on my forehead and nose.
43	108	This birth control cleared my skin up the 2nd week I was on it, and I have had maybe a few zits here and there (3 or 4) but they usually go away right away.
43	109	I've learned that Zarah was causing weird breakouts around my chin that were just hard painful bumps that never turned into actual zits.
43	110	My periods are still pretty heavy, but it synced up with the pill pretty quick and my cramps aren’t too bad.
43	111	No painful cramps.
43	112	Pros, it regulated my period, ridded me of cramps, given me super clear skin and I am much less moody.
43	113	I've been on zarah for about 3 months no and the only complaint is that I get weird cramps occasionally.
43	114	No spotting, cramps, weight gain, or emotional changes.
43	115	I just recently finished my first pack of Ocella and I don't have many things to complain about except the cramps during my period!!!
43	116	I got on birth control because I am in a serious relationship but I am not ready for children and I wanted something to help me with my bad cramps and vomiting on the first days of my period.
43	117	My cramps weren't as painful or etc but then I started getting severe stomach pain and guess what?
43	118	I've had horrible cramps, no sex drive, and when I do have sex I am so dry to where it hurts to even have sex.
43	119	Like in this case the inflammation that causes my deadly cramps.
43	120	I was also prone ever since my first period, which was pretty late, I would skip months at a time and then have terrible cramps, periods, and awful moods.
43	121	It's pretty heavy with minimal cramps.
43	122	My cramps are more intense and my period is heavier and lasts longer (went from ~4 days to ~7 days).
43	123	I do have horrible cramps and bloating.
43	124	Painful cramps and heavy bleeding to the point I needed to change a super plus tampon every hour.
43	125	Before, I had unpredictable periods (often skipping once every several months for no reason), painful cramps, and a period lasting up to 7 whole days.
43	126	Now I have a 99% clear face, a regular light-medium period lasting 4-5 days and NO cramps!
43	127	The only thing is my cramps during my period were down right deadly but i hear that gets better over time.
43	128	I first started on the pill about 5 months ago and it helped a little with my cramps that were horrible before I started the pill.
43	129	I used to have terrible cramps during my period with a very heavy flow and now it's wicked light and virtually no cramps!
43	130	I've been having occasional random cramps throughout this month, which was manageable, but now that I'm in the middle of the sugar pill week, my pain is terrible.
43	131	These are the worst cramps of my life.
43	132	I have no cramps whatsoever.
43	133	My cramps are unbearable for days.
43	134	My periods are now much shorter (3-4 days long) and lighter, my skin has been clearer than usual, and since taking Zarah I have had absolutely no period cramps, which I used to get very badly.
43	135	No more rashes and periods are WAY better, they are light and barely any cramps and they last 3- 4 days tops, come like clock work for me now.
43	136	My period was a lot lighter and no cramps, just a little bloat.
43	137	I get mild cramps now where before there were none.
43	138	My periods on Ocella are quite light and last only 4-5 days; cramps are usually mild.
43	139	Pros: Periods were lighter, cramps hardly existed, not pregnant.
43	140	I've always been a happy, outgoing person, but Ocella made me upset at random times and now that I'm off it, my period is heavier than before and the cramps are worse.
43	141	Decreases my horrid mood swings, decreases my cramps and decreases noticeable ovarian cysts.
43	142	Virtually no side effects and has practically eliminated menstrual cramps.
43	143	Overall it has done its job of keeping me kid-free but I get horrible cramps a day or two before my period and during it.
43	144	Periods are definitely shorter and lighter so I don't understand the increase in cramps.
43	145	The only cons I could have about this product is around the time of my period I am extremely bloated and I get terrible cramps.
43	146	I have no cramps and my skin cleared up.
43	147	It helped my cramps, shortened my period by 2 day, and helped clear out my skin.
43	148	Otherwise I've had shorter periods, lighter periods but pretty bad cramps.
43	149	I use Ocella and my only complaints are that I am moody occasionally and my periods are heavier and I get very bad cramps, which I never used to get.
43	150	I now have 3 day cramp free periods and the clearest skin I have ever had in my life.
43	151	I bleed heavy, cramp and have migraines for at least 10 days.
43	152	I also get cramping and headaches.
43	153	I have started cramping and spotting two weeks before I am supposed to start.
43	154	Not only that, but also I have had the easiest periods with no cramping.
43	155	gross brown spotting 9-10 days before period is due (I had hoped this would regulate as I adjusted to it but no luck), some cramping on first day of (light)  periods, slightly more emotional (but no big deal at all).
43	156	I also suffered from severe cramping to the point of fainting and vomiting before bc and I have not experienced any cramping since I started taking Zarah.
43	157	I recommend it for anyone with skin conditions, irregular periods and bad cramping.
43	158	My skin is completely clear, I have no depression and anxiety, it did not change my weight, there is no breakthrough bleeding, severe cramping, or painful sex.
43	159	My cramping was never as bad and I never got pregnant which is the main point!
43	160	No significant weight gain, No cramping during period, Period lasts for a shorter amount of time, No heavy bleeding (no spotting, either).
43	161	I have gained no weight, have lighter periods, light cramping, and have only one issue.
43	162	Periods lighter/shorter with less cramping.
43	163	BUT, I have gained weight, and on my period week my flow was very heavy and crampy, plus it lasted the whole 7 days....eww, I am not used to that.
43	164	First month I was getting anxiety around my period time, crying spells, very crampy, a heavy flow, and mood swings(my poor boyfriend).
43	165	However, I rate it at an 8 because I have had frequent light spotting in between periods and they are not as regular as they normally would be.
43	166	My doctor switched me to Zarah after my last birth control (the generic form of Yaz) gave me bad spotting.
43	167	I switched to this one because my precious BC was causing spotting.
43	168	I have no periods ever or spotting.
43	169	By the next day I started spotting and have my period ever since.
43	170	I have spotting EVERY DAY!
43	171	I began Zarah when I kept having spotting while taking zovia.
43	172	Recently I have forgotten to take it for like 3days and spotting does arrive, other than that I highly recommend.
43	173	She also got some spotting on her face, like brown spots that look like freckles.
43	174	Being on only active pills, I usually have spotting once or twice a year due to missing a pill or taking it more than 12 hours late.
43	175	On the plus side -- my skin looks amazing and no spotting like I get on Vestura..but these side effects are too much!
43	176	The only problem I had was spotting.
43	177	Overall most days I just feel sick and my period was just light spotting, so I guess that was the only benefit coming from week long periods.
43	178	Second, I experience spotting between periods.
43	179	And this last month, I started spotting 2 weeks in.
43	180	I never experienced any headaches or spotting or anything like that and I'm not pregnant, so in those aspect Ocella was great.
43	181	It literally felt like I had a cut in a certain spot.
43	182	I was on Implanon for a month and lost half my breast size, and spotted with extreme dryness everyday.
43	183	I tried Nikki for less than 1 month and for the first week I thought it was good as my old pill but then, after 10 days I started to have: nausea, problem with my eyesight, headache and vaginal discharge.
43	184	I did gain some weight on this med but nothing too serious and I did have a headache when I first started this medication & on my periods.
43	185	I had headaches the first few days but I’m assuming my body just was not used to it.
43	186	What I loved about it is I felt great on it -periods were light, my headaches I had from previous bc were gone, I lost weight and even felt more balanced mood wise on this pill.
43	187	Nausea, headaches, tired 24/7, no motivation...
43	188	I started BC because I had severe headaches, nausea, and dizziness when on my periods.
43	189	However, after 4 months I've been very nauseous and have had severe headaches and stomach pain.
43	190	I have had really bad headaches.
43	191	But no emotional turmoil or headaches - which is what I'm facing now.
43	192	No side effects(nausea, headaches,etc)
43	193	It reduced my headaches and dysmenorrhea, but I'm not sure if the former is just psychosomatic.
43	194	When I first took Zarah I got these major headaches at first and tender breast but after three weeks the headaches went away.
43	195	I also have constant headaches and eat junk food constantly and have gained 5 lbs.
43	196	I got headaches the first week.
43	197	No headaches, nausea, mood swings, or noticeable change in sex drive, which seem to be a problem for a lot of other women.
43	198	I have not experienced nausea, headaches, and definitely no decrease in sex drive.
43	199	I also have been getting headaches quite frequently but I don't know if I can attribute that to this medication.
43	200	So far I've had bad nausea, dizziness, headaches, and been extremely tired.
43	201	I get debilitating migraine headaches during the first few days of the placebo week (from hormone drop), and the week before my period I have severe constipation, which affects my body image (I feel unattractive).
43	202	I also get a migraine for about 3 days straight when I get my period.
43	203	I've been getting chest pain and rapid heart beats, I have absolutely no sex drive and I have been experiencing the worst migraines of my life.
43	204	I also have migraines.
43	205	I have been having heavy uncontrollable bleeding, terrible stomach pain, fatigue, nauseous and migraines.
43	206	Regulated my periods, took away migraines, took away me throwing up whenever my period came, and I never gained weight from it.
43	207	I have never had any moodiness, and it has helped with my time of the month migraines I would get.
43	208	But I've experienced a huge decrease in my sex drive and more bothersome than that, I have been getting migraines at least three times a week regularly since I started taking it.
43	209	I was on this pill for about two years, besides it killing my sex drive I loved it!
43	210	Face is absolutely clear, weight is constant, sex drive is amazing, periods are light, PMS is a little higher than usual but nothing excessive.
43	211	I've also gained a significant amount of weight and had mood swings and a heavily decreased sex drive.
43	212	At first, I loved this pill, besides the fact that it gave me terrible mood swings and no sex drive.
43	213	Finally I decided to stop taking it 1 month ago and I already lost 5 lbs, am 10x happier, and my sex drive is back.
43	214	My face is clear, sex drive normal.
43	215	I gained 20 pounds, my sex drive decreased significantly and I've felt depressed ever since.
43	216	It is effective in preventing pregnancy, and I have not had a low sex drive like some others.
43	217	Didn't notice much change in sex drive which is good.
43	218	At first, my sex drive was higher (even though I've never actually acted on it), but that has calmed down now.
43	219	I think the most noticeable things I can remember or slight dryness and a decreased sex drive.
43	220	No weight gain and sex drive was great.
43	221	I am not sexually active (never have been), so I'm not sure how effective it is for me actual birth control-wise, but my sex drive is much lower.
43	222	It definitely decreased my sex drive a lot and I started getting a lot of discharge every day.
43	223	After reading another review I have noticed my sex drive go wayyy up as well.
43	224	The downs I found beside the weight is I have zero sex drive!
43	225	Of course there was the noticeable decline in sex drive, but that didn't bother me much.
43	226	Never had any problems: Cleared my skin, breasts grew, periods were light, sex drive was not really affected.
43	227	The other thing was that I have zero sex drive and I can't lose weight.
43	228	Didn't affect my sex drive.
43	229	I have a low sex drive.
43	230	However I also have found that I have ABSOLUTELY NO sex drive.
43	231	I am only 21 and before taking Ocella I had enough sex drive for me and other people, but now nothing.
43	232	Ocella has done the job as far as preventing pregnancy, but I have had mood swings bad enough to start taking Welbutrin, I've gained some weight, and MY SEX DRIVE IS TERRIBLE.
43	233	The mood changes and the HUGE sex drive decline is the reason why I will be changing again.
43	234	Low libido, low tolerance for any person in my life.
43	235	Now that I'm having sex regularly, my libido is really low.
43	236	Slight weight gain but it went away after a month.
43	237	Makes you feel depressed for no reason, and makes you have no feeling of fullness so you're always hungry which I think is why so many people have weight gain from this pill.
43	238	No weight gain.
43	239	I haven't had any weight gain.
43	240	My  skin is clear with no crazy mood swings and  no weight gain.
43	241	No weight gain at all, I lose weight more than gain.
43	242	No weight gain or loss, and allows me to completely skip my period by starting a new pack rather than taking placebos.
43	243	I haven't noticed any weight gain or  anything.
43	244	My biggest concern was weight gain.
43	245	I have had zero weight gain on this medication and my skin is always clear.
43	246	I began taking Zarah in hopes that it wouldn't cause weight gain, however, I have gained 5lbs in the first week.
43	247	no weight gain thank god.
43	248	It didn't cause any weight gain, or mood changes.
43	249	However, I noticed some weight gain and realized that I have horrible mood swings.
43	250	That said, my skin cleared up and I had no weight gain.
43	251	Didn't have any moody side effects and no weight gain.
43	252	I have not had much weight gain and my cravings are less than normal.
43	253	weight gain (even though I am on a strict 1500 diet that didn't change), fatigue, sensory changes (smell/taste).
43	254	I haven't had any huge changes in emotions or weight gain.
43	255	I have experienced weight gain (8 lbs) caused by eating all my cravings.
43	256	Possibly light weight gain but I think it's manageable and not extreme.
43	257	I did not notice any substantial weight gain.
43	258	I do have a bit more weight gain with this.
43	259	No weight gain, nausea, etc.
43	260	Had severe mood swings, dry eyes to the point of not being able to wear contacts, weight gain, breast tenderness.
43	261	Acne hasn't really cleared up, and do have some weight gain but my eating habits aren't the best either so I wont blame it on that.
43	262	I'm sure weight gain would be on my complaint list but you just have to maintain a really good diet and exercise whenever you can.
43	263	This is my first time using this product and so far I haven’t gained any weight, if anything my appetite has changed in ways that I’m not as hungry as I usually am.
43	264	I gained 10 pounds in the first 2 months of the pack and was having mood swings all the time.
43	265	Now they switched to Nikki and I've gained 10+ pounds in 2 months!
43	266	2 years into it, I'd gained about 10 lbs in 3 months (without any lifestyle change) and NOTHING I did would help me lose the weight.
43	267	I've also gained weight.
43	268	I gained 15 pounds, have horrible anxiety about stupid things, and cry on the drop of a dime.
43	269	BUT I gained an insane amount of weight with little change to my diet or exercise.
43	270	I gained about 30 pounds during that time and was super bloated with a lot of fluid retention.
43	271	Doubt it: Took Gianvi for 4 years and gained 5 lbs.
43	272	Went off Nikki, gained 10 pounds.
43	273	I have also broken out the worst I have in a very long time, as well as gained five pounds.
43	274	I haven't gained weight but I can seem to lose any either but that's not really a problem for me at this time.
43	275	Overall no major side effects but I do think I've gained weight.
43	276	My skin looks great and haven't gained any weight.
43	277	I have definitely gained weight and having a hard time losing it.
43	278	Two months have now passed, I'm nauseous, I've gained 8 pounds and I'm also tired often, honestly I thought I was pregnant (I'm not)...
43	279	I've also gained weight since going off the pill.
43	280	First, I've gained 6 pounds in 4 months with little change to my diet.
43	281	I gained no weight (but was eating very healthy and stayed active).
43	282	In that time, I gained 20 pounds.
43	283	Feeling no nausea or weird pains either.
43	284	She prescribed me Ocella (generic for Yasmin) and the first two initial days all I experienced was nausea, which is to be expected, but about a week into it I got the worst anxiety attacks... worse than I’ve ever had along with a very rapid heartbeat.
43	285	I had slight nausea when on Tri Sprintec but now it's terrible and I can barely eat.
43	286	I had a huge nausea and vomiting problem with the last one.
43	287	No nausea and vomiting, only had two really nauseous days in this last week of active pills.
43	288	I had shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, and chest pain.
43	289	I don't get nausea and only had mood swings the first week.
43	290	However, I've experienced many mood swings and depressive-like symptoms as well as more nausea and tenderness in my breasts.
43	291	Mild nausea when I first started but that has gone away.
43	292	I have one more day on Zarah and here are the side effects I've experienced in that time: nausea, severe moodiness, dizziness, yeast infection, swollen tongue (?!
43	293	Definitely having bouts of nausea.
43	294	But I'll take nausea over no weight gain/slight weight loss any day.
43	295	the nausea was so bad and i was only like 3 weeks into my first pack.
43	296	I had nausea only during the first 4 months of taking it.
43	297	I've been on Ocella for about two months now (and I was on it for about two years a while ago), but this time around I'm suffering from terrible nausea.
43	298	I did have some nausea but that cleared up too.
43	299	I've been experiencing elevated blood pressure and this is causing some other ill feelings such as nausea and shortness of breath, which immediately triggers anxiety attacks.
43	300	The most I have felt is some breast tenderness close to my period which I have always had and sometimes some mild nausea my first 2 days or so on the pill during the first active week.
43	301	I caused nausea for me.
43	302	For the four months I've been taking it, my only complaint is the multiple periods of breakthrough bleeding, bloating and nausea.
43	303	When I first started Zarah I was nauseated on and off for about a month.
43	304	Ending my 4th day taking this BC and I've been extremely nauseous since yesterday, didn't even go to work today.
43	305	I then tried a couple other ones but they all made me nauseous as well.
43	306	I know, that is not long enough, but, I have noticed I become nauseous here and there.
43	307	My hands and left side of my face would go numb, I would get nauseous, and I would be incapable of doing anything but lie there because I could not fall asleep because of the pain.
43	308	For the first 1 month it was fine then after that I started getting nauseous a few hours after taking the pill.
43	309	Then the 3rd month I would get really nauseous that I would almost throw up and this was happening a few days a week and I missed to much school, so I finally stopped taking it.
43	310	But besides the breast tenderness I felt nauseous, tired, I would randomly vomit after meals, I had no control over my bladder.
43	311	It made me a little nauseous I'm the beginning, but nothing like what other bc pills did to me.
43	312	I switched to Ocella 3 weeks later because Ortho Tri-Cyclen made me nauseous and made my gums itchy.
43	313	Before that I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen (which made me very nauseous so I switched).
43	314	When I started Zarah I was nauseous all the time.
43	315	Occasionally, I feel nauseous around my period, but that side-effect occurs with or without birth control.
43	316	I never had heavy bleeding or clotting... but I would get so dizzy I would be close to fainting if I was on my feet too much.
43	317	It regulated my pain and dizziness during my periods.
43	318	It wasn't a bad birth control other than the mood swing and anxiety.
43	319	I never had any mood swings, just normal PMS like everyone has.
43	320	I became very emotional and had drastic mood swings.
43	321	All previous ones had break through bleeding, mood swings & one gave me out of control yeast infections.
43	322	I've been having severe mood swings and crying spells, which never happened before.
43	323	I haven't noticed any major mood swings or changes in my mood.
43	324	No mood swings, either.
43	325	It has controlled my breakthrough bleeding, but the last few months I've been experiencing EXTREME mood swings, depression, anxiety, anger/rage...
43	326	I'm having worsening mood swings from mildly depressed to extremely giddy, sometimes several in a day.
43	327	Only downside is mild mood swings, but nothing unmanageable.
43	328	I've had terrible mood swings.
43	329	I have been on Ocella for 6 months and all 6 months have been terrible I've been gaining weight which makes me extremely depressed and I've had really bad mood swings.
43	330	I usually use Ocella (been using for 4 years) and switched to Zarah for my vacation because the pharmacy was out, but wow, it triggered huge mood swings and a deep depression the 2nd week in,  By the 3rd week, I was crying every morning and feeling in a slump for hours on end.
43	331	Mood swings sometimes but it was far better than Implanon.
43	332	Zarah seemed perfectly fine when it came to controlling my mood swings and not getting me prego!
43	333	After starting this medication, I started to have symptoms of depression and anxiety, irritability and mood swings.
43	334	These mood swings are laughable - when I catch myself crying because I didn't share my sandwhich with my two dogs.
43	335	No out of the ordinary mood swings, sickness, or tiredness.
43	336	Ocella cleared my face up and did not give me any mood swings.
43	337	I also got awful mood swings.
43	338	It made me actually lose a few pounds because it maintained my appetite and my mood swings were very low other than around the time of my period.
43	339	I have retained so much fluid, and this medicine caused crazy mood swings and irritability.
43	340	I've lost those 5lbs, no more mood swings and I feel much better.
43	341	Also no mood swings either.
43	342	I don't know what it is about this pill, but my body went haywire -- mood swings, swollen tender breasts, a few lbs.
43	343	The first month of taking it I had a couple of side effects, which were bad mood swings and constipation.
43	344	I switched to Ocella from Levora because Levora was giving me really bad mood swings.
43	345	This side effect decreased dramatically when I switched to Ocella, but I do still get mood swings quite often.
43	346	I normally have light mood swings before my period, but this has been ten times worse and nonstop for the week and a half that I've been on Ocella.
43	347	Mood swings were intermittent and manageable.
43	348	I would get the WORST mood swings when I PMSed that my friends would purposely avoid me.
43	349	Since switching to Ocella I have had a MAJOR decrease in mood swings.
43	350	But since my mood swings are gone I a would completely recommend Ocella.
43	351	Always tired, and my mood swings were really ridiculous.
43	352	But I had horrible MOOD SWINGS!
43	353	Crying almost very day and mood swings are crazy!
43	354	I've been on it for a year and the only problem I've run into is horrible mood swings and depression the entire sugar pill week.
43	355	Don’t have any mood changes and sleep fine.
43	356	I didn't experience any mood changes except for the first week on this pill as my body got used to it.
43	357	My mood changes frequently too.
43	358	Now I'm nervous about switching to something else because that's just outrageous to pay, especially in this economy.
43	359	BUT I have recently stopped this med I was EXTREMELY** anxious during the time I was on this medication.
43	360	I've became very depressed and anxious.
43	361	I also am highly anxious...I'm an anxious person to begin with but with the pill for this week I've been near panic attack a lot and that hasn't happened in a decade.
43	362	I took myself off of it a week ago, and I feel so much better, I'm less anxious and moody and the pain and swelling.
43	363	This has never happened with any pill I've taken the anxiousness scared me.
43	364	This pill also goes well with anxiety medication I take so I highly recommend it.
43	365	Since being on this my anxiety has sky rocketed, I bleed for a few days stop then bleed for a days or longer and repeat this has been happening since day 1 of taking this pill.
43	366	I have had anxiety my entire life but never have I experienced what I went through with this.
43	367	The only thing I worry about is anxiety has increased, but so have other factors in my life that could cause increased anxiety so I don't want to blame it solely on BC.
43	368	Zarah has drospirenone as its progesterone and is proven to help calm some of the effects of PMDD and other anxiety.
43	369	She got anxiety for the first week and started crying every single day.
43	370	After 5 weeks on Ocella, I had an anxiety attack at my boyfriends house and the following week I experienced the heaviest depression I have ever felt in my life.
43	371	I have extreme fatigue, irritability, moodiness and a little breast pain.
43	372	I switched to this from Aranelle after having horrible depression and extremely sore breasts.
43	373	Originally on Syeda, was switched to Ocella last month and this month and have had a continuous yeast infection.
44	1	I went on Alesse originally to see if it would help my acne.
44	2	As soon as I switched pills, all the acne cleared up.
44	3	I’d say it’s worth giving a shot, but it definitely didn’t work for me personally in clearing up acne.
44	4	I am in my third package and I have to tell you that I cannot be more satisfied and happy with this pill, no side effects at all, my period comes normally, I have no acne, no headaches, no cramps, no spotting, no weight gain, no nothing, and most important no pregnacies LOL!
44	5	Before birth control my periods were 5-7 days and heavy, no pain or cramps at all and no acne.
44	6	I am currently starting my placebo pills on my second month and let me tell you that my acne is worse than it has ever been in my life.
44	7	I have had acne before but never to such degree.
44	8	I switched to falmina about 5 months ago and immediately noticed an increase in acne.
44	9	It gave me terrible acne.
44	10	I have never had acne more than an occasional pimple, but it made my face red and bumpy all over, and it has stayed ever since!
44	11	Mild acne, extreme moodiness, and weight gain.
44	12	Its also helped a lot with acne, gave me lighter periods and little to no cramps at all.
44	13	After the first week I broke out with the worst cystic acne I have ever had in my life.
44	14	I was breaking out in cystic acne, my breasts hurt, I had gained weight, my appetite was immense, etc.
44	15	I also had mild acne before I started taking it, and it developed into cystic acne within a week, and didn’t clear up.
44	16	I’ve been off it for over a month now, still have the cystic acne, but my mood and sex drive came back up.
44	17	The only thing it has done for me, is give me acne.
44	18	I've been on it for just over 6 months now, it has helped with acne and regulating periods.
44	19	Initially I did have some acne, but that cleared up after the first month.
44	20	On top of that I've gotten severe acne, I don't usually get acne, my skin is clear but once I started taking the pill my acne grew worse it's really bad now.
44	21	I haven't had acne since my teen years and this brand caused me to break out.
44	22	No weight gain and no acne or hair loss or any of the other things people have unfortunately described.
44	23	Since starting Falmina, I've had terrible cystic acne all over my chin (I usually have clear skin).
44	24	I used Aubra for two functions: as a contraceptive, and as a way to reduce acne.
44	25	At first, I wanted to use it as a birth control & to clear up my acne (which wasn't that bad; I had light/moderate acne with no cysts).
44	26	However, my acne got A LOT WORSE (severe cystic acne) and I didn't know it was from that pill.
44	27	I had acne like I never had before and I started experiencing violent headaches (at least 1 or 2 per week).
44	28	I tried a lot of treatment for acne, but none of them worked.
44	29	I started using this alesse when I got pretty moderate/severe acne (no cysts though).
44	30	It did improve my acne (I only had light/moderate acne) but I coupled it with minocycline and topical clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide and the retin-A gel (0.05%).
44	31	I switched to yaz because I heard it was better for acne (which it was) but then I got crazy mood swings and emotions so I switched back.
44	32	I don't have acne prone skin so I didn't experience any problems while on the pill.
44	33	My skin was clear but once I started taking this I had the worst acne.
44	34	I've only been on alesse for a week but I'm already quitting it... no physical pain or acne or anything like that, but I'm experiencing these horrible mood swings.
44	35	I have gained 15 lb, have acne on my face and chest and horrible mood swings as well as periods of sadness.
44	36	No acne and no weight gain.
44	37	The pros of this pill were decreased acne and my boobs got bigger!
44	38	I've never had acne and my face broke out terribly.
44	39	I've been depressed, acne is horrible, I have horrible food cravings, not to mention awful cramps to where I can't even move.
44	40	The only side effects I had on this were spotty, random periods, and acne.
44	41	I can handle the breakthrough bleeding, but the acne was just awful.
44	42	I have acne prone skin, and Yaz totally cleared it up, but made me gain weight.
44	43	When I switched to Alesse, I lost weight (not entirely due to changing the pill) but my acne came back horribly.
44	44	I would recommend this ONLY if you don't have issues with acne.
44	45	I'm 18, about 105lb, and the most I was concerned about was getting bad acne on this pill.
44	46	It all cleared up within a few days though and I haven't had worse acne than before taking the pill.
44	47	I started experiencing major headaches, getting acne, becoming extremely depression, no sex drive at all, increased anxiety, and I was just overall moody and irritated at everything.
44	48	I originally started talking this BC (having never before taken any others) as an attempt to regulate my acne.
44	49	It did help the acne on my back and chest a bit, but I did not notice it help clear up my face.
44	50	It's never helped with my acne nor my period pain and it's made me EXTREMELY irritable and very very moody and depressed.
44	51	I've always had acne prone skin, but on this pill, I get large under the skin bumps and clogged pores all over my chin - which is an area I NEVER experienced problems with (and how I pinpointed it to the pill).
44	52	Although I don't experience other side effects, the acne never goes away and seems to be getting worse - not worth it.
44	53	I never had acne like this.
44	54	Increased oil production and scary amount of acne every morning I wake up.
44	55	I have only been on Falmina for about 2 months but I'm switching soon due to the ridiculous amount of cystic acne it has caused.
44	56	I'm prone to acne anyway, but this put it through the roof.
44	57	I never got chin or cheek acne until this product.
44	58	Most of the problems I've heard about this birth control have to do with skin so if you're not acne prone then I would recommend it.
44	59	For me Camrese has not caused any weight gain whereas other extended cycle brands did cause weight gain, acne, and constant/heavy break through bleeding.
44	60	I have nothing but great results from these pills, I was put on Amethia when I was 15 for very heavy and extremely painful periods so bad I would live on a heating pad for a week and miss school/work a few days each month) I've been taking it for 8 years now and have not had any noticeable side effects, no spotting, moodiness, weight gain or acne.
44	61	Also, I have no acne!
44	62	I went on birth control specifically for my acne and my irregular periods.
44	63	This birth control did the exact opposite of helping my acne.
44	64	I absolutely do not recommend this birth control for the use of acne.
44	65	During the first 3 month pack, I gained 7 pounds, had breast tenderness, nausea, headaches everyday, acne, spotting and a never resting appetite.
44	66	But the acne is still here and absolutely horrible!
44	67	I've never had acne before I started using this birth control and now it's all over my face and not going away with anything!
44	68	It made me extremely moody, I had horrible acne, it didn't help relieve pain for my periods at all and lost my appetite altogether because it always felt like it was stuck in my throat.
44	69	I'm happy that my acne slowly fading, my cramps is not severe than the last one I had and don't have problem at all.
44	70	I don't have acne issues, my cycles are the same painful and heavy.
44	71	It also gave me chin acne, which I never have.
44	72	I did have side affect of acne but I changed my face wash and it cleared right up.
44	73	My acne has stayed fairly clear though and cramps and pain are still managed better than they were with one-month BC pills.
44	74	My ONLY problem with this pill is that it gives me acne in waves.
44	75	I'll go a month with very little acne, then for a few months have lots of breakouts, some of them painful.
44	76	I never had any acne prior to taking the pill, but now I do..
44	77	It has also cleared up all my acne and my periods only last about 3 days.
44	78	For someone who had relatively clear skin I got the worst acne from using it!
44	79	Tried every possible skin care line and couldn't understand how I went from clear skin to a face full of acne... and now some acne scars too.
44	80	After several tests I am confirmed to have Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) which basically gave me major cystic acne, mild increase in body hair, and irregular periods (occurring 2-4 times a year).
44	81	I also have severe back acne which I have had for the last 6 years.
44	82	This birth control hasn't helped with my acne at all, but I don't think it's necessarily worse which is a good thing.
44	83	Then the acne started.
44	84	Turns out this pill which is often persrcibed to TREAT acne, is one of the worst BC that causes acne.
44	85	I have had some extra acne too.
44	86	I've also been experiencing horrific cramps, acne, back pain, and moodiness.
44	87	I had moderate acne before birth control, and it was nearly non-existant with Sprintec.
44	88	As far as acne, my skin has always been clear and I have not noted any changes.
44	89	I use Alesse for my acne, I didn't have that bad acne but I started 3 months ago and my acne got worse since then and won't totally clear up.
44	90	Some days my face is not that bad and sometimes it's bad and it bothers me since before taking this pill my acne was controllable.
44	91	I think this product is not that helpful for acne, well that's just for me but I don't know about others, everyone is different and has different skin.
44	92	I've been on Alesse for three months now, and although I haven't suffered any weight loss/gain, acne or nausea I have felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.
44	93	(I'm 21 years old) I had perfect skin my entire life (even through puberty) and after I commenced the pill the acne hit me like a ton of bricks.
44	94	All forms of acne are on my face, and I've been using dermatologist products and services and they said it's a hormonal issue as to why the acne has gotten so horrible.
44	95	So when people say birth control doesn't cause acne they are WRONG, cause this birth control DOES CAUSE ACNE.
44	96	Not only did I get acne, I gained 15 pounds, breasts got larger (only plus side), severe nausea the week before my period, and began suffering depression.
44	97	This pill has given me so much acne.
44	98	My mood and emotions are pretty stable but my acne is unbearable.
44	99	I was on Marlissa for over 6 months and loved it - my periods were regulated, no weight gain, no acne, boobs grew.
44	100	It cause my acne to get far worse and scar like I've never had before.Not only this but my anxiety levels went through the roof, my depression did the same causing me suicidial thoughts and I hadABSOLUTELY no energy.
44	101	", I had acne breakouts, which I have not had since the age of 15, so 12 years later & not sexy out breaks.
44	102	I never had chest or back acne, now I'm covered.
44	103	During that time I had the worst acne of my life and was nauseated every day, and I had migraine headaches with vomiting at work which ceased when I quit taking the pill.
44	104	I have been on Alesse for 5 months now, and at the beginning it seemed to work effectively - regulating my periods, preventing pregnancy, as well as partially helping my acne.
44	105	Alesse is NOT an appropriate birth control choice to help with hormonal acne.
44	106	One of the main causes of hormonal acne is a rise is androgens (male hormones) which you do NOT need more of if you are experiencing hormonal acne (jawline, chin, cystic).
44	107	I am sure this is a great birth control option for some but keep in mind that it is probably not your best bet if your main focus is to decrease your acne.
44	108	I had bad hormonal acne before starting this pill (I was not on any birth control prior to taking Amethia) but now I rarely break out except for a few stress related pimples in the past couple of weeks.
44	109	I took Alesse as a birth control as well as to stop my acne.
44	110	I used to get bad acne before my period and it recently started because before I didn't used to get acne.
44	111	I'm 19 btw and just before the beginning of the school year I started getting this and the doctors suggested bc because it could be hormones and my acne wasnt that bad just a few on my forehead and cheeks but after I started taking Alesse it got really bad and I have super bad hyperpigmentation now that I didn't have before.
44	112	I took it for about 5 months and stopped and now my acne is gone but the hyperpigmentation remains
44	113	Got lots of headaches, acne got worse (cystic acne on my chin back and chest), and lower sex drive.
44	114	But once I got about 2 months into using  this birth control I noticed a cycle with my face, terrible acne, itchy bumps and one of my eyes very red and swelled.
44	115	I had very nice skin before this birth control , but the whole time using alesse my skin was FILLED with acne.
44	116	Haven't been feeling nauseous, no acne, or appetite changes.
44	117	I'm also starting to have acne.
44	118	I'm 43 years old, haven't had acne since I was 13 years old!
44	119	I've had no side effects, but I do have change in emotions really quick but other then that it's all good actually increase my sex drive... haven't gotten pregnant to weight gain and no acne just really emotional
44	120	I also initially had a massive acne flare up when I started Camrese.
44	121	I have not gained weight or had mood swings or acne which is great, but It's like now I have chronic fatigue... Coffee only fixes it so much, but everything else is great.
44	122	Super short periods, no acne, no cramping.
44	123	I have not experienced any weight gain, headaches, increased cramps, nor acne in the 2 years I have been on Altavera.
44	124	I'm 18 and I just started birth control for the first time to help with acne and my doctor prescribed Levora.
44	125	#1 it gave me acne.
44	126	Since taking Portia, my acne has gotten so much better, in the first 3 months I lost 20 lbs, there has been no negative effect for me.
44	127	Cramps everyday, breakthrough bleeding, acne, sore breasts, frequent urination, back pain, nausea, bloating, anxiety and depression.
44	128	Horrible side effects, gave me acne, a lot of bloating, nauseous, migraine and water retention.
44	129	I haven't gotten pregnant and my acne has gone away.
44	130	This birth control has worsen my acne, caused me severe head aches, worsen my abdominal pain thru out and off my period, heavy bloating, worsen my constipation, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and rather 5 days my periods are 7-9.
44	131	This pill doesn't help with acne at all...it has actually caused me to have extremely severe acne.
44	132	I have had tremendous weight gain and more acne.
44	133	I had never struggled with bad acne before but I began getting cysts around my jawline and breakout on my cheeks (which I never got before).
44	134	While Aviane significantly decreased my hormonal acne, I experienced slight moodiness and a complete lack of sex drive.
44	135	But my sex drive is more important to me than my acne, so I've gone off the pill completely and will look for a non-hormonal way to clear my face up.
44	136	Occasional acne breakouts but nothing too bad.
44	137	What little acne I had before has cleared up and I have also noticed a change in the size of my boobs but no weight gain or weight loss.
44	138	I've always had clear skin so acne wasn't a problem at all.
44	139	PROS: super light periods that only last about 5 days (sometimes so light I can't even put a tampon in), no weight gain, no acne, no pregnancies lol.
44	140	After researching about pills, i figured as long as i didnt get acne breakouts, gain weight or get hairy, it was perfect.
44	141	I was completely depressed, anxious and stressed the entire time, my libido was almost non-existent and i started to get cyctic acne on my face... you can imagine how all of this would affect newlyweds!!
44	142	I have no pain, no mood issues, my body weight has stayed relitivly average, and my acne is clearing up nicely!
44	143	I've gained ten pounds, constantly bloated (which adds another ten pounds basically), horrible acne, chest acne that has left permanent scars (having to put makeup on my chest now to wear anything that's not a turtleneck!!!!
44	144	I use retin a for acne so my skin has been unaffected.
44	145	A little about me so you can judge how relevant my review is: 20, 5'6", 120lbs, never had regular periods before (2.5 weeks apart, other times 6 months apart), history of horrible acne, needed to take accutane for a year.
44	146	My acne on my face has gotten worse.
44	147	my acne is non-existent, my breast are larger which is a plus for me, and I've lost weight in all the right places!
44	148	I don't have severe acne but it didn't clear up my pimples.
44	149	It successfully treated my cramping, mood swings, and acne.
44	150	Since I had gone through puberty at 11,and had acne since then and now my skin is like a baby again.
44	151	I was taking Nortrel, which caused me to get cystic pimples and hormonal acne(not terrible but enough to bother me) as well as break through bleeding.
44	152	My biggest issues with birth controls are hormonal acne and breakthrough bleeding.
44	153	For the first 6 months of taking the pill I had no problems at all, I felt normal except I did get acne which went away after about 1-3 months.
44	154	I have had horrible acne since taking this birth control.
44	155	All over my body acne.
44	156	This has worked amazingly for my hormonal acne (cystic acne on the sides of my chin).
44	157	Most effective treatment I have ever used for acne.
44	158	I've never been prone to acne, but lately I've been having bumps and things pop up on my face - nothing too major though in my opinion.
44	159	No cramping, no acne, no weight gain.
44	160	I've been on Depo and Mirena both of which I do not recommend but Lessina no acne, nothing.
44	161	My appetite has increased & I have a little acne here and there.
44	162	I more easily get acne and whenever I scratch myself the marks show.
44	163	Other then that I have less acne and lighter periods.
44	164	I didn't get any unusual acne, or weight gain.
44	165	No period, my acne and mood swings were under control.
44	166	My acne cleared up a lot!
44	167	I've been on Alesse for about 3 months and my acne is terrible and I feel depressed often.
44	168	It did not help with PMS or acne but I had no weight gain.
44	169	Only con to Alesse that both my friend and I agree on is the facial acne.
44	170	I have been on Jolessa for about a month due to having excessive cramps and bleeding so I was excited to try not having a period for three months, but so far everything is fine no bad side effects except a little acne.
44	171	I don't have acne except an occasional zit or two, my weight for the nine years has been the same beside small weight gain.
44	172	THE PROS: no weight gain, no facial acne, no weird side effects like unwanted hair growth, no pregnancies and a period that is fairly short, light and always on time.
44	173	It actually cleared up acne on my chin so I have a clear face now that the dermatologist couldn't even clear up because chin acne is usually all hormonal.
44	174	It also helped with my acne!
44	175	My acne has cleared!
44	176	It controlled my acne as well.
44	177	I never experienced any bad breakouts of acne, though I still have my occasional mood swing.
44	178	I haven't had aching breasts or acne yet.
44	179	At first, due to the sudden change of hormones, I had a horrible breakout of acne on my face, and I was very emotional and bitter at first.
44	180	Almost immediately I began suffering from abdominal cramps, spotting unpredictably, and increased acne on my back, shoulders and jawline.
44	181	It's been nearly a year later and although the spotting and cramping has subsided, the acne is still there (I can't even wear a top without a hood, let alone a tank top or bathing suit!)
44	182	I haven't had any acne problems or weight gain.
44	183	I only had issues with acne and a few headaches.
44	184	I would still use them but at 31 acne is not a good look for me.
44	185	But I have been getting some acne which is actually very inconvenient being that I'm going away in 2 days.
44	186	Other than that it's pretty okay just the acne is a complete blow.
44	187	As far as acne and weight gain I haven't noticed much of a difference.
44	188	I've also had mood swings and BAD acne.
44	189	I had spotting the first week, acne worsened and my moods were absolutely uncontrollable.
44	190	Within the two and a half months I've been on it, I have gained about 5 pounds, have the worst acne I've ever experienced, and cry over NOTHING.
44	191	I have noticed some acne but nothing to worry about really.
44	192	No acne, no depression, and no real weight gain.
44	193	This pill by far cleared up my acne!
44	194	No acne, and I have not had any weight gain.
44	195	In the first couple of months I started Portia, I had crazy cystic acne, and not because of Portia, but this pill cleared my face to where my acne was non existent.
44	196	I have always suffered with acne and I have never felt better about myself.
44	197	Well now that I have been on this pill for a year, in the past month my cystic acne has come back FULL force.
44	198	I also am getting acne on my shoulders and sometimes my face, but I wash it multiple times a day because it is so oily!
44	199	(I have never had acne before).
44	200	During the third pack the break through bleeding continued, as did the acne (now spread to my back and chest), also I started having headaches on a daily basis.
44	201	Although I have not experienced any weight gain, acne, or emotional changes, this pill has made me spot like CRAZY.
44	202	I was put on Portia after I had my baby but I we also put on postpartum depression pills, all of a sudden I started getting very bad mood swings and I thought it was my post partum depression pills so I switched it, but I still get bad mood swings, now I think I got to switch birth control pills but it did regulate my periods and didn't give my acne but I hate having mood swings.
44	203	None of these helped my acne and a few had horrible breakthrough bleeding.
44	204	My periods were always regular and I had very mild teenage acne beforehand, but after taking this for 3 months I had the most AWFUL cystic acne on my chin and forehead.
44	205	I have had ALOT of spotting happening, I get cramps (of which was something I was trying to NOT get) which still causes me to take my pain medication, I also have had the worst acne I have ever had in my whole life.
44	206	Helps with acne too.
44	207	I was taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen for acne and thought that this would keep my acne at bay.
44	208	Everything was fine the first 6 months and than all of a sudden I got really bad acne.
44	209	After a while it did make me gain 5-10 lbs and I had acne towards the end of the year.
44	210	I hate that I had to leave Jolessa behind but I can't stand the acne or the weight, even if it was moderate.
44	211	I have noticed some change in my skin being dry and having some acne problems, which I've never had before.
44	212	I have had no extra weight gain (I'm a steady 120), I have had no acne break outs, I haven't spotted and my periods are light.
44	213	If you're looking for all that as well as an acne treatment, BEWARE (especially if you have adult acne)!
44	214	My doctor put me on Alesse because I was looking for a birth control and an acne treatment (I had moderate adult acne on my cheeks).
44	215	Then approaching my period on the fourth month, I woke up with 6 acne cysts on my chin, jaw and lower cheek.
44	216	While I have not had any migraines, I have been bleeding for 3 weeks straight, have a horrible outbreak of acne and very bad nausea since starting this medication two months ago.
44	217	The acne is big red bumps which sucks.
44	218	Since I've started taking it I've experienced many negative side effects such as cramping, gaining 10 lbs, intense mood swings where I will cry for no reason, get angry extremely easily, and a significant increase in acne.
44	219	I also think this causes me to have some acne that seems to have started about the time I began taking it.
44	220	Within in the first month, I experienced some pain in my uterus (which only lasted a couple days, no big deal), flared up acne, moodiness, increased appetite, decreased sex drive, and dryness.
44	221	I Also have mild acne increase, along with some abnormal emotional sensitivity.
44	222	After about a week on this birth control I started to get awful acne and had to stop taking it after two weeks.
44	223	It is my 3rd month taking it and I'm still breaking out.
44	224	I began breaking out like crazy within a week of starting this.
44	225	Soon after I began to notice my skin was breaking out.
44	226	I am breaking out and I feel like I am always hungry even after I eat and have gained a few pounds.
44	227	My face is breaking out and extremely dry, and I've been having bleeding on and off for up to 7 days consecutively.
44	228	My skin was always breaking out and it was only worse in the summer.
44	229	My skin has been breaking out with little pimples that are coverable but I can feel them and have never been there before.
44	230	The rest of my side effects include my breasts being sore the week before my period, discharge, I both lose and gain weight it depends on what kind if day it wants to give me, I've been getting more black heads and a couple more pimples than usual.
44	231	Now I have pimples every day, and if one heals I'll get 2-3 more, by the time it's healed.
44	232	But when it came to be the week before my period I noticed I was getting pimples by the daily.
44	233	I literally have over 30 pimples on my face that are huge, red, cystic, and definitely 100% because of this pill.
44	234	They aren't even pimples just huge bumps and you can't do anything about.
44	235	However, immediately, I got CANKER sores (I never get these) and pimples (when my complexion is generally clear).
44	236	I never had any issues with pimples ever in my life, but when I take the white pills for the period or forget to take a few pills, I break out SO bad.
44	237	I started to get red bumps like hives on my stomach and then when 4 cyst like pimples started on my  face simultaneously, I knew this was not going to work for me.
44	238	I just switched/started taking Portia 3 days ago, and the sweat pimples on my shoulders have gone away, and the two new cystic pimples I had coming in are gone, and my face is looking pretty clear.
44	239	Within a week, I got 3 cystic pimples !
44	240	I've gained 10lbs, experience pimples here and there, mood swings, and a decrease in sex drive!
44	241	These aren't just little pimples you pop and have no worries but they're sore pimples that give headaches.
44	242	I don't normally have pimples so this is a lot for me.
44	243	I have the biggest, reddest and most painful pimples I have ever had in my life.
44	244	My skin had cleared up but now when I get pimples they scar.
44	245	I have experienced an increase in my eating, I have been getting dizzy for a few minutes, and a rash of whitish pimples on my chest and on my forearm that I have never had before.
44	246	I have noticed my skin has cleared up a bit more, there are those occasional zits here and there but thats normal.
44	247	Like little bumps all over my forehead and painful zits on my jawline and cheeks.
44	248	My skin is now 10x more oily and i have painful zits on my cheeks, chin and lips.
44	249	I probably get at least few zits per week with Kurvelo, but it's tolerable because I don't get any of the other side effects that Sprintec gave me.
44	250	I started getting zits on my chest and back - something that hasn't happened to me since freshman year of high school!
44	251	I got Falmina to help with my periods as I used to have awful cramps and mood swings that could murder you with a glance, I've been taking this for about 3 months now, the results are: My cramps no longer happen!
44	252	I started this birth control because I had bad period cramps that would prevent me from going to school.
44	253	I had issues with horrible cramps that were making me throw up, and now those cramps have gone down to an uncomfortable feeling and nothing too painful at all.
44	254	I've been getting sharp cramps, and am now bleeding (even after my period has stopped) and, huge migraines on the right side only of my head (whether or not this is a side effect, I don't know but it has occurred ever since I started taking Alesse).
44	255	I don't know if I should be alarmed about the sharp cramps, as they are extremely painful, but do go away, and come back within seconds.
44	256	I got on birth control for my horrible cramps and to prevent getting pregnant.
44	257	It does help majorly with my cramps and how much I was bleeding
44	258	My appetite stayed the same, I didn't experience any nausea, headaches cramps or anything like that.
44	259	I switched from Trinessa to Ashlyna because of my horrible cramps, very heavy bleeding, and broken out skin.
44	260	My periods are MUCH better-- I still get cramps, but it is 90% better than it used to be.
44	261	I'm always naueseous when I do eat and my cramps feel just the same as before.
44	262	I was sick to my stomach for the first couple days of a new pack every month, my cramps got worse instead of better, my mood would constantly change, and there would be random months where my face would totally break out.
44	263	I get cramps and pain randomly throughout the whole month.
44	264	Lastly the mood swings and period cramps which were terrible.
44	265	It was wonderful actually I never had problems getting my period on time, it always works and my cramps weren't bothering me.
44	266	I moved and my pharmacy gave me Levora- same amount of active hormones but, Levora gave me god awful cramps all times of the month, made me miss my period for a month at a time, get 2 periods a month and sometimes just get it in the middle of the cycle.
44	267	I have had horrible, horrible cramps, like, on-the-floor-screaming cramps (which is why I started taking these pills), but at least those only lasted an hour at a time tops!
44	268	I'm worried about missing school, and I can at least try to manage my cramps like I have before.
44	269	Even though Portia kept me from getting pregnant, I woke up every morning with cramps, nausea and by week 3 I had purpura show up on my legs.
44	270	My flow used to be heavy and 7-10 days with EXTREME cramps!
44	271	I am now down to 2-3 days with a light flow and manageable cramps.
44	272	My period cramps became way more manageable and my periods only ever lasted about 4 days max.
44	273	I am on the 3rd sheet of pills so about 3 months in... before taking i weighed 120 now I am 130... feel depressed, just this week started to get brown discharge and thick red blood clots, try to take the pill everyday with my coffee but I was an hour off a few times, my boobs grew from C to double DD I don't mind but I do feel bloated and have had a couple angry depressed days..not sure its worth these symptoms but before I had such bad cramps n migraines was in bed every month for 2 days at least.
44	274	The abdominal cramping I get is severe, even worse then the cramps I got PMS-ing every month before I took this medication.
44	275	I feel nauseous a lot of the time, cramps periodically, increased anxiety, no appetite, fatigue and get dizzy at times.
44	276	My period is also now 3 days instead of 7 and I have basically no cramps.
44	277	The reason I started taking the pill was because of my extremely painful cramps and it did its job of taking them away which I am grateful for.
44	278	I have some cramps during my period.
44	279	I noticed that cramps are a little worse when I do have my period, probably because I don't have my menstrual cycle as much.
44	280	No nausea, no cramps, etc.
44	281	The cramps during the breakthrough bleeding were worse than the cramps during the withdrawal bleed!
44	282	My doctor switched me to this after having depression, anxiety and terrible cramps while taking Kariva.
44	283	I'm 19, and I started taking this pill because I was sick of passing out from painful cramps and I had started having sex with my boyfriend like 8 months before and I was always afraid I'd get pregnant.
44	284	I've had no bleeding, very mild cramps nothing that I can't handle.
44	285	Most of the time I pass out at least 1 time during my cycle, due to cramps so the cramps I've experienced while taking this haven't been nearly as bad as the ones I've experienced so over all super excited about that.
44	286	Not only that my cramps are way worse too .
44	287	I did have period cramps after 2 months which should have  been my period timing.
44	288	So far, 100% pregnancy protection :) Because I only have a period 3-4 times a year, my life is so much easier... No more missing work, debilitating cramps, or scheduling around periods for travel days and beach fun.
44	289	But once my period came, my cramps got so much worse than what they normally are like.
44	290	So I'm this person that hates birth control as in hate them to the core but since we have one child and wanted to wait to have another and the Latex on the condom was getting me sick all the time I decided to look into bc my doc suggested jolesa because I have painful cramps.
44	291	I was put on this because of over heating, severe cramps, heavy bleeding and shaking from my periods.
44	292	However, due to major cramps my Dr. suggested this method to regulate and easy my period pain.
44	293	No major cramps or heavy bleeding, but I have been using panty liners for the entire time.
44	294	The first 3 months I was bleeding heavily and had very painful cramps (also, I had a cyst on my ovary that had ruptured).
44	295	However, this did make my period very consistent, extremely light, and barely any cramps
44	296	I got pretty bad mood swings/anxiety with this but worst of all, I got cramps.
44	297	I had cramps all month long for about 3 months before I switched.
44	298	I am now having my period, and it is just like how they were before the medicine, only with more cramps.
44	299	I usually have awful cramps the first day, then they go away.
44	300	I'm 3 days in and the cramps haven't gotten better.
44	301	Well worth the 9 mo wait bc now only 4 periods per year that last 3 days with light bleeding and zero cramps.
44	302	I started taking Ashlyna for bad cramps.
44	303	This is a heavy one with horrendous cramps.
44	304	My first bc, Tri Linyah, depressed me to no extent, gave me mega cramps, heavy periods and made me feel sick everyday.
44	305	I have endometriosis and was put on Camrese so I could have less periods and hopefully lessen the severity of cramps and pain.
44	306	However, it has made my breasts swell, and my cramps slightly worse during my cycle.
44	307	No depression with this pill, just a few weeks of heavy PMS-like symptoms (cramps, exhaustion, moodiness) at first, then it stabilized.
44	308	The positives though are that I have had zero cramps which is huge considering I used to have horrible ones.
44	309	The pill also causes me really bad cramps & my period was off.
44	310	Which has been great because I used to have horrid cramps.
44	311	The worst was when I got my period.. it started off not normal than what it usually is for me and it was the worst cramps I have EVER experienced!
44	312	I've been on this pill for less than a month and it's been awful - I wanted to see if it would help lessen the duration and heaviness of my period but I'm terrified that it's going to make it worse - my ance has been out of control this past month on my other pill I would get the occasional pimple around the start of my period but this is just ridiculous I've been experiencing cramps and digestive problems all month and didn't think it would be the pill but I'm switching back to yaz this stuff sucks
44	313	Periods last 5 days but are extremely light, and I rarely get cramps.
44	314	I switched because I was told  it helped better with cramps an lighten your period, but omg I been spotting every since I been on it!
44	315	It was prescribed by my doctor to help with the extreme cramps and various symptoms I get during my period in spite of me being a smoker.
44	316	My period was hell aswell I got bad cramps for a week before and all during, this is not normal for me.
44	317	When I did get my period Jeezus, heavy flow, fatigue, fever like feeling/hard time getting out of bed and functioning, and cramps worse than without being on this med.
44	318	I used to be incapacitated during my period due to cramps and id never remember when the blood would start.
44	319	This almost eliminated my cramps, lightened the flow and shortened my period.
44	320	Only thing is that I gained around 5 lbs, and it didn't help with cramps or lightening my period which is one of the reasons I went on it in the first place.
44	321	I used to have extremely heavy periods with horrendous cramps and since going on this my periods are much lighter, shorter & typically no cramps at all.
44	322	I constantly have cramps (as if I'm starting my period) and nauseous every other day.
44	323	Huge clots, massive cramps, totally gross, and a continuous headache.
44	324	Started taking this pill due to the severe cramps I suffer when I do have my period.
44	325	Started the pill Sunday following the start of my period and I m bleeding heavy again with cramps.
44	326	My periods have gotten much lighter; most days I don't even need a tampon, but I get bad cramps on 1 or 2 of the days, which I never used to get before BC.
44	327	Mostly used to help treat PMS, cramps and headache.
44	328	Lately been having horrible cramps about a week before, and some mild spotting.
44	329	Did not have my hormone headache and cramps were tolerable with one month bc.
44	330	I began bleeding and having moderate cramps again three days ago.
44	331	Short and light periods and no cramps!
44	332	my period cramps were unbearable to the point of not being able to walk and my mood swings became uncontrollable.
44	333	However, I didn't get cramps much before I started the pill and now I get them and they are horrible.
44	334	Before my cramps were pretty bad and I had heavy bleeding for about 3/5 days of my period but I took Aleve and it made it bare-able.
44	335	I've only taken this pill for about a week and I can already tell it is not helping with my cramps or bleeding in the slightest.
44	336	It made my flow lighter but the cramps and the back pains were worst then when I was not on the pill.
44	337	My period was bad enough for 5 days imagine having it for longer with horrible back pains and cramps.
44	338	Since taking this i feel like my guts are going to fall out, The first few days i started having weird cramps in my upper stomach which felt like contractions when you are going to give birth than when that went away i would get normal cramping which i dont really care about but every other day my bleeding is different.
44	339	I've been on it for over a year & it does work against pregnancy but gives me overwhelming nausea every single day & doesn't go away it also fixed my period but gave me cramps
44	340	My gyno prescribed this pill to help with my menstrual cramps.
44	341	Wish me luck, the cramps & bleeding are worse now than before.
44	342	The reason I began taking it is I used to have unbearable cramps every month that would keep me in bed.
44	343	My periods were short and light & minor cramps
44	344	No cramps.
44	345	The reason why I switched birth controls was because my last one (the depo shot) was giving me extremely bad head aches and cramps.
44	346	Only complaint is the intense cramps around the time of my period.
44	347	My period last 6 days with normal bleeding and painful cramps.
44	348	The cramps are bad but not strong enough to stop taking them especially because they only occur every 3 months.
44	349	I have a very light 3-4 day period every time, no breakthrough bleeding, no cramps headaches or anything else!
44	350	I was so exhausted and had ongoing cramps for days and days.
44	351	This week again I called the Dr back because the bleeding seems to be getting worst and the cramps are on a level of 20 he said again just keep taking them and as the new month is approaching a change can occur if not contact him again.
44	352	I have had on and off bleeding and major cramps.
44	353	Everything about it is wonderful, except the cramps I get right before my period are so intense.
44	354	I also have been getting painful stomach cramps every morning, but they don't last more that a few minutes.
44	355	I'm currently on the end of pack 3 and I'm getting off of this pill because I've experienced bloating, stomach cramps and really really bad GAS!
44	356	My first period was extremely heavy but no cramps.
44	357	I've been very irritable and had cramps and headaches during these few days.
44	358	Seasonale is awesome especially if you have very heavy periods and very bad cramps during menstrual cycle.
44	359	The third and 4th month was  when the side effects all hit me at once; bloating, weight gain, slight headaches and uncomfortable cramps.
44	360	Been on it for 4 weeks, started of with the meanest night sweats like somebody threw a bucket of water on me, my appetite is more controlled meaning I get full fast, and when I first started I had the worst fatigue ever but everything is fine now just dull cramps every here and there.
44	361	My periods before I was on it were very painful because of severe cramps.
44	362	Also I would get bad cramps and back aches which appeared after 6 months.
44	363	The early periods, cramps, and backaches were doable but i decided to switch off it to loestrin 1.5/30.
44	364	I chose to go on birth control because I used to get really bad cramps and have heavy bleeding.
44	365	I had horrible cramps and pretty much nonstop bleeding.
44	366	Now my periods are predictable and the cramps aren't as bad.
44	367	I mainly took this due to my bad cramps and heavy period.
44	368	I hate the spotting and cramps but my breast did grow and the 1st few months on it was great.
44	369	I've always had a super heavy 7 day period and terrible cramps.
44	370	The cramps have reduced a lot but my period last month was 14 DAYS LONG.
44	371	I was always regular, but have always had bad cramps.
44	372	The cramps start over heavy then get lighter, it's really off and on but my for my period right now, it's a bit lighter then before but I haven't seen a big difference yet?
44	373	Gave me severe anxiety, nausea, stomach cramps, every side effect listed I got.
44	374	I've been on probably at least 20 different forms of birth control for one reason or another, usually due to painful cramps and heavy flow.
44	375	I get severely depressed for one day, the day I go off of them to get my period, and my cramps are not as bad as they usually were.
44	376	At first it made me feel like I Wanted to be more intimate with my significant other, but after a few years of taking it I now have bad leg cramps, a very extremely low desire to Have any kind of sexual engagement with my partner and I gained about 20 pounds since I've been on it.
44	377	It is effective in reducing cramps and lightening my period, but I am overly emotional all of the time.
44	378	I also tried Triceclyn Lo for about 6 months, but my doctor switched me to Alesse after I complained of stomach cramps and constant bloating, which Alesse seemed to fix.
44	379	THE CONS: Acne on my back, mood swings and depression, low sex drive, and quite painful menstrual cramps.
44	380	It cleared my skin pretty well but after a while it stopped but I never broke out crazily my breasts grew a little and I still PMS and get minor cramps but my period is still heavy but shorter by 4 days so I'm not going to complain!
44	381	The best thing I would say is that I don't get cramps anymore.
44	382	I have not got pregnant, and my cycles are much lighter, less cramps and shorter.
44	383	(Not to mention the breast soreness, leg cramps, and depression).
44	384	The first three months were horrible, I had mood swings where I would start crying randomly, most of the time because I would take it at 7 pm and around 9 pm would begin feeling sharp cramps in my stomach that were unbearable, it was so hard to continue taking them at work knowing I would be in pain from them.
44	385	Before the pill I had terrible cramps on my period but since Alesse my cramps are much milder.
44	386	I was on Ortho and Emoq before this and it was awful horrible periods that never seemed to stop, I'm on my fourth month of this and no mood swings, no weight gain, no cramps, no random spotting/periods and when I do get my period, it's the lightest period I've ever had.
44	387	My breasts are starting to hurt and I've had bad menstrual cramps today!
44	388	My period was horrible last month horrible cramps I couldn't get out of bed!
44	389	So right away my period got lighter with tolerable and few cramps, as opposed to my normal constant excruciatingly painful cramps that would sentence me to a day or two on the couch with a hot water bottle and some Aleve.
44	390	It has done wonders for my period, no cramps or bloating, period is so much lighter and manageable.
44	391	I've been spotting for months now and have had frequent nausea and cramps.
44	392	I don't have any crazy cramps or horrific mood swings.
44	393	It also made my periods lighter and with hardly any cramps.
44	394	I first got on Jolessa because the menstrual cramps I suffered each period were HORRIBLE.
44	395	I haven't had any cramps or spotting since starting the pill, other than the obvious period related ones when that time finally does roll around.
44	396	The horrible cramps ended, and my 6 day period was reduced to 3 or 4 days.
44	397	Previously I had cramps, no cramps now.
44	398	I experience mood swings, break outs, and cramps during the first two weeks.
44	399	On another note, I have always suffered with heavy periods and terrible cramps to the point of wanting to throw up from the pain.
44	400	Now my periods are SUPER light and I have little to no cramps.
44	401	I started LoSeasonique and haven't experienced any migraines or cramps since.
44	402	I'm going on week 3 of bleeding and maintaining worse cramps than I had before I was on the pill.
44	403	Plus I have the worst cramps of my life.
44	404	I had very bad cramps before I started birth control, but Portia helped a lot.
44	405	I just now got to my actual period and wow the cramps are unbelievable.
44	406	I used to never have cramps but now my cramps have been so terrible that I can't sleep, but maybe since this is my first period while on the pill.
44	407	After my body gets used to it maybe I wont have such severe cramps.
44	408	I get awful cramps and headaches during my period.
44	409	My gynecologist suggested I take birth control because I'm a wreck when I get my period--terrible cramps that nothing helps, loss of appetite, extreme fatigue.
44	410	Hopefully I'll have a lighter period (my period lasts 5-7 days) when I finish the pack and no cramps, fatigue, or headaches.
44	411	I've been on the pill for almost a month, no break through bleeding, but light cramps and headaches but not severe.
44	412	I guess I can say that's good compared to some others comments but I'm getting off the pill today because I just got on it because I wanted fewer periods but I absolutely hate cramps and headaches.
44	413	I have had no bleeding, no cramps since I have been on it.
44	414	I used to have very heavy bleeding and terrible cramps.
44	415	When my OBGYN switched my birth control pill to LoSeasonique in an attempt to relieve my severe cramps and menstrual migraines I was hopeful.
44	416	I am so glad I did, no spotting, no cramps, some weight gain but it comes off, and my breasts have grown a little.
44	417	I have always had terrible cramps, on the verge of endometriosis, and this is the first birth control of several I've been on that has actually reduced the cramps - and quite significantly.
44	418	I was on the name brand version of Jolessa, Seasonique, for 6 months and when I would get my period, I would have terrible cramps...even when I wouldn't get bad cramps before being on birth control.
44	419	I do have to say, before I was on the pill I had no cramps and I have gotten some after starting the pill, but only on the first day.
44	420	Have been on Lybrel for 1 year now and get periods, breakthrough bleeding, spotting and cramps.
44	421	On the plus side, I didn't even know the period was coming like I usually do: no severe cramps, mood swings, PMS, etc... On the down side, I have zero sex drive.
44	422	I had heavy periods, by the time I turned 20 my cramps were so bad that I had to rest a day and apply a heat pack.
44	423	And my period did have some pretty good cramps but only lasted three days.
44	424	I used to get horrible cramps that got worse as I aged.
44	425	My cramps were so bad that I would have to miss work.
44	426	Since I've been on Lybrel, I've had very little spotting and no monthly cramps.
44	427	And the menstrual cycle before last had extremely painful cramps.
44	428	It has significantly reduced menstrual cramps, so ibuprofen is only needed occasionally.
44	429	Light cramps occur a day or two before my period, followed by light to moderate cramps on the first day.
44	430	I was having terrible cramps and after taking trivora they were much better.
44	431	I did cramp a little the first two days, but nothing ibuprofen can't fix.
44	432	It's like one intense cramp that won't let go for 30 minutes or so and typically leaves me in tears.
44	433	And my period lasted only 4 days cramp free along with slight bloating which is great compared to lasting 7 days.
44	434	At first I was happy with this pill because those previous s/e went away almost instantly but for the past 3 days on the placebo I've had the worst cramping and heaviest period I've ever had.
44	435	After alesse my skin is really bad and I get the worse cramping and back pain right before and for the first 3 days of period.
44	436	Period weeks were short & sweet, but a downside was every couple months I would randomly get heavy cramping in the middle of the night.
44	437	My periods were a bit lighter and the cramping had improved significantly.
44	438	No nausea, no cramping, no spotting yet.
44	439	Periods were fine, cramping a little bit but the crying was over the top for me.
44	440	I am switching because the breakthrough bleeding and cramping became ridiculous.
44	441	Aside from increased hunger, I've noticed I've had less cramping and my periods were lighter and for less days.
44	442	I have only been on this for about 2 weeks and everyday at the same time I have stomach cramping.
44	443	With lots of cramping.
44	444	I love Lessina no weight gain, no bloating, and minimal cramping during period.
44	445	Before Seasonale, I had 8 day heavy periods and would get pretty bad cramping.
44	446	With this pill, I have a very light period once every 3 months, no cramping at all and no other symptoms.
44	447	But on the third month, I started to have brown spotting every day, and the spotting became a full blown period  with the worst cramping I had ever experienced, even though I skipped placebo week and continued the full strength pills continuously.
44	448	I have been taking quasense tablets since April 2016....mostly started because of terrible cramping from my period...it does prevent pregnancy but the side effects are horrible....I lost 30 pounds prior to starting this pills only to gain 22 pounds of it back in less than 4 months....I have absolutely no sex drive....and the stomach pains are so horrible that at 30 years of age I asked my doctor to perform a colonoscopy/endo to be sure nothing major was going on with me....I understand that everybody is not the same however....I would not recommend these pills to anyone!!!
44	449	There is still spotting, very randomly and cramping.
44	450	I've had absolutely no spotting or cramping.
44	451	My period came early and I have never experienced such extreme cramping before.
44	452	As well as constant cramping and spotting.
44	453	Abdominal cramping, nausea, crying nonstop!
44	454	I did have a lot of breast tenderness that continues and heavy cramping around my period.
44	455	very little cramping if any and usually moderate to light.
44	456	This month, my period was 1-2 days but I've been cramping like crazy and not bleeding.
44	457	Bright side, I haven't had any cramping.
44	458	I had breakthrough bleeding that lasted over 2 weeks, cramping and pms moods.
44	459	So this gas cramping occurs during random times daily.. And it's a problem!
44	460	The first one is that my cramping from my period is extreme.
44	461	At first, I was on the original Seasonique - I had to switch to the Lo Seasonique because with the original, I had the worst cramping, moodiness, bleeding, ever.
44	462	But Falmina has stopped the cramping and has made my periods very short.
44	463	I had no cramping and a lighter period.
44	464	Before being on Portia I had very bad cramping and it 100% when away when I started this pill.
44	465	With this pill I have some PMS, nothing out of the norm and barely any cramping (which is great because I suffer from bad cramping).
44	466	Then I started having anxiety attacks, feeling depressed about everything, rapid weight gain (25lbs in 2 months despite living at the gym), extreme irritability, heavy bleeding (3-4 super tampons every 2 hours) halfway through a pack, intense cramping, new and powerful migraines, and horrible skin.
44	467	I don't experience mood swings, or any major cramping on the pill either.
44	468	I never had really bad PMS or cramping, but because of Portia, my periods are incredibly light and virtually cramp-free.
44	469	Good: no pregnancies, lighter, predictable periods with no cramping whatsoever (HUGE plus), no weight gain.
44	470	It did make it lighter but after the 5th day, I had really bad cramping and spotting went to a heavier flow.
44	471	I originally started using LoSeasonique to help control my periods when I would experience extreme cramping and migraines to the point that I could not function.
44	472	It stopped for two weeks on the second month, and started again very heavily with severe abdominal pain and cramping.
44	473	I've also noticed breakouts on my face and body and get mild cramping every few months.
44	474	I also had terrible cramping and a loss of libido.
44	475	I usually have very mild cramping and have noticed the cramping has worsened these past 3 weeks.
44	476	Otherwise I have had minor cramping periodically if I miss ONE pill.
44	477	I have slightly more cramping in the day before it starts than I did with the monthly pills (but still NOTHING like the agony of no pill-cramps which were a nightmare).
44	478	Overall I love not having to deal with messy bleeding more than four times a year, and the slight increase in cramping for one day is more than worth it to me.
44	479	My periods were predictable and it decreased my cramping and bleeding.
44	480	The first month I was on the pill I was fine I had no complications, but right after I started my second pack I got my first period and it lasted 10 days and it was heavy and crampy everyday.
44	481	(usually it was only heavy and crampy the first day and usually it was only 5 days).
44	482	My periods are shorter and less crampy, I'm also no longer a hag during pms because pms doesn't exist for me anymore :)
44	483	I sometimes feel crampy in the last few days of the month, but nothing severe.
44	484	Every thing went well for the first month then half way through the pack I started spotting and this went on for a week straight until it turned into an extremely heavy period to the point where I bled through a super tampon within a few hours then it lightened up after about a week but I was still spotting and I continued to spot on and off until I got to the placebo pills which I am taking now, my period is still extremely painful I'm going to try it for another 3 months and see if the symptoms continue.
44	485	I’m on the fourth week of Vienva and have experienced nausea, headaches, mood swings, spotting and bloating!
44	486	Have had no other side effects until again recently I experienced a more intense rash on my arms, legs and lower back but was in the middle of my pack for month 3, which lasted for about 4 days and now spotting a week before my period is supposed to start.
44	487	I’ve never had a rash in my life before taking Alesse, I’ve been on BC for 2 years and the only side effect I ever had was spotting when I first started.
44	488	Never had any problems with spotting or irregular periods.
44	489	The spotting has been horrible!
44	490	Over a month straight of spotting.
44	491	My Dr. says to stay with it and it will stop...and a year later..... still spotting.
44	492	Occasional spotting but nothing compared to what others have described.
44	493	No spotting but a regular period.
44	494	I've had "spotting" for about 2.5 months (some days worse than others), and I feel as though I am overly emotional and anxious on it.
44	495	I just started the last month before I start my period, and now I'm spotting really bad and it was scaring me at first but reading everyone else's kinda made it easier... could it just be that fact that I'm on the last month or could it be something bad wrong?
44	496	No mood swings, no spotting or headaches, or depression, but then I got into my third month and was experiencing breakthrough bleeding a lot and then had several blood clots.
44	497	And I am still having spotting.
44	498	I would have my withdrawal bleed, have about 1-2 months of peace, then the spotting began and would not stop.
44	499	I'd double up for 3-4 days or however long it took to stop it then go back on 1 pill when the spotting stopped.
44	500	2 weeks later the spotting would return, rinse and repeat.
44	501	So far this pill seems quite good other then spotting which stopped once I started taking it within the same 5 minutes every day.
44	502	I recently had spotting again which my Dr advised to take 2 pills daily for 3-5 days until it stopped.
44	503	Now gave been spotting the last two weeks
44	504	sooo, I started these pill back in January and I've gained over 20 pounds and here lately I've been spotting , breast been super sore and headaches are terrible..
44	505	My first pack did come with some irregular spotting, however after my second pack the spotting disappeared, and I have a regular period every 13 weeks as expected.
44	506	I had almost constant spotting.
44	507	The most I would make it without spotting was three weeks and then I would spot with no sign of slowing down, so I'd have to skip pills to let myself have a period.
44	508	The pill was great no spotting no periods at all I mean I nothin and it never killed my sex drive like the depo, I had some bad side effects nuasea, lil headache but the worst of all was the weight gain 20lbs in 3 months I mean I workout 5 times a week eat healthy like I'm told but the scale keeps going up I can't do this anymore I'm going to try another one been told jazamin helps with weight loss so I may give that I shot but I can't stand the way I look.
44	509	I have had no problems with this contraceptive, except for the obvious when being on an antibiotic I had spotting.
44	510	I did have to be patient through the first several months for mild spotting to cease being an issue with Camrese.
44	511	As I adjusted to Camrese if mid-cycle spotting lasted for more than a day or two I would simply take a week off from the pills and allow myself to have a period before picking back up with the pills again.
44	512	I was young so I wasn't paying attention to how my body was reacting but looking back it made me hungry with a huge appetite and I had spotting for almost a month straight.
44	513	Only giving 9/10 because I do get frequent spotting when I'm not supposed to, but what do you expect from something that only makes you have your period every 3 months.
44	514	In fact, I had spotting and bleeding everyday.
44	515	Started off fine with no spotting.
44	516	I have now been spotting with no break for the past 3 weeks.
44	517	After switching to Alesse, my periods are only 4 days and I have no spotting compared to my other pill.
44	518	It's been 3 pills and I haven't started it yet, I haven't had spotting, and I have all the symptoms of a period but the blood!
44	519	Now at 7 months, I have lost all the weight I gained, I only have occasional headaches, no nausea, and no spotting.
44	520	Then I had light spotting for a few days about 1.5 weeks prior to when my period should have came - then it was followed by heavy breakthrough bleeding.
44	521	Dealt with spotting & irregular bleeding in beginning.
44	522	I also started spotting, which I never did between periods before.
44	523	My second three month pack, I did not have any spotting, and there is no weight gain with me, or mood swings that I have noticed.
44	524	I started spotting the last week of the first pack and didnt stop spotting until the week before my period week.
44	525	So far im in the third pack and no spotting.
44	526	The 1st 6 months were rough, with spotting almost every other week and a 2 week long period Weeks 8-9 but once I started the 3rd pack, symptoms resided and improved.
44	527	However, I've had spotting every single day for the past four months.
44	528	After the first month I started spotting but I stopped taking the pills to allow myself to have a period and I have not spotted ever since.
44	529	I had no spotting at all until the 3rd month.
44	530	My spotting lasted about 3 weeks until I finished my first 3 months and had my first period.
44	531	August, I was free of spotting.
44	532	I was debating even getting another pack because I hate bleeding but apparently sticking with it for a year will cause your body to start responding without the spotting.
44	533	This is the first birth control where I haven't had spotting or had an allergic reaction to!
44	534	I have not had a single period and no spotting after the first 3 months.
44	535	I had breakthrough bleeding right away and have spotting every time I shower or go to the bathroom.
44	536	However, the spotting became a huge issue.
44	537	I began spotting during the first pack, around the time I would typically get my period.
44	538	Again, I started spotting after the first month.
44	539	About 4 weeks after starting this pill I started spotting.
44	540	This did the trick and the spotting stopped.
44	541	Aside from the spotting I have no complaints from this pill.
44	542	I was on this pill for about a year and a half, and at first I would have light spotting for normally a month or so which was quite annoying, however it was light enough to tolerate.
44	543	After being on this pill for about 3 cycles, I discovered the trick to getting rid of the spotting is to take it within the hour every day.
44	544	With my last cycle taking it always within an hour, I had almost no spotting at all.
44	545	My period was due last week but i just been spotting.
44	546	I take my pill every morning on time never miss still spotting smh.
44	547	I am on the last week of the second month of this pill and I have been spotting a brown discharge( not heavy enough for a pad or tampon but annoying)  since the last week of the first month.
44	548	If the spotting doesnt' stop after my period week I'm calling my doc for a new pill.
44	549	I had excess discharge and bled every day (not enough for period but more than spotting).
44	550	I had some spotting, but it went away promptly.
44	551	I never had a lot of spotting and I never get my period every month off of birth control anyways, probably due to low vitamins and/or low weight.
44	552	Well it took me at least 7 months for that to happen bc the first few months I still got my period every single month and the spotting lasted for weeks at a time.
44	553	The side effects I experienced were unusual spotting and weight gain
44	554	I've been spotting for about a week which I am told is normal.
44	555	I had a good experience with my first pack of pills - no spotting.
44	556	For the first two months you will have a lot of spotting, but if you push through those two months it goes away completely.
44	557	I haven't had any spotting in months and used to have an extremely heavy period.
44	558	Allow the spotting to happen just as if it was a period, and then resume your pill.
44	559	I found not always taking at the same time, within 2 hours, to be the cause of the spotting.
44	560	I am sure as much as it has already shortened my period I won't be spotting throughout the month.
44	561	I've been on this pill for about 3 years and recently started experiencing some spotting in between periods, even sometimes during sexual activity.
44	562	I didn't have any spotting on the 1st pack.
44	563	However, on just about every pack since then I've had anywhere from 1-3  weeks of spotting.
44	564	My gyno warned that spotting was the most common side effect of this pill.
44	565	I started week 5, the first week in the second container and instantly started spotting.
44	566	The first month of the pack, I don't bleed at all until about the last week I have some very light spotting that lasts up through the middle of the 2nd month/pack of pills....then it remains heavy from the middle of the 2nd month all the way through the end of the third month.
44	567	Started taking Jolessa after using the Nuva Ring and spotting almost non-stop.
44	568	I haven't had any spotting.
44	569	However, when I tried to skip my period (skip the white sugar pills and go to a new pack) I did have some spotting in the 5th week on the pink pills.
44	570	I had consistent spotting for MONTHS.
44	571	I've been spotting for about 2 weeks now, I get head aches, vivid nightmares, gained weight, terrible mood swings.
44	572	However, the spotting has been an absolute nightmare.
44	573	I had no spotting at all up until the end of month two, and the spotting has not stopped since (I am nearing the end of month three).
44	574	The spotting is the only negative side affect I have had thus far.
44	575	So I asked to go back to camrese and it worked for the first  5 months no problem but then I had spotting again.
44	576	I was spotting around the first month and then my schedule was back on track.
44	577	I had gotten spotting like last month but for like a day or two and that was it.
44	578	The only side effects I have had are a few headaches here and there and spotting once in awhile.
44	579	I previously had an arm implant and experienced spotting and weight gain that wouldn't stop.
44	580	After taking Quasense I've lost weight, no spotting, light & short periods.
44	581	There was also 5 weeks of spotting during the first 3 months on this pill.
44	582	I'd heard that I could have some spotting, especially in the first cycle, but I still get spotting starting about 3 weeks before my white pills (and it last up until then).
44	583	no spotting, this is my first time using birth control.
44	584	I was hesitant to use hormonal contraceptives because of mood swings and spotting.
44	585	The first two cycles I did experience some spotting, but it decreased and eventually ended.
44	586	A little over a year from starting the Camrese I began to get significant spotting (and I would take the pill at the EXACT same time everyday.
44	587	My period is officially 2 weeks long (I begin spotting and gradually have a heavier flow).
44	588	I've been on it for 4 months now and for 2 months straight I was spotting every single day.
44	589	The thing I dont necessarily like is I have spotting around the 3rd row of the pill almost a week before I am supposed to get my period, which is annoying.
44	590	I am on my 3rd month close to the sugar pills and I have been spotting for the past week and a 1/2.
44	591	Im currently taking this and the first two entire packs were fine some minimal spotting that went away within a few days.
44	592	After the first month I was spotting until I ended the entire pack.
44	593	When my period started on the last 7 days I got my new pack (91 pills), then there was no more spotting.
44	594	Then after that I kept spotting and was getting really frustrated.
44	595	I found out later that you can have spotting within the first three months.
44	596	Started it & my period still came as usual but wasn't that heavy, and then for the next 2 months I had spotting everyday.....but then the 3rd month maybe 1 or 2 days of breakthrough bleeding because I forgot to take a pill.
44	597	I've only been on Alesse for 3 weeks and since this is my first time on a birth control pill, I can't really say all that much except for the fact that i've been spotting for 5 days, I should be getting my period in about a week and I get cranky extremely easily  now (well more than normal) but other than that, it's been a decent experience so far I guess.
44	598	I've been spotting the whole first month.
44	599	No spotting after the first pack, once my body was regulated.
44	600	I had occasional spotting, and over the course of the past year I've gained 10 lbs (with no other lifestyle changes), which are the only reasons I will be discussing changing medication with my doctor.
44	601	Due to my new job I have been bad at taking the pill the same time every day which is causing a lot of spotting, which is my fault.
44	602	No spotting.
44	603	No spotting, just a little nausea for the first 2 days but that's it.
44	604	I've had no spotting and very light periods though.
44	605	The pills didn't cause any side effects or me, other than a constant spotting which is unimaginably irritating, and made me feel too embarrassed to get intimate making my annoyance for nothing.
44	606	I'm hoping that the spotting stops soon.
44	607	No depression, no major weight gain (I work out regularly so its hard to know for sure), no complete loss in sex drive, no spotting.
44	608	I have a very healthy libido and haven't had any spotting.
44	609	I'm constantly spotting from a lot to a little in a matter of hours.
44	610	I switched to Portia 12 days ago when I started spotting from another birth control (Alesse).
44	611	I have had no spotting yet (fingers crossed this continues).
44	612	I had dark brown spotting for three weeks, starting the second month.
44	613	In addition to the spotting, my sex desire doesn't exist.
44	614	I never got any side affects such as nausea, headaches and spotting like I was warned :)
44	615	I've been taking it for two months now and I have experienced spotting basically every single day since I started, sometimes light spotting, sometimes heavy, and it only stopped for one or two days.
44	616	I just want to stop spotting every day.
44	617	I had no spotting, no mood swings or any other side effects.
44	618	So, I started Jolessa and had minor spotting during the first few months, but nothing major.
44	619	Occasional bloating and spotting, but has worked well overall.
44	620	I've had no side effects, no spotting to bleeding other than when I should.
44	621	No spotting, period came as scheduled with the pills.
44	622	I experienced some light spotting after the first month, but nothing more.
44	623	Slight spotting here and there, maybe once or twice a year.
44	624	I've only had a little bit of spotting before my period is supposed to happen but it's nothing that I can't handle.
44	625	I've been spotting going on a month straight.
44	626	My doctor put me on Motrin 600 3 times a day for 5 days and that was supposed to help stop the spotting.
44	627	Hoping the spotting would stop soon since I start my 3 month in a couple days.
44	628	I haven't had my period or spotting since I started, however if you miss a day you will get it!
44	629	No spotting, but I was very nauseated.
44	630	On the second pack I began spotting and this continued for weeks at a time.
44	631	I am now at the end of my fourth pack and have been spotting for the entire last month!
44	632	It started as spotting, then turned into a full-on period.
44	633	I was spotting for two weeks, then I started my period.
44	634	I had a little spotting when I switched brands and that is all I have had.
44	635	I'm back to size 0, mental health is normal, and no more spotting.
44	636	I read a lot of reviews that talked about heavy spotting, I'm hoping that this won't happen to me or I'll have to change it.
44	637	I can handle the mood swings but the spotting was horrible.
44	638	I was very apprehensive to start the pills because of what I've heard about it as far as ongoing spotting that seemingly never ends.
44	639	However, I went into it with an open mind and expected some spotting.
44	640	The first two weeks felt like a regular period, and after that, minor spotting not even enough to wear a pad.
44	641	I would say by the end of the third week, all spotting was gone.
44	642	After a few days of spotting I get my period.
44	643	No side effects, no spotting, nothing.
44	644	I have had light spotting for the first few days and that's it.
44	645	Taking Jolessa started out good, no bleeding the first month but then the second month started spotting which lasted a pretty long while maybe 3 weeks.
44	646	And it wasn't just light spotting, I had bleeding similar to a period.
44	647	Around week 3 I started spotting for a couple of days then it would stop for a couple of days.
44	648	After 5 weeks I started spotting and it has not stopped and I am on week 9.
44	649	I am not unsatisfied with the pill just a little disappointed that I have no idea when the spotting will end.
44	650	I followed her instructions and toward the last 2 weeks of the 3rd set, I started seeing some "color" that led to spotting.
44	651	Now that I am on the 2nd pack toward the end, just about a week ago, I started spotting again.
44	652	During my 3 month trial, I found that the severity of my migraines intensified and spotting was equal to that of a light period.
44	653	I understand that spotting may occur and should decrease over time; however I was forced to wear a panty liner every day (sometimes 2/day!)
44	654	I've had no spotting at all.
44	655	The first few months were great, some spotting every now and then but nothing major.
44	656	Consequently, I have been spotting for the entire two months.
44	657	Basically started from week 7: spotting to pantyliner to regular pad (week 11).
44	658	I have never had spotting.
44	659	I did experience some light spotting, nothing scary or really inconvenient, during some of the 1st months and definitely towards my period pills.
44	660	I am happy to say it has been eights weeks and I am symptom free, no spotting, and best of all no PMS.
44	661	During week 5 I started spotting if thats what you'll call it and I am on week six and still spotting.
44	662	Week 2 and 3 I had spotting that did not need a pantyliner, okay I could handle "spotting".
44	663	The first cycle of pills I had a lot of spotting.
44	664	The second pack very little spotting.
44	665	Very little spotting.
44	666	We're not talking spotting here, this is a constant thing.
44	667	When I first started LoSeasonique, I had light spotting within a week that only lasted four days.
44	668	I am now 1 1/2 weeks into the next batch and still no spotting or anything!
44	669	I was always spotting and bleeding and having to wear protection for that everyday.
44	670	I have been taking Loseasonique for 3 and a half weeks now, and for the past 2 weeks or so have been experiencing what I think is spotting?
44	671	I would rather get my period for 4 days like I usually do than to have "spotting" for 2 weeks.
44	672	I'm going to try to stick it out for another 2 weeks or so at least but I don't know how long I can handle the "spotting" , and I'm afraid of possible future side effects.
44	673	No spotting and it was nice to not have a period for three months at a time.
44	674	My insurance wouldn't approve the original brand, which my RN mother-in-law says is better, but I've read about other women spotting on Seasonique too so its probably more personal experience.
44	675	Light spotting at least every few days and I still got a period even after my first month which lasted about 10 days as opposed to my short, but very painful ones.
44	676	I've been on this for a month and after the first two days I had spotting occur and it hasn't stopped since.
44	677	I too experienced a lot of spotting during my end of 2nd-beginning of 3rd month, almost 3 weeks.
44	678	I was on YAZ and it caused spotting and weight gain, after a year they switched me to Portia and I lost all the weight and haven't spotted since; also my PMS is completely nonexistent now and the killer mood swings I experienced on YAZ are gone too.
44	679	I love having only 4 periods a year, but it seems that every other 3 month cycle I having a lot of spotting.
44	680	Everything is normal for me but I've been bleeding lightly or should I say spotting for just about a month now.
44	681	Just ready for the spotting to stop, but other than that I have no other problems or symptoms.
44	682	I haven't got nausea or even had spotting.
44	683	I have been spotting for over 30 days.
44	684	No breakthrough bleeding, no spotting, no periods (unless I missed more than a pill, then I had some light spotting).
44	685	My only complaint was there was long spotting, about 8 days, for the first pack.
44	686	I use to get through my second month of pills & then I would spot for almost the entire 3rd month up until my period.
44	687	I “spot” bleed all the time.
44	688	I always spot one to two months before I am supposes to have a cycle.
44	689	It is now nearing November (9 months) & I have not had a single spot or period since I stopped taking birth control.
44	690	It was some days I would just spot out of nowhere.
44	691	It did NOT stop my period and actually made me spot for weeks at a time with awful bloating and some weight gain.
44	692	I was sent to er ( after my first 2 visits) to get checked for a PE, have had a million tests done, several ekg's and have an spot with a cardiologist.
44	693	Although you MUST take it at exactly the same time every day or you will spot earlier.
44	694	The next day I started the pill I stopped bleeding for a whole wk then the second week I began to spot.
44	695	I could only stick with this for like two weeks,  although I didn't spot or when I was on it I've been bleeding for 6 days since stopping it, never bled that long in my life.
44	696	I did not spot for the first two months.
44	697	I would be fine for the first month of the pills but literally, as soon as I start the second pack of the pills until I get my period, I spot.
44	698	No being 10, 20, 30 minutes late because otherwise you spot.
44	699	I didn't spot at all and when I did get my period it was very short and light.
44	700	I don't spot and I don't think I have gained any weight at all.
44	701	I would spot a month before i was supposed to get my period.
44	702	I rarely spot, and if I do it's a few days before im scheduled to get my period.
44	703	I spotted regularly and it made me anxious and at times some depression.
44	704	If I missed my dosing time by an hour I spotted.
44	705	Then, I spotted for 2 months straight.
44	706	After the first month, I spotted heavy enough to ruin underwear, but not enough to use a pad/tampon, up until month three when it was time for my actual period.
44	707	been on this for almost 2 months i took it while i started my period stop bleeding for two days and spotted for another 2weeks and been fine since then, but i did exprience nausea but importantly depression am stopping because am so down and out and i havent finished the 3 month pack...overall i really like this birth control but i cant deal with this depression
44	708	I spotted a lot during the first few months but after about 6-8 months, everything settled down.
44	709	I spotted every day for the first two weeks on Falmina.
44	710	I spotted occasionally on Camrese/Seasonique and yes, it's normal.
44	711	Only spotted lightly once and had a short, although heavy for two days, period on the white pills.
44	712	I spotted through almost the whole pack, every single time.
44	713	I've been taking this pill for two months now and I spotted on an off for the first few weeks.
44	714	On the third month I took the pill 4 hours late and I spotted lightly for two days.
44	715	I spotted frequently during those 2 months.
44	716	I'm moody but I haven't spotted or gained weight.
44	717	I spotted for several weeks (probably 6 weeks), gained weight (went from size 0 to a 4 -6) and felt depressed and suicidal.
44	718	The first 2 packs of the pills I spotted for 2 of the 3 months, mostly just light but sometimes it got heavy but once I started my 3rd pack everything was great.
44	719	I have been taking Jolessa for a month and a half, and I have spotted the entire time.
44	720	Once the panic attack ends, I get a headache more towards 5:00pm-6:00pm.
44	721	Within the first 24hrs I developed a headache.
44	722	On day 7 my headache had become unbearably bad.
44	723	I've lost 10 lbs and every time I take one of these pills I get an instant headache.
44	724	My skin is fine, can't comment on the headaches because I've had a consistent tension headache the entire time.
44	725	Just an occasional headache or stomach ache but nothing advil can't help.
44	726	I started bleeding with 5 days left on the pill and feeling nauseous with a headache here and there, fatigued, and achy everywhere!
44	727	I've been on the pill for little over a month I have terrible headache almost everyday and now I have this terrible pain in my left hand and going up a little bit.
44	728	With the headache I would just take asprin and it went away.
44	729	I think once my body readjusts to the medicine, my headache will go away.
44	730	Took Alesse for about 9 months, the only good thing is that it made my period less painful but besides that it gave me bad headaches, completely lost my sex drive, and made me irritable (mood swings) and most recently it caused me to have depression which I had never experienced until now.
44	731	My obgyn switched me to this from Sronyx, due to horrible mood swings, constant headaches and 10 day long periods.
44	732	I used to have horrible headaches daily and this bc has gotten rid of them!
44	733	Was very nervous to start a hormonal pill because I am prone to nausea and headaches.
44	734	Also, I never experienced headaches again since I stopped that pill.
44	735	I had chronic migraines for over a year before I started taking this, with no explanation as to why I was having such awful headaches every single day.
44	736	No mood swings no headaches everything is great.
44	737	It started with headaches, depression then I started having numbness and tingling on my left side.
44	738	When I first started it, I had severe back pain, headaches,  and mood swings.
44	739	I did have headaches when I just started cycle, but those went away after 3 days.
44	740	I get MASSIVE headaches, nausea, dizziness, and it makes my body really tender and sore down there, so sex hurts quite a bit sometimes.
44	741	I originally went on this Pill to assist with headaches experienced when premenstrual, the headaches have competed stopped and am pleased overall with no lasting side effects.
44	742	I have always had headaches and migraines growing up which is also a side effect to this contraceptive, they go away easily if I just drink plenty of water when I take the pill.
44	743	My mood is good, no nausea or headaches, and I think it's slowed my hair growth.
44	744	My periods are shorter, my anxiety is gone, not as much breast pain, no headaches EVER I can't remember the last time I had one and have not gotten pregnant.
44	745	The only side effects I experienced were very mild headaches, and nausea during the first 2 days of starting the pill.
44	746	I've always had headaches so I don't think I could tie that in with the BC pills.
44	747	Started having headaches ( I never ever have headaches), got my period for 10 days 6 weeks in, bp went from 100/60 to 158/98.
44	748	I dont think I saw any side effects but that might be because I already had headaches and nausea.
44	749	I'm also starting to develop headaches frequently but not sure if that's directly correlated.
44	750	I don't have migraines EVER, sometimes some headaches once in a while.
44	751	No vomiting, headaches, random nausea, or mood swings.
44	752	I've always gotten sodium headaches if I've eaten to much salt through out the day but now it's a bit more sensitive to alot of chips, too much gravy, and popeyes chicken.
44	753	So this was the first birth control I had taken and everything was fine the first three days, on the fourth day I randomly got sick, like hot flashes, lightheadedness, headaches, and vomiting, but after an hour and a half it went away.
44	754	However from that day on I always felt a bit off and had lightheadedness and headaches for an hour or so every day always at a different time even though I took my pill at the same time every day.
44	755	I have migraines but this pill doesn't give me headaches.
44	756	I get headaches more than usual as well.
44	757	And I get these horrible headaches everyday, they worsen when I don't take my pill right on time, even a few minutes late and they only get worse on the week I take the sugar pills.
44	758	I started with this pill to get off the shot but it is no better...I can't sleep at night I have the worst headaches my cycle is never predictable..I can see blood one day and nothing the next I can have sex one day and still bleed & that's so embarrassing & disgusting I hate this pill it was the worst choice ever
44	759	I started getting regular headaches again, so my Doctor switched me to a different brand that I have yet to try.
44	760	No headaches or anything like that.
44	761	I have terrible headaches , I'm always sleepy & lazy , always nauseous.
44	762	I have my sex drive back, no headaches, clear skin, and no weight gain!
44	763	I have been tired non stop, depressed, super emotional over the most simple things, have gained 15 pounds that I can't seem to shake, headaches, and my appetite has increased.
44	764	Ever since I switched I've been getting massive headaches, horrible cramping/bloating when on my cycles and just overall been feeling terrible for the past 2 months of taking it.
44	765	By the completion of the first week, I started to get these crippling headaches, nausea, and dizziness.
44	766	CONS: discharge (fair-quite significant amount), back aches and sometimes I get moderate-severe headaches.
44	767	), daily headaches, frequent nausea, I cry all the time for no reason, really bad anxiety.
44	768	I experienced no nausea, headaches, psychological side effects.
44	769	I haven't had any nausea, headaches or mood changes.
44	770	Just switched from the Nuva-ring because it was giving me horrible hormone headaches.
44	771	The first night I got awful headaches, and they carried on for the rest of the week.
44	772	I've been on this pill for about a little over a year and a half, I have had a very good experience so far, I never got headaches, pain or any of those things.
44	773	It has not affected my mood or sex drive, and I haven't had any headaches or anything like others have mentioned.
44	774	I still have bad skin, and although my anxiety is manageable it's still there, but at least I can get out of bed, and the headaches have slackened.
44	775	I did notice headaches but so far so good!
44	776	I used to get horrible migraine headaches around my menstrual cycle so I was put on continuous birth control.
44	777	No headaches.
44	778	Breakthrough bleeding, headaches ,nausea, bloating....
44	779	This pill has given me such headaches that I had to start taking the product around 8 in the evening so that it wouldn't bother me.
44	780	While on it, I had headaches for the first few weeks, but they subsided.
44	781	Additionally my skin became unmanageable, I started having massive headaches, I couldn't focus because of exhaustion (I slept 15 hours two days in a row and previously had a normal sleeping pattern) and I was so weak that getting out of bed became a task.
44	782	I have gained about 20lb, I get dizzy sometimes, headaches all the time, and I get break through bleeding about half way through my pills.
44	783	Breasts are constantly sore, severe mood swings, headaches and not to mention 10 pounds weight gain.
44	784	However, my PMS became  difficult to deal with, headaches, nausea, and fatigue.
44	785	I decided to try this because I get bad headaches during my period (even though they'd only last 3 days, 4 days at most) and I wanted to avoid it altogether.
44	786	I had migraines for years until I switched to this pill, now I no longer have headaches.
44	787	During this time I did not experience a migraine.
44	788	Ob-Gyn recommended me on birth control, and I haven't had a migraine for 1.5 years now!
44	789	I went into emergency at the hospital and was treated for a migraine... a migraine was not what the problem was I have a blood clot in my brain caused by being on this pill for 1 week.
44	790	I enjoy only having to deal with getting my period every 3 months and I haven't had a migraine yet.
44	791	At this point I think I'd rather live with the monthly migraine than be bleeding all the time and look like like I have chicken pox on my face.
44	792	I am going on day 2 of a horrible migraine.
44	793	I'm not sure about any other side effects as my migraine has masked everything else.
44	794	The second side effect I experienced was if not every day then every other day I'd get very bad migraines.
44	795	The only way I was able to connect my migraines to this brand of birth control was being on the 4th week/sugar pills.
44	796	My periods are super regular, libido is fine, no dryness, no migraines or weight gain, however I haven't seen a difference in acne/lighter or shorter periods/period pain but those aren't problems I needed fixed anyway.
44	797	No weight gain, no migraines, no anxiety or depression, decreased pms.
44	798	Plus I thought only being 29 having early menopause with hot flashes n migraines this would help me... not sure yet.
44	799	I've also been having really intense migraines, they've been so debilitating that I've almost burst into tears, the only reason I didn't was because it would have hurt far too bad.
44	800	I was getting bad migraines as well.
44	801	The third day and 3 days after I had severe migraines that never seemed to go away even after taking 2 400mg advils.
44	802	The migraines went away for a week but came back this week for another dreadful 4 days.
44	803	Couldn't handle it anymore and went to my doctor who advised me to stop taking the pills and wait a week to see if the migraines continue without the use of alesse.
44	804	It has helped with migraines (no hormone fluctuations) and did not have weight gain until my insurance tried to get me to take the GENERIC version.. Not the same, hence bioequivalent.
44	805	I switched to this one and have been on it for over a year because my previous (Sprintec) was giving me horrible migraines.
44	806	I switched to camrese because my last birth control was giving me consistent debilitating migraines during the week of my period or if I forgot a pill.
44	807	As mentioned in my previous post, I switched because of hormonal migraines.
44	808	It finally went away, skin is clear, I no longer get hormonal migraines.
44	809	You guessed it...migraines!
44	810	I was taken off of Yaz and put onto this because it was causing me migraines with aura.
44	811	I was switched to Jolessa by my OBGYN after 7 years of hormonal migraines the day before/of starting my period while on Spintec.
44	812	I ended up hospitalized with extreme high blood pressure and severe vascular migraines.
44	813	I got on this due to migraines I would have when I got my period.
44	814	I got on Jolessa because I get horrible migraines when I get my period, so having it just 4 times a year is much better than 12/13 (I got it every 22 days).
44	815	The first couple of weeks were a struggle for me, I got terrible migraines and  nausea every time I took the pill (I even stopped for a week and the side effects subsided, so it was the pill)!
44	816	At first I hated it because I was nauseous the first week with bad migraines, then it went away.
44	817	I started on Ortho-Tri-cyclen, but it literally gave me blinding migraines.
44	818	I also had minor (compared to the previous ones) migraines, but haven't had any in at least 8 months.
44	819	I have gained 15 lbs and get severe migraines during my period.
44	820	I am taking this to try and prevent 9-15 monthly migraines.
44	821	I am waiting this out only because I have such severe migraines.
44	822	I am still having migraines but, there not as severe.
44	823	I get occasional migraines, but it's nothing that I have had to complain to my doctor about.
44	824	I switched about 2 years ago after my previous birth control started giving me migraines and making me sick.
44	825	I am on it for the prevention of menstrual migraines, and so far I've gotten 1 but I imagine it'll take time, even so, 1 is an improvement.
44	826	I had stopped taking birth control for a year because of migraines, they improved and then worsened again.
44	827	My OBGYN switched me to this pill in hopes to reduce my menstrual migraines I suffer with every month.
44	828	I am trying birth control to see if it may help even out my migraines.
44	829	I'm experiencing hair loss, increased appetite, and severe migraines!
44	830	I started using this birth control because I was having migraines every period, so hopefully I will only have period induced migraines every three months.
44	831	Overall, I am glad I no longer have the monthly periods or migraines.
44	832	Since taking this pill my boobs have been hurting extremely bad, I’ve had cravings like a mad woman, been depressed, and I have no sex drive at all.
44	833	I had absolutely no sex drive the first 2 months of taking, but then it increased moderately.
44	834	I was moody and nasty, gained 10-15 pounds within the first two weeks of taking it, started to become depressed, and it completely reduced my sex drive.
44	835	I would get nausea, very emotional, low sex drive and thick discharge.
44	836	The only good thing about it was it increased my sex drive.
44	837	I switched to Ortho Tricylen Lo and I actually liked it but the only thing is it decreased my sex drive.
44	838	Felt the "Usual" nausea & fatigue thought it was normal, until I have been having stomach pain on my left side like if I had air, more gassy, low sex drive (thought it was the summer heat but not that), tired and back pain.
44	839	(My weight has never been this high) Plus my mood has been horrible, no sex drive.
44	840	It didn't mess with my sex drive (Yaz killed it).
44	841	My only side effect is sex drive has gone down quite a bit, I didn't really think about this one until I had it for myself.
44	842	Had sore nipples, tightness in chest; abnormal bleeding as well as loss of sex drive.
44	843	Oh and the fact that I have completely lost my sex drive!
44	844	My mood swings are so intense, zero sex drive, and I am snapping over little things.
44	845	The other major downfall of this medication is that I completely lost my sex drive.
44	846	I have a sex drive back and I am not as depressed.
44	847	The only thing that really sucks about it is that I have NO sex drive.
44	848	I have no sex drive, breasts are tender and don't want to be touch.
44	849	Im 42 yrs and a plus with CamreseLo is it gave me my sex drive back once it was regulated in my system.
44	850	And there is absolutely no sex drive!
44	851	Moodiness increased, sex drive lowered to the point where I didn't want anything to do with my partner, extremely emotional, painful periods and depressed.
44	852	I also swear it increases your sex drive but it could just be me.
44	853	My sex drive is almost completely gone.
44	854	I noticed I have been extremely tired and have a low sex drive.
44	855	I also have zero sex drive.
44	856	My only con is that my sex drive has greatly declined :( but luckily I have an amazing boyfriend to counteract that!
44	857	I'm going on my 3rd week taking this and for me it has caused, In  the first week or two, a lowered libido (sex drive) and vaginal dryness.. and I'm 16!!
44	858	My sex drive went to zero.
44	859	I have no sex drive; how can I when I'm bleeding every day at unpredictable times?
44	860	My sex drive has been the same, through the roof.
44	861	The only plus is that it didn't kill my sex drive and I didn't get pregnant
44	862	My sex drive is non-existent now since these awful pills.
44	863	I do feel like my sex drive has decreased and I've been feeling unusually tired and unmotivated this past week.
44	864	I've been on this birth control for about 2-3 years I would say, it is great for preventing pregnancy, but it has made my period weird, it stopped my period for 5 months, and stressed the hell out of me, I do feel incredibly tired taking this pill, and my sex drive isn't as high as it use to be before this pill.
44	865	I also have noticed my sex drive has spiked and so far no nasty side effects such as nausea or breast tenderness.
44	866	I haven't lost any sex drive.
44	867	I have been on seasonale for 2 yrs now and have now just realized that it's the reason I can't lose weight and I feel depressed and absolutely 0 sex drive.
44	868	Unfortunately, this birth control does lower your sex drive.
44	869	I went off it and my sex drive came back full force and plan to go off it permanently.
44	870	From month 8 to around month 16 for the 2 years I was taking it, my sex drive slowly decreased until it was nonexistent.
44	871	This pill also totally killed my sex drive.
44	872	The three biggest problems were the fact that ever since I have been on this I have absolutely no sex drive, at all, I have been so depressed and down, and I gained 20 pounds because of the hormone levels :(!
44	873	Sprintec made me feel foggy, moody and decreased my sex drive.
44	874	My sex drive hasn't changed.
44	875	I have no other side effects but the whole no sex drive thing kinda sucks
44	876	No sex drive what so ever!
44	877	Now I am considering going off the pill because for the last few months I have had a very low sex drive and gained 30 pounds since starting Alesse.
44	878	Also my sex drive did not decrease, but I have several mood swings
44	879	Now my sex drive decreased, chronic sinus infections....which I now link to this pill because over the last 7 months I have tried others and my sinuses have been great...now back on lessina and yet another sinus infection and clogged up nasal passages, rash on chest and bad melasma now.
44	880	Caused a lump in my right breast, sad mood, daily constant nausea, and NO sex drive.
44	881	But I have noticed a decrease in sex drive.
44	882	Other side effects included extremely increased sex drive, aggression, and mood swings.
44	883	I will say that after a year or so of taking Jolessa I did lose the sex drive.
44	884	I haven't noticed any severe change in my mood, maybe a little more sensitive than normal, and definitely no change in my sex drive.
44	885	No sex drive, my breasts ache badly, and my mood swings/anger/depression is CONSTANT.
44	886	However, one thing I have noticed since meeting my boyfriend and becoming sexually active with him is that this pill kills sex drive dramatically.
44	887	In my case, the convenience of only having 4 periods a year outweighs the inconvenience of having decreased sex drive.
44	888	Bad: I am completely insane on this pill, extreme mood swings, never happy always in a lulled state of lazy depression, brought to tears by every and anything, constantly tired, no motivation, really low sex drive.
44	889	The yeast infections, laziness and diminished sex drive basically erase the need for a birth control pill anyway.
44	890	I'm pretty sure my sex drive has increased.
44	891	The good thing is that I did seem to have a little bit higher sex drive.
44	892	However, I must say my sex drive has decreased a ton.
44	893	No weight gain or increased appetite and my sex drive is thriving.
44	894	My sex drive has increased and I have been less moody.
44	895	I've also noticed that my sex drive is much higher... like, MUCH higher!
44	896	I do notice a drop in sex drive, and just heavy feeling.
44	897	If you're looking for a birth control that's easy on your body in the sense that you don't get mood swings, no weight gain, good sex drive, etc., you might like Alesse.
44	898	I don't really have problems with PMS at all, but have noticed a lower sex drive.
44	899	Over the last several months on Levlen I've noticed my moodiness increasing and my sex drive drastically decreasing.
44	900	It's great except I have an EXTREMELY noticeable decrease in sex drive.
44	901	I've been taking this medication for two and a half years now- with no ill side effects other than slight decrease in sex drive.
44	902	I was depressed, I hated everything and everyone evolving the world... No sex drive at 19!!!
44	903	The biggest negative for me is my libido reduction.
44	904	It works great as birth control, I have not gotten pregnant or had any scares-- libido unaffected.
44	905	No affects on my libido or my anxiety.
44	906	The only thing I've noticed is a significant decrease in libido.
44	907	I switched from Sprintec because I noticed that I was moody, had low libido, and felt very nauseous often.
44	908	My libido is high, weight gain only 5-10 lb.
44	909	I switched from Sprintec to Kurvelo because the side effects were getting unbearable (sore boobs, low libido, very dry during sex, depression, mood swings).
44	910	This medication demolished my libido.
44	911	Two weeks after stopping it, my libido is back to normal now.
44	912	I have been taking this pill for almost two weeks and it has increased my libido times 100 and I am feeling normal again... Not as many mood swings as before and no depression.
44	913	When I first began birth control years ago, they put me on one that made me so moody, depressed, killed my libido and changed my personality, it felt.
44	914	And it not only increased my libido, it made my O very strong and last longer.
44	915	I'm not blaming the birth control for the weight gain but I'm looking forward to getting my libido back.
44	916	Four days ago, I switched to Syeda (a Yasmin generic) and already I feel better - and my libido has improved.
44	917	Down side would be reduced libido.
44	918	No problem with weight gain or being emotional (thank goodness) but I just went to my doctor and recently told her about my problems and have just been switched to a brand with a higher concentration.
44	919	I’ve also lost confidence in myself (my body), probably because of the weight gain.
44	920	I typically don't experience much weight gain with birth control, have regular and fairly light periods, and nice skin.
44	921	I do like that it shortened my periods, aside from the breakthrough bleeding, and no weight gain.
44	922	No weight gain, no mood swings, no change in appetite, no sleeplessness, nothing!
44	923	I haven't noticed any weight gain at all, and my period are super light.
44	924	Not to mention the weight gain!
44	925	Staying on for another week or soo see what happens and the weight gain for me is the worst I don't fit in my pants, plus need new bras.
44	926	I need a different pill cause the weight gain is absolutely terrible!!
44	927	I would have specific periods of sadness as well, but no weight gain.
44	928	I have had no weight gain, rarely any breast tenderness and it prevents pregnancy, so I can't complain too much.
44	929	I've had no weight gain and my periods are extremely light.
44	930	I've been on Lessina for about 7 months and the only side effects I can notice are that my breast are always sensitive and about 5-10 pound weight gain.
44	931	I would make sure to take in account weight gain this may cause before deciding on this particular brand.
44	932	I discontinued Amethia mostly due to mood change & weight gain.
44	933	The only bad effects I've had is weight gain, bloating, and increase in appetite.
44	934	I've read many reviews and weight gain is an issue but if you workout regularly you should see decrease in bloating
44	935	While the pill was 100% effective in preventing pregnancy and shortening periods/lessening pain, I experienced the following side effects:  high heart rate (often times would not slow down enough to sleep at night,  severe anxiety as a secondary effect, low mood as a secondary effect of anxiety/lack of sleep, increased sensitivity to sugar and caffeine, bloating (more often than not), weight gain.
44	936	No weight gain or mood changes either that I have noticed!
44	937	Remember when Caty gave Regina the swedish weight gain bars and said they were for losing weight, and then Regina ended up wearing sweatsuits everyday, but Caty said to "give them a chance?"
44	938	No weight gain.
44	939	I have always been 110-112 lbs, and then after starting Jolessa, almost immediate weight gain of 7-8 lbs even though I am still just as active and eat very healthy.
44	940	I had a weight gain of 7 pounds within a week & a half.
44	941	In the first two months I experienced weight gain and a bit of nauseous and swelling of my breasts.
44	942	I have no other complaints EXCEPT, the weight gain.
44	943	I've never had problems with weight gain from BC's except for this one...this is ridiculous.
44	944	No weight gain or any other side effects.
44	945	Yasmin was really bad for depression and weight gain I didn't like it.
44	946	My first month 2 months were great no period mild bloating a little weight gain and my boobs went up an entire cup size(No issues with this)...
44	947	That, on top of the (what seems irreversible) weight gain and mood swings, has made this experience HORRIBLE.
44	948	It's effective but its not worth  severe, uncomfortable bloating and weight gain.
44	949	One side effect I did experience was weight gain.
44	950	But after 6 months I've seen great increase in weight gain and I'm eating more healthy than I ever was and I exercise daily.
44	951	I'm so frustrated with this birth control and almost stopped taking it all together, but I'm happy to say I'm changing back to my old one and hope this weight gain goes down.
44	952	I experienced severe mood swings, depression (and I am usually a happy person),  bloating, weight gain, increased appetite, breast tenderness, discomfort and pain in my abdomen and extreme fatigue.
44	953	My face did get better while on it, but nothing is worth the emotional unstableness and weight gain I am experiencing.
44	954	I did not experience weight gain and it's so nice to have control over my body.
44	955	Other than the weight gain, being hungry all the time and soreness in my breast, this birth control is pretty good.
44	956	My doctor switched me from YAZ to Alesse to help with the weight gain that YAZ gave me (20 pounds in 1 year) and I hate this birth control.
44	957	I do believe birth control has been a contributing factor to my weight gain however.
44	958	I've noticed bad bloating and weight gain.
44	959	No weight gain or bloating.
44	960	I had been taking Seasonique, but had some weight gain and mood swings so my doctor recommended Quasense.
44	961	I experienced no weight gain at all, I was actually hoping for weight gain.
44	962	I used to avoid hormonal birth control because of reccurent yeast infections and weight gain, but with Alesse, I have no problems!
44	963	No weight gain, no infections, no nausea, but sometimes my breasts hurt a little.
44	964	I had no weight gain.
44	965	I have noticed weight gain that I did not have with my other pills.
44	966	No mood swings, no weight gain, clear skin, etc.
44	967	I think my boobs got a little bigger and there was no weight gain and drastically lighter periods.
44	968	Not sure about weight gain, perhaps a few pounds but I'm making an extra effort to eat better and exercise.
44	969	I went to the doctor a month ago for a checkup and also noticed I've gained 10 pounds...I've never gained weight on a birth control pill, safe to say I'm officially done with Ashlyna
44	970	I haven’t gained weight, and my body shape looks much more pear-like.
44	971	I've been on Portia for 3.5 months and have gained 5 pounds and have been depressed and anxious the whole time - I wake up in the middle of the night crying or am unable to sleep because of the anxiety.
44	972	I started taking it at the beginning of October and since then I have noticed I have gained weight.
44	973	Also, I have major mood swings now, depression, and gained weight with taking this.
44	974	The downsides are that I gained 15-20 lbs with no lifestyle change, and I am super moody, depressed, anxious, etc anymore.
44	975	I gained 7lbs in 3 weeks even with my healthy diet and exercise.
44	976	I Never gained weight and levora maintained everything perfectly.
44	977	It also makes me break out & gained about 5 pounds.
44	978	I have gained 15 pounds within the last year!!
44	979	I've definitely gained a little bit of weight.
44	980	I gained 5 lbs in the matter of 4 days.
44	981	I had also gained 30+ lbs in the two years since beginning Amethia, but having always struggled with my weight I wasn't as concerned with that issue because I thought I just needed to diet.
44	982	I've been on Altavera for 2 months and I've gained  12 lbs already.
44	983	I've gained 10 pounds.
44	984	It was until recently that I noticed that over the last 6 months, I've gained 20 lbs!!!
44	985	Haven't gained weight because I eat pretty healthy and go to the gym regularly.
44	986	I haven't gained any weight which is great but I've become super irritable.
44	987	I gained 15 pounds in two weeks, and I was depressed and crying all the time.
44	988	I've gained around 10lbs just in 3 weeks of taking this medication.
44	989	I have since gained 20 pounds and am very moody.
44	990	I also gained a lot of weight on the pill throughout the years.
44	991	While on Depo, I gained 30 lbs and I experienced every side effect.
44	992	Another fun side effect I found is that I have gained a ton of weight.
44	993	I have gained 10lbs.
44	994	Also pretty sure I gained some weight while on it.
44	995	On the down side I have become terribly depressed, and have gained a LOT of weight.
44	996	I have been on this pill for a month and gained 12lbs!
44	997	It gave me horrible breakouts for an entire week during each month and I gained a significant amount of weight.
44	998	I gained weight while on it which is not like me because I am very careful with my body.
44	999	On Depo I gained a lot of weight and was unable to control my emotions.
44	1000	However, since I've started this brand I have gained a ton of weight.
44	1001	I do feel bloated, I feel that my stomach looks bigger, and overall I feel fatter, however the number on the scale has not changed so I cannot say I have gained weight.
44	1002	After losing 20 pounds 3 years ago, I've gained 15 of it back in 2.5 months without any change in diet.
44	1003	I haven't gained any weight, my skin is still relatively clear.
44	1004	Not to mention, I gained 15 pounds (that was probably a combination of hormones and the fact I didn't feel motivated to actually exercise).
44	1005	I'm into fitness and I gained 6 freaking pounds.
44	1006	I gained 30 pounds within 6 months of starting Jolessa.
44	1007	I've noticed that I've gained a little bit of weight especially around my tummy/hips.
44	1008	I have night sweats, my boobs hurt,  I've gained like 20 pounds and I think  I am depressed
44	1009	Jolessa does just fine at preventing pregnancy and I have not had any other horrible side effects that others have had EXCEPT I literally gained 10-12lbs the first month I took it.
44	1010	I am switching to TriNessa next week and hopefully will be able to lose what I have gained while on Jolessa.
44	1011	In the last month I've gained 3 lbs in what I believe to be water weight, as I feel quite bloated.
44	1012	I experienced severe nausea and gained 10 pounds but lost them shortly after.
44	1013	So far, I've had a light to moderate period the first two months and have gained around 6-7 pounds.
44	1014	When I started taking jolessa, I gained weight very quickly, going from 160lbs (I was 145lbs before depo shot) to 200lbs in like 6 months.
44	1015	2 months in, I gained 15 pounds.
44	1016	Using alesse I have gained almost 10 pounds the last few months of use!
44	1017	Also gained 25 lbs in two years.
44	1018	Ever since I started this brand, I have gained 27 pounds, had drastic mood swings right before/ while I am on my period and night sweats.
44	1019	I eat normally (haven't lost my appetite and am not nauseous), haven't gained weight (I do work out regularly though), and my skin has gotten slightly better.
44	1020	I'm on my second period and I feel like I've gained 10 pounds from bloating.
44	1021	Within the first four days I gained 3.5 lbs and my boobs shrank a cup size (?????)
44	1022	I also gained about 25 pounds while on this.
44	1023	I gained 10 pounds.
44	1024	I've gained 10 pounds in 5 months and am depressed that it's summer and I can't fit in my size 4 clothes anymore.
44	1025	I have gained about 17 pounds but I think that's because I stopped exercising rigorously since graduating high school.
44	1026	I went on this pill so that I didn't have to have my period every month, but within the first 2 weeks I gained 10 pounds.
44	1027	I've also gained 20 pounds for no apparent reason and basically stopped having periods.
44	1028	I gained a little weight but other than that, I love it.
44	1029	I gained 20 lbs the first time on it, went off, lost some of the weight, went back on it, and haven't gained since.
44	1030	My complexion is getting better, I've had no unusual depression or anxiety and I haven't gained additional weight.
44	1031	I gained a cup size and maintained my weight.
44	1032	I have gained about 10 lbs over 2 years but like most women have said, it's water retention.
44	1033	I gained 10 pounds after being on it for 1-2 months, but have been able to get that 10 down to 5.
44	1034	This is my 3rd month on this birth control and so far my breast has gotten bigger, they have been sore, I happen to be hungry all the time and have gained a good 10 pounds.
44	1035	Unfortunately, I have gained at least 20 lbs and have gone from a 36D to a 36DD (possibly larger).
44	1036	I have gained weight, about 10 pounds, and went up 1 bra size, without any change in diet or my exercise program.
44	1037	It has no effect on my mood, I never gained weight on it, and I basically feel pretty normal when I take it.
44	1038	I was on Loestrin and I had gained 25 lbs over a 2 year period.
44	1039	Over a 2 month period I was able to drop almost all the weight I had gained.
44	1040	Over 1 month I gained 7 lbs and became very moody (just as I was on the Loestrin) I have asked my DR to send over a new prescription with no generic marked.
44	1041	Additionally, I lost my appetite almost completely and probably ate less than 1500 calories a day, AND gained weight!
44	1042	Although I notice I gained a little weight, I still enjoy 8 months out of the year with no period and I love it!
44	1043	I have gained weight and my depression has gotten worse.
44	1044	I have gained no weight from it.
44	1045	I've been miserable and bloated and have gained a few pounds.
44	1046	I just hate that I gained weight, have normally low grade fevers and cant sleep at night.
44	1047	I slowly gained 10 lbs over the 2-yr period.
44	1048	The only real side effect I’ve had is a little bit of nausea, so I really can’t complain.
44	1049	No nausea, bloating, or water retention.
44	1050	I wake up in the middle of the night at 5:00 am every night with extreme nausea, something that I didn't experience before taking this.
44	1051	Number one is the nausea.
44	1052	Everyday for the last couple of months I would feel slight nausea to the point where I thought maybe I was pregnant.
44	1053	I did some research that the pills give you nausea so I waited and continued taking it with food before intaking it and still nothing worked.
44	1054	I would cry for anything and started getting so much nausea, I couldn't even eat at all only drink water !!
44	1055	The typical nausea and mood swings.
44	1056	However, after around a year and half on it I developed extreme anxiety, panic attacks, severe moodiness and change of temperament, as well as nausea every single day.
44	1057	took this for 1 month and experienced no major mood swings or nausea.
44	1058	I also don't experience the nausea some have mentioned.
44	1059	When I started, I had breakthrough bleeding for about 3 weeks and a little nausea.
44	1060	I'm not and emotional person under any means and eat like a full grown man usually but since starting this I haven't been able to eat at all because of the nausea and have had random uncontrollable mood swings.
44	1061	I felt the nausea and vomiting.
44	1062	However after about a week the nausea was gone and in the third month the no other side effects except bleeding were felt.
44	1063	The first four weeks there was nothing, all was well other than a little nausea while adjusting to the new pill.
44	1064	It is only my fifth day on this medication, and I have only had a tiny bit of nausea.
44	1065	I have not actually vomited but the nausea is debilitating!
44	1066	It was  terrible I had irritability, nausea, etc.
44	1067	I have been bleeding for 3 weeks now & I am nausea mostly everyday.
44	1068	My nausea was terrible that I could not eat anything, engage in sexual activities without the urge of vomiting and be dizzy.
44	1069	The first week was a little tough for me since I had minor feelings of nausea in the morning and threw up 3 times that same week.
44	1070	I also had some nausea and I was hungry all the time.
44	1071	I had extreme nausea the first three days, extreme anxiety for three days after that, and painful breasts that followed and have not stopped.
44	1072	The worst parts were the nausea, major mood swings, slight depression (cried every night), anxiety, and the lack of motivation in everything.
44	1073	When I first became sexually active, I started a one month at a time pack, (I don't remember which one) but after a few months, I couldn't take the nausea anymore.
44	1074	I get nausea shortly during this time, but it's nothing compared to before.
44	1075	I've been taking Camrese Lo for about a month now I haven't had any serious side effects like nausea heartburn or abnormal bleeding.
44	1076	On week 2 to the present I've had extreme left breast tenderness and nausea, week 3-5 I had gross brown discharge, on week 5 to present I've had a heavier than normal menstrual cycle.
44	1077	By month 5 I had  chronic nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach.
44	1078	I no longer got nausea after taking it like with my old pills and it cut down my period.
44	1079	No bleeding or nausea.
44	1080	I only had mild nausea the first 4 days I started taking Loseasonique and it stopped pretty quickly.
44	1081	I only get nauseous if I don't eat when I take it.
44	1082	When I wake up in the morning I instantly feel dizzy and nauseous.
44	1083	After six months of use I started to get very nauseous because of this medication.
44	1084	I'm 18 and this is my first hormonal contraceptive I've tried, I was pretty scared at first about all the negative side effects - I did experience some intense mood swings and feeling nauseous at night in the first two weeks but I trusted it would go away, and it did.
44	1085	I was nauseous, my breast were tender and swollen.
44	1086	Vienva has made me nauseous for 10 minutes and that's it.
44	1087	This BC made me nauseous for the two months that I was taking it.
44	1088	I lost a little weight but because I was nauseous all the time.
44	1089	Overall, I don't get moody or nauseous nearly as much as I did on Sprintec, and it's so nice only dealing with a period 4 months a year instead of 12!
44	1090	Results are varied, have had slightly​ nauseous the first two weeks.
44	1091	When I first started this medication the whole first month I would feel super nauseous and sick.
44	1092	The first and second day were fine but on the third day I had a family event to go too and on the way there I began to feel disgustingly nauseous.
44	1093	I've only felt that nauseous when I had mono and after I got my tonsils out.
44	1094	I'm almost In my 3rd month of taking it and I get dizzy, weak, tired and nauseous.
44	1095	The next day I instantly felt nauseous and tired.
44	1096	I also feel very nauseous, like I could throw up any minute.
44	1097	I'm constantly nauseous and I mean constantly.
44	1098	The first 4 days I was so insanely nauseous.
44	1099	I have been a bit nauseous on it as I take Alesse in the morning, but nothing unmanageable.
44	1100	The first day I felt fine, just not hungry, and the second third and fourth days I have been very nauseous every morning and I think I have lost weight.
44	1101	I jumped onto Levlen just under a week ago and since then I have been CONSTANTLY nauseous, to the point that I can't even concentrate at work.
44	1102	Been slightly nauseous switching back to an oral pill.
44	1103	The first month, I felt dizzy, anxious, depressed, and disorientated.
44	1104	One day at school, I was starting to see double and I was feeling extremely dizzy.
44	1105	Also the previous BC was making me feel like I was going crazy with mood swings and dizziness.
44	1106	I still get mood swings but now they're more crying instead of yelling and snapping at people.
44	1107	First two months were complete breakthrough bleeding for almost 2 months straight & the third month I have no breakthrough bleeding, BUT my mood swings are horrible.
44	1108	So far, no random mood swings.
44	1109	I recently switched to this about a month ago and within this month I have had major mood swings.
44	1110	the only 2 good things is that my boobs grew a lot and after the first month of horrible mood swings it goes away
44	1111	I have been soooooo depressed and my mood swings are so out of control.
44	1112	No mood swings or bloating, either.
44	1113	I have a semi-rare medical condition where I get intense, horrendous mood swings due to a horomone imbalance.
44	1114	As much as I liked this pill, I did have mood swings at the beginning, but by the end of taking Altavera I was fine!
44	1115	I had mood swings, worsened anxiety and depression, and I was tired all the time.
44	1116	I didn't have any mood swings.
44	1117	I've also had less mood swings.
44	1118	This birth control made me have crazy mood swings and feel very depressed.
44	1119	I started on this birth control 3 months ago and it has given me awful mood swings, and intense mood feelings.
44	1120	All the others I bled for months and had super crazy mood swings.
44	1121	But my only issues that I can't deal with are the mood swings, bad dreams and tiredness.
44	1122	I was not expecting any of these side effects since I thought there was not a difference in medication, but the crazy mood swings and tiredness  terrible.
44	1123	I've been having mood swings and depression!!!
44	1124	Now this also happened to corrolate with me finally conquering my decade long opiate addiction so I'm not sure how much of my mood swings were attributed to that or the BC  but the mood swings were intense.
44	1125	My mood swings were under control and I could fully function theough my day without have to feel ill.
44	1126	I haven't experienced any mood swings (besides my normal PMSing), no decrease in sex-drive, and no adverse skin reactions.
44	1127	My skin has cleared, I have no PMS, no mood swings and obviously rarely have periods.
44	1128	But no mood swings, or weight gain/loss.
44	1129	I've also been experiencing breast tenderness (usually in the morning, it feels like I'm going through puberty all over again lol) perhaps and little bit of breast enlargement (which hey, I'm not complaining about) and abit of mood swings
44	1130	I then started getting awful mood swings where i was angry and upset all the time.
44	1131	I get constant mood swings.
44	1132	My mood swings are all over the place (I'll cry and get cranky over the dumbest things ALL THE TIME)..Definitely would not recommend this birth control and plan to go off it asap.
44	1133	Crazy mood swings, I've had my period for 2 months straight now, & I'm extremely tired.
44	1134	Didn't really gain much weight, just water weight around my hips and boobs (those were constantly sore as well), such bad mood swings and depressed and anxious often.
44	1135	Was trying these pills to help with my terrible mood swings and irritability during PMS, but I almost rather go back to that then the side effects I'm feeling now.
44	1136	This pill is not so bad, no weight gain/ acne/ or mood swings.
44	1137	I'm having CRAZY mood swings.
44	1138	First time using alesse been gaining weight like crazy my mood swings are all over the place my period been starting a week early so now my period lasts about 2 weeks.
44	1139	And the mood swings I've been experiencing are ridiculous!
44	1140	I just got the birth control today, I haven't tried it yet because my biggest fear is gaining weight and having very bad mood swings!
44	1141	No mood swings to report or any other side effects.
44	1142	What prompted me to look for other forms of BC was that my mood swings would occur a week before, during, and after my period to the point where I was overwhelmed with unexplained anger/frustration.
44	1143	I'm rating it at a 5 because my mood swings were out of control!
44	1144	It's easy to blame mood swings and being upset on other parts of your life, but for me it was ongoing and I knew it wasnt normal for me.
44	1145	My mood swings have also been pretty bad since starting Portia causing me and my boyfriend of over a year to fight a lot more often.
44	1146	No mood swings.
44	1147	I will be discontinuing this birth control today because my mood swings were affecting me too much.
44	1148	My mood swings have calmed down and I am not affected at all!
44	1149	So mood swings are definitely a side effect.
44	1150	I thought something was wrong with me but nope, I got all checked out by a OB and the pill just causes me to not bleed which is fine by me, I do however get sore breast every month when it should be my period and I have slight mood swings.
44	1151	I have no crazy mood swings.
44	1152	This year, however, my boyfriend and I noticed I would have severe mood swings in my third week of active pills.
44	1153	At first I had mood swings, I'd be fine then next thing I'm angry then I'm crying over something stupid.
44	1154	I had serious mood swings making me so mean and a totally different person.
44	1155	I have also noticed I have crazy mood swings and so has my boyfriend.
44	1156	My mood swings are gone and I have not had any noticeable side effects.
44	1157	When I started this pill my mood swings evened out and my period not only got less painful but shortened to only 3 days.
44	1158	I used this pill during my teens and it caused irritability and heavy mood swings.
44	1159	Perhaps it was just teen angst but I tried microgynon recently, which uses the same hormones just different levels, and experienced similar mood swings and depression.
44	1160	Every pill I've tried since makes me sore, bloated and causes strange mood swings.
44	1161	No mood changes because it's a lower hormone dosage than most pills, and my period is very normal.
44	1162	I experienced some mood changes which is a side effect.
44	1163	So far so good with this pill - I am 3 weeks in and haven't had any breakthrough bleeding or mood changes.
44	1164	I however just recently started having sex, and overall I am a nervous person about getting pregnant, but so far all good!
44	1165	Makes me nervous that maybe I have a blood clot or maybe it's made me infertile, and it makes me worry that I'm just going to get a horrible period in a week or two unexpectedly.
44	1166	Obviously right now I'm very moody and nervous but that's not the normal.
44	1167	I was very nervous this birth control would increase my breast size, just because I have naturally big boobs (38DD) and don't want them bigger.
44	1168	I was nervous to go to the doctor to get birth control every month because I already hated having it so far apart.
44	1169	I was so nervous to try it, but I'm glad I did.
44	1170	I was anxious and depressed all the time, to the point where I really considered how I was going to live my life like this.
44	1171	Yes, I got super anxious and depressed but when I found something that made me happy it felt as if the happiness permeated my entire being.
44	1172	Lately though I have felt extremely anxious & I hope this pill won't turn out like Larin Fe where I felt so crazy and anxious 24/7!!
44	1173	I was very concerned, anxious and depressed.
44	1174	I have zero history of anxiety or depression but this medication made me a completely different person.
44	1175	I never had any break through bleeding on Portia, but I developed moderate depression and anxiety issues while on it.
44	1176	Half way through the day the anxiety starts to take over.
44	1177	Also, my anxiety was super bad too right when starting this.
44	1178	I was taking falmina for only one month, on my last week of almost being done with the first pack, I started getting panic attacks, depression, and anxiety.
44	1179	I got bad chest pains, racing heart, anxiety and GERD.
44	1180	When I started taking it, the first two weeks were constant crying and shaking from my anxiety sky rocketing.
44	1181	It increased my anxiety substantially which is a problem as I already have GAD and panic disorder.
44	1182	I've gone through a roller coaster of emotions from anxiety, to anger, to just sobbing for no reason.
44	1183	I have  seen that a lot of girls that took this had severe anxiety and depression which happened to me.
44	1184	While I was on it I had anxiety for a whole month and I was depressed, I stopped taking it about a month ago, I still have anxiety but not as bad as  did before.
44	1185	If you have previous issues with anxiety or panic, do not take it!
44	1186	By day 4 I was having anxiety and panic attacks for no reason...it was so debilitating.
44	1187	I experience stomach pain once in a while now but my anxiety is basically under control.
44	1188	Prior to taking this pill, I had occasional anxiety but I've NEVER had depression in my life.
44	1189	About 2-3 months after taking the pill, I started experiencing increased anxiety & panic attacks (depersonalization/derealization, heart racing, difficulty breathing).. then came constant crying spells and depression to the point where I would lay in my bed for days.
44	1190	Its only been a month since stopping it and I feel 100% better.. No more crying, anxiety, panic attacks, etc.
44	1191	The anxiety is through the roof.
44	1192	I am a very mellow person and recently I have been having the worst anxiety and it's definitely because of this.
44	1193	I went off it about a month ago and I still have the worst depression and anxiety.
44	1194	But now I'm in my second month and I thought I continued to be side effect free until I've become crazy depressed, angry, irrational, anxiety, and I blamed it all on the fact that it is the end of my semester so I have a ton of finals and stuff to worry about.
44	1195	It also made my anxiety really bad and gave me mild depression.
44	1196	I also feel irritated and a lot of anxiety.
44	1197	I have been waiting for the drugs to get out of my system (the half life is about a month) and I am light headed have the worst anxiety ( never ever had it before so it really hard to deal with which is making it worse), really jittery and and not happy.
44	1198	For TWO years I thought I had undiagnosed generalized anxiety disorder until I went off the pill for a week and realized that I slept every night and was 100% calm and my heart rate finally felt normal.
44	1199	I have terrible anxiety and extreme exhaustion.
44	1200	It gave me the worst anxiety I've ever had in my life.
44	1201	But I have a long list of mental health problems,  and I dont know if I am just having an episode, or if this medication is causing the depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts to be so strong.
44	1202	I already suffered from anxiety,  this made it worse.
44	1203	Started taking Camrese to combat PMS-related anxiety, and it totally leveled me out.
44	1204	I've heard the complaints about it, but I have always had an anxiety and maybe a depression problem so I want to see if Portia caused it.
44	1205	But overall, I feel very "calm" with less anxiety.
44	1206	Breast tenderness lasted the entire time.
44	1207	I also experienced a little breast tenderness during the first week.
44	1208	The only negative is that I have breast tenderness pretty much the entire month.
44	1209	I've had a bit of breast tenderness, but nothing that bothers me.
44	1210	I had side effects including breast tenderness and sweats for the first month of taking this pill.
44	1211	Occasionally I have breast tenderness during the third week of the active pills right before my period.
44	1212	I would most definitely recommend this birth control, only negative things I find annoying at times is breast tenderness.
44	1213	The most noticeable side effect thus far has been breast tenderness.
44	1214	The breast tenderness I experienced was a minimum soreness for a month.
44	1215	I do feel more stressed, have tender breasts, and less energy but nothing too extreme.
44	1216	No sore breasts.
44	1217	I also got very sore breasts which I never dealt with before so it really bothered me.
44	1218	Breasts hurt.
44	1219	I started noticing that my discharge was changing and I would have itching like I have a yeast infection.
44	1220	I made an appointment with my (GYN), I did indeed have a yeast infection I was prescribed either the diflucan 150mg or the
44	1221	It gave me a reoccuring bacterial vagenosis and a yeast infection.
44	1222	After the first month, I started having severe external itch, got tested for yeast infection but it wasn't it.
44	1223	However almost immediately after I began pack 1 I experienced yeast infections due to the high levels of hormones.
44	1224	I would recommend this to patients who have had difficulties with frequent UTIs and yeast infections due to the pill.
44	1225	Worst breakouts I have ever had, and perpetual yeast infections.
45	1	Only issue I have been noticing lately is acne.
45	2	I have never had acne issues up until now and I'm 21.
45	3	Have any of you ladies had acne issues while on this patch and if so what did you do?
45	4	I always had an issue with acne and patch helped to solve that too.
45	5	I've only had the patch on for a week and I have alreaty gotten 2 cystic acne flare ups.
45	6	My biggest concern is the fact that i have never had bad acne.
45	7	When I first started the patch I had the worse acne of my life on my face for a couple weeks.
45	8	They include the glue trapping fuzziness, the visibility of it, gaining weight (I gained 10 lbs), decreased sex drive, vaginal dryness, increased hunger, really sore & swollen breasts, increased acne & oily skin, periods lasting longer.
45	9	Both the pills and the patch keep my face clear of acne which is a plus.
45	10	The first time using the patch I used it for 8-9 months and liked the fact that I had regular 3 day periods, no acne, and no weight gain.
45	11	My periods were on point, no cramps, no acne, no bloating, no lowered libido, no mood swings.
45	12	I used to have acne but it is all cleared up now I did go off the birth control for a little bit when I started back up I put the patch on too soon and then I ended up having my period for an entire month until the next cycle happens so with my experience and don't put your patch on before you get your period if you're just starting it.
45	13	But no weight gain, no acne breakouts, no red bumps, no nausea.....
45	14	So I found as soon as I started the patch, first 3 days extremely nauseous, within the first week my fave and chest broke out crazy in deep cystic acne, I didn't have any acne before, and it cause libido (major decrease in sex drive) as well as made me super emotional and just angry all the time, so therefore I immediately switched back off of it due to too many unwanted side effects, just bought the Nuvaring I hear good things about it and hear it's a very low dosage ... Hopefully not as many side effects involved.
45	15	It was mostly fine, didn't help my acne any and didn't give me boobs (I was all hips in those days) but also didn't give me any nausea or weight gain.
45	16	I however think I've gotten acne from it.
45	17	Exactly a week ago I got this new foundation so maybe I got the acne from that.
45	18	Going to ask my Dr for acne meds cause of it.
45	19	It also helped with my acne.
45	20	It also cleared up my acne I had before going on this birth control.
45	21	Otherwise, it cleared up my acne, lessened my symptoms from my period, and my period is perfectly regulated and only last about 4 days.
45	22	This patch didn't make me depressed (like the pill does), I lost acne quickly, and my hair lessened in growth.
45	23	I also got more acne but now that I'm at the end of 3 months it seems like its gone away.
45	24	My acne cleared up, and my breasts have grown a bit.
45	25	My acne has gotten worse.
45	26	Weight, acne, and sex drive did not seem to be impacted.
45	27	It also really helped clear up the mild-moderate acne that I had previously struggled with.
45	28	No itching, no baby, no huge detrimental side effects except for that I increased a cup size, acne is mild/did not change on patch, no more spotting in between periods, and no mood swings.
45	29	I really like the patch because it cleared up my moderate teenage hormonal acne.
45	30	My biggest complaint would be the weight gain and the acne.
45	31	The pill didn't really help, I always had a lot of breakthrough bleeding, acne and migraines.
45	32	I have normal periods, no acne or headaches, and I'm so happy!
45	33	No mood swings, no acne, no weight-gain, controlled period, protects me from being pregnant, only changed once a week, same sex-drive, and increased a cup size!
45	34	I lose weight, no acne problems (I tried Mirena and had bad acne issues), and I'm not as moody.
45	35	Two things are getting to me though--nausea and a little acne.
45	36	I've never had any problems with acne before, and I'm noticing some (not a ridiculous amount, but still more than I'm used to) since I started the patch.
45	37	I had a lot of problems with those which I'm not facing with the patch (acne, extreme tiredness, moodiness, yeast infections, bacterial vaginitis, weight gain, etc).
45	38	My acne cleared up, it has helped me calm down emotionally, I sleep better, and while it puts my sex drive on overload for the first month, it all mellowed out by the second or third month.
45	39	I have had breast tenderness and slight acne, no weight gain and light period with slight cramping usually have terrible cramping on my period.
45	40	I have side effects: reduced sex drive, breast tenderness in week 3 and patch off week, mood swings and an increase in acne in week 3, and mild skin irritation at the application site.
45	41	The OPPOSITE of the reviews I read by others is I started breaking out and haven't experienced breaking out this badly.
45	42	Had few pimples which happens almost never to me.
45	43	Now my face is really bad, red blotchy gross cyst pimples.
45	44	I am accustomed to having a few breakouts here and there, however I've been getting huge cystic pimples.
45	45	I only break out maybe two pimples before my period now.
45	46	Less pimples.
45	47	Doctor proscribed this for my period (heavy flow and bad cramps) Started on a Wednesday afternoon and that night I already had stomach aches, nausea and an anxiety attack trying to sleep.
45	48	Before it they used to be long and heavy, with a lot of cramps, now they last 3-4 days max with only 1-2 days of regular bleeding and the rest is light.
45	49	I only get 1 day of cramps (the heaviest day) and I get sensitive (not sore) and heavy boobs before my period comes.
45	50	It's way easier then taking a pill everyday and for me I can't take pills so the patch was a bonus for me but  I do have really bad cramps on it but I love how  it starts the same time every month and it makes my life a whole lot easier I would totally  recommend  it!
45	51	My experience is mixed it was good to start with no problems but as time went on I got loads of bad side effects and when I tried to come of it I had really heavy periods for over a month then I had to go back on it again now I'm coming off for the second time it is very very painful with the cramps and sickness to the point I can't keep still for too long and it takes a while for your periods and your fertility to come back
45	52	I still have cramps the first 2 days but advil helps that.
45	53	I had pretty bad side effects from the pill; headaches, bad cramps on my period, my period was never consistent and I was always spotting between periods.
45	54	Also I had bad cramps and breakthrough bleeding.
45	55	I've been trying this patch for about 3 weeks now and the cramps are unbearable I feel like I need to take midol everyday it's so bad feels like period cramps, I feel so nauseous that I want to throw up and my boobs are terribly SORE not to mention it has caused me to have a horrible yeast infection that I've treated twice in 2 weeks and it just won't subside!
45	56	I just started the patch 2 weeks ago & About 4 days ago I started getting unbearable cramps, that last about 5 minutes, every 20 minutes or so.
45	57	I finally took it off & The cramps stopped about an hour later.
45	58	Plus, the menstrual cramps were much stronger and my period lasted longer than usual.
45	59	I have cramps now and get daily headaches..
45	60	I still have my same number of menstrual days which is 6, I've never had cramps.
45	61	The pill gave me aura migraines and mood swings and my period wasn't any better, in fact my cramps got worse, bleeding was still the same.
45	62	I have very light cramps when its time for my period and my flow is 10 times less than it was.
45	63	Good-bye irregular cycle,cramps,pain, heavy flow and miserable period.. Hello to a happy me.
45	64	My periods seem to be less heavy and my cramps are completely gone too -I never had bad ones before, tho-.
45	65	I say this because my period has been horrible it has been intensified I have horrible cramps my back my stomach hurts everyday.
45	66	I'm moody all the time my back and stomach hurts I get horrible cramps and the list goes on.
45	67	The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control.
45	68	I started the patch a month ago I am still bleeding non stop really bad cramps , started having bad mood swings and it makes me wanna eat all day.
45	69	I used to get the worst cramps , now i get a little bit on the first day.
45	70	no mood swings no headaches no cramps shorter periods I love it but it doesnt stick good and it itches.
45	71	I haven't experienced cramps, nausea or headaches and didn't before I used birth control.
45	72	Experienced nausea, breast tenderness around time of period, & cramps that decreased greatly now that I'm used to it.
45	73	I get more emotional, I get mood swings, cramps, headaches, I bloat, I basically get all the the side effects, but they are not severe.
45	74	The worst symptom was cramps when I was not on my period at random times.
45	75	Also, my cramps are horrid right now but i think this is a very effective contraceptive.
45	76	When I first started using it,  I had some cramps but that may just have been because of my period although the cramps were worse where I had placed the patch.
45	77	The first day was AWFUL, my cramps were so bad I couldn't sit through a meeting with my professor and he told me not to go to class.
45	78	On the 4th week (off patch) I got my period, cramps and all, and by this point I thought the bleeding would never end!
45	79	I place the patch on my butt-cheek and I would say the very first time I put it on I automatically started feeling cramps on my tailbone and I have also noticed that my hands are super dry like extremely dry now and I got a few rash on my hands as well.
45	80	My doctor put me on the patch because I have terrible cramps during my period and usually develop ovarian cysts that are very painful a few days before my period starts.
45	81	My period, which usually lasts three days and is very light, lasted eight days and I had horrible cramps.
45	82	I'll admit that I've had pretty bad cramps and extreme changes in my mood when my period comes.
45	83	I have cramps from time to time, but since the patch I do not experience any period pains.
45	84	Before the patch I had no cramps signaling my menstruation but now I get minor cramps the week before with a little back pain.
45	85	Also, I have less period cramps than before (although my pre-patch period cramps were never really anything to complain about).
45	86	I had cramps during my week of the patch but I didn't mind.
45	87	I rather have cramps than having my period for an entire month.
45	88	Sometimes really bad cramps the first couple of days and maybe a headache or two.
45	89	I have some negative physical side-effects at first (cramps increased and my skin tends to get somewhat irritated under the patch, although less and less as time goes on) but there are no emotional side effects for me, which was a big plus.
45	90	The cramps were more frequent than the bleeding, but just as annoying.
45	91	I was on the Ortho Evra patch for a couple years and after the first 3 months of your body adjusting to it, (which you are forewarned about) just regular side effects, mood swings, regular cramps (when your time is almost near) and I believe it gave me a high sex drive.
45	92	My first month using the patch I experienced cramping and had my period for about 2 weeks straight.
45	93	The only side effects I have experienced are my breasts have grown slightly and become slightly tender before I get my period and I have a little bit more cramping when on my period.
45	94	Made me bleed more heavily, horrific cramping.
45	95	Terrible experience bad cramping, nausea, terrible mood swings at home and work my co-workers and kids are wondering whats going on.
45	96	I did experience cramping and terrible moods.
45	97	This time around I experienced horrible break outs that just started to subside, bad cramping, depressive moods (complete loss of control oved my emotions), irritability and heavy periods.
45	98	I found that I had some cramping and felt nauseous the first month but other then that everything was fine.
45	99	I've had unprotected sex during the patch free week since I am supposed to be protected from pregnancy according to instructions as long as I remember to apply the patch on time(every Sunday) I did experience a little nausea , head aches and a bit cramping but nothing too serious like other reviews.
45	100	My period is lighter and with no heavy cramping!
45	101	Lots of muscle cramping wherever the site was at.
45	102	I was on Depo for a year and experienced heavy cramping and bleeding the entire time.
45	103	Anyway I haven't had my period yet since I've been on it for only a week but I haven't experienced any headaches, mood swings & cramping which is great.
45	104	The first two months I did have random cramping and sore breasts but It was manageable and did not really bother me.
45	105	I am very moody, and have breast tenderness during period, but I knew exactly the day I would get my period and when I would be done, it was always light and cramping was minimal.
45	106	Also I have had on going cramping through my entire cycle.
45	107	I had a very small amount of cramping for a few hours, and that was it.
45	108	May have had a pimple or two in the first months, short nausea with the very first application, and heavier periods with additional but slight cramping.
45	109	I'm on my patch off week and I'm having awful cramping.
45	110	The only thing its changed is some months my period is very light and I have less cramping.
45	111	Also, sometimes, even when I'm not near my period, I will experience very mild cramping.
45	112	I only get cramping but its only right about the time I'm going to get my period.
45	113	My breasts were tender but I got used to it, and I love how light my cramping and periods are.
45	114	I originally started off with the ring which resulted in non-stop crying, non-stop cramping and constant breakthrough bleeding.
45	115	I used it continuously (with no off week) because I had really bad headaches during my period week and loved it at first, until about 6 months later and I started have a lot of horrible cramping and breakthrough bleeding.
45	116	I been on evra patch for a year now, no specific mood swings no spotting, normal periods as 7 days, period only starts on 3rd day after removing patch and overlap by 3 days!
45	117	I never stopped bleeding since my period (spotting) and I hope it stops because I cannot have sex if I'm bleeding, it makes me very uncomfortable.Hopefully it will stop once my period comes again.
45	118	The only downsides are that I had fairly heavy spotting for almost 3 weeks after my period but I haven't experienced any spotting since.
45	119	I've been on the patch for 2 months now, and I love it, the only downside to the pill it my periods have became more heavier and I have spotting in between by periods!
45	120	The only issue is now, after 6 years of it, I'm starting to get some spotting.
45	121	I read up on it beforehand and the reviews were playing on my mind but I've had NO sickness, NO headaches and NO spotting which has been great!
45	122	There are however some side effects I didn't know about, spotting in between periods, feeling nausea , headaches , etc.
45	123	The first month I had spotting for about 2 weeks after my period, but it vanished completely and didn't have any spotting since.
45	124	The only plus side  is that my breasts have grown a full cup size and no spotting during the month.
45	125	Side effects are mainly headache and a big appetite however no weight gain, no breakouts and some spotting in between.
45	126	I have spotting all the time, pretty heavy.
45	127	For the first time last week the spotting was really heavy, I'm switching back to brand name.
45	128	At first everything was perfect, I had some spotting here and there but nothing major.
45	129	I had spotting which is normal but it is annoying I just suggest using pantyliners
45	130	Only have to worry about it once a week, haven't had any side effects not even bleeding or spotting, get to have my regular period, and is basically so convenient.
45	131	I haven't had the best experience with it to begin with as I have heavy spotting after every patch change which is VERY annoying.
45	132	The second month, however, I experienced mild itching around the patch, extreme mood swing during the "off period", and heavy spotting for 4 weeks while wearing the patch.
45	133	My period was extended and lasted 2 weeks straight then I had a lot of spotting.
45	134	The thing that's changed is I had spotting instead of a full period.
45	135	Although I didn't have serious side effects, I did experience spotting every single day while on this.
45	136	No spotting, no sickness, however I did start getting numbness in my left arm but I did ignore it and irritations on patch site.
45	137	I have tried at least 8 kinds of oral contraceptive and went from feeling severe anxiety, spotting, nauseous, etc.
45	138	My sex drive is back with flying colors, no mood swings, no spotting.
45	139	As soon as could I switched back to the patch, now I'm back to my normal weight and no more spotting.
45	140	I am currently on day 5 of the patch and have had very very light spotting, but have been an emotional wreck all day.
45	141	Before going on the Patch, my periods would last 10 to 11 days (3 days of heavy to moderate bleeding, then spotting for 7 to 8 days).
45	142	Thanks to Ortho Evra, my periods are now only 6 days (3 days of heavy to moderate bleeding, then 3 days of spotting).
45	143	So far I haven't gained weight, or  had hair loss, spotting, or any of that.
45	144	I've been using Ortho Evra for about 3 years and have had some occasional breast tenderness and really occasional spotting.
45	145	All I've experienced were slight skin irritation (where patch was placed) and spotting.
45	146	I even put it in a spot that the skin doesn't stretch and move as much, it didnt help at all.
45	147	The part where the patch use to be was extremely itchy and there was a rash/bumps (no I did not shave my butt) or spot where I placed the patch.
45	148	Your bum would probably be the bet spot because the patch easily gets stuck on your jeans, shirt, bra, and will come off if you don't notice in time!
45	149	The best way to get rid of the outline is to just move the patch to another spot and let the previous spot clear up.
45	150	The first month was terrible, I had my regular period but I spotted all month long but then I got my next period and so far I haven't spotted since my period.
45	151	I rapidly gained almost 25 pounds and spotted the whole time!
45	152	Woke up Sunday feeling okay but around 11pm the nausea came back, I had a headache and my saliva was really thick.
45	153	The first couple of days on week one I have a low grade headache but nothing tylenol cant fix.
45	154	And also a massive headache that advil won't get rid off.
45	155	The only down side I have is that when I put on a new patch after my period I get really nauseated and a bad headache for a few hours but this started about 3 months ago and the other downside is that when I exercise and take hot showers it seems to make the patch slip off.
45	156	I'm 21 years old, and have been on the patch for 2 years now, in the beginning, I wasn't nauseous or anything, but in last couple of months, nausea and headache have gotten really bad.
45	157	I started it Wednesday night and by Evening of Thursday I had a headache and felt completely drained at work to the point where I had to ask my manager if I could be sent home.
45	158	I haven't really had any side effects except a little bit of a headache every now and then, but I don't know if that even has anything to do with the patch because I have a problem staying hydrated.
45	159	I had a slight headache first day of application but none since.
45	160	I read the reviews on here and was expecting a horrible headache the first day I put it on but I didn't feel any different at all.
45	161	I tried Ortho Evra patch for one day and instantly the patch was extremely itchy, I had a continuous headache within hours of the medication, I felt nauseous, and a little achy.
45	162	I also had a weird headache and taste in my mouth all month.
45	163	I was only on the patch for two weeks and while I love the easy use of switching from one patch to another only once a week, I had a terrible headache for the first patch and the second one I had a horrible migraine that ended with me in the emergency room.
45	164	I've been on the ortho evra for 2 weeks I've noticed that my boobs are getting very sore and I get headaches every now and then and I've gained weight , but I haven't bled since I've had the patch on I will up date as I notice anything else.
45	165	From the beginning of taking these I had those headaches (progressively worsening...) and it worried me a lot.
45	166	Your body will go through changes (nausea, sweats, headaches), but good luck finding a method that will leave you symptom free.
45	167	The patch I notice i am very tired and bitchy with headaches and nausea.
45	168	At the end I had unexplained muscle and joint pain, chronic headaches, none stop for 1 month straight at one point, and migraines 3-4 times a week.
45	169	When I'm on my period week I do experience more headaches but I take use the patches for 3 months straight so I only have a period every 3 months.
45	170	I have tried the pill and was having the worst headaches of my life and I was already on the lowest dosage.
45	171	I have finished my fist month and have experienced no weight gain, mood swings, depression or headaches.
45	172	I had some mood swings and terrible headaches, but I decided to be brave and just give it a try since it was my very first birth control, and after 4 weeks all the symptoms went away....
45	173	I honestly couldn't tell if it was working the first couple of months because I had no side effects like nausea or headaches.
45	174	The first 3 months I experienced some of the side effects: headaches, nausea, sore breast, emotional as hell.
45	175	On the negative side I get constant headaches, nausea, and vomiting and it is hard to sleep.
45	176	And my headaches were super bad on the no patch week.
45	177	The downside of it for me were the headaches.
45	178	I got terrible headaches from it.
45	179	The first 3 month sucked between headaches, nausea, being moody, and tired.
45	180	No nausea, no headaches, and my breasts got bigger.
45	181	I've had some headaches but nothing too bad.
45	182	And tiredness and slight headaches, but other then that, I'm loving it so far.
45	183	I put this on at 7pm and by midnight I had terrible headaches to the point I couldn't lift my neck or even talk because my teeth hurt.
45	184	At first I had bad headaches, or the first day I started the patch I was so sick to my stomach, I was not on any type of birth control for a couple of months and developed an ovarian cyst.
45	185	I've had a few bad headaches recently, but every once in a while my whole life I've gotten bad headaches.
45	186	I've found that since starting it, my skin has been better, I don't get headaches, my sex drive is normal, no weight gain, and not as moody!
45	187	The very first week of starting the patch, I was very nauseous, had some diarrhea, and very bad headaches (however I think this would be the case with most methods).
45	188	I had rashes wherever I put it, skin discoloration, constant yeast infections (no matter the placement), headaches, nausea, it kept coming off, bloating.
45	189	I have had headaches so bad they make me want to cry 24/7.
45	190	The last month I've had extreme anxiety, chest pain, headaches, nervousness, shaking...the works.
45	191	I have had some headaches here and there, as well as nausea which when I chew some gum it goes away in no time, and also some moodiness not a big deal though.
45	192	My wife was on continuous patches and she has breakthrough bleeding 365 days a year, nausea, throwing up, headaches, lower sex drive and extreme pain in her stomach which had her wake up in her sleep and crying out in pain especially during her period when not doing the 4th week.
45	193	I took a whole week off work because of a migraine.
45	194	It made me so sick I had migraine everyday and was nausea all the time.
45	195	I now only use one pad everytime I change, No migraine, no nausea, no mood swings, no weight gain and my skin looks better than ever.
45	196	The only issue I seem to have is that when I take it off, the day I start my period I nearly always get a major migraine, but that could also be linked to my period.
45	197	I had a bad migraine which lasted for 3 days.
45	198	When I was on migraine medication that worked well, Ortho Evra did not cause a problem.
45	199	Since my migraine medication has stopped working effectively, it seems that Ortho Evra increases my likelihood of a migraine during week 3.
45	200	I've never suffered migraines before I'm literally lying here with a cold cloth on my head, left arm is sore, forgetfulness can't remember anything, bladder is going haywire feeling exhausted I'm actually taking vitamins my Gyn told me my body has to get use to the medicine.
45	201	The patch seems to be working okay so far, I am experiencing nausea and migraines but I just hope it passes soon as this is my first week on the patch itself.
45	202	I lost my sex drive, I gained almost thirty pounds in five months, my moods were horrid, and constant migraines.
45	203	I have a history of migraines with aura.
45	204	It hasn't decreased my sex drive but it has decreased the amount of wetness down there during sex.
45	205	I have such a high sex drive, it doesn't give me mood swings or make me weight gain.
45	206	I've always had a crazy high sex drive and that didn't change.
45	207	I have previously tried the pill and I broke out like crazy and sex drive went down and I was really moody.
45	208	Other than that, no mood swings, no decrease in sex drive, no nausea/headaches/breast pain/etc.
45	209	Also with the patch my sex drive increased :) I would definately recommend it
45	210	I was on the Nuva Ring before the patch and It was working for me just fine but my sex drive was non existent.
45	211	My only complaints is the residue from the patch breast tenderness (although I did go up a size and my sex drive went way up).
45	212	I have used the Ortho Evra patch 2 years ago and I loved it, did not fall pregnant and had no side effects, but I went back to using it again six(6) months ago, my sex drive has drastically dropped and suffering from vaginal dryness for the past 3 months.
45	213	Sex drive is fine, first month only is bad side effects (moody, moody, moody).
45	214	It gave me an amazing sex drive.
45	215	I haven't really had the increased sex drive like a lot of women mention but I definitely feel as though my mood has evened out and I'm less "high and low" like I used to be.
45	216	So far, day 1, I got no symptoms but an increase in sex drive and I wanted to eat everything in my house.
45	217	And my sex drive is great!
45	218	The only thing is that I did lose my sex drive.
45	219	Sex drive has increased.
45	220	I forget it's even on me and my sex drive is still beyond great!
45	221	I have a lot of sex drive.
45	222	I'm on my second patch and already my sex drive is returning, I'm dropping some of that weight I gained, and my breasts are growing (they aren't even tender).
45	223	Other than that, I have absolutely no sex drive- but I haven't had a sex drive since I had my son two years ago.
45	224	My breast increased in size, my butt did too, my weight is stable and my sex drive is amazing!
45	225	My sex drive has went up.
45	226	After that, my skin cleared up, my breasts grew a whole size bigger, my anxiety got better, and my sex drive is insanely active.
45	227	As far as side effects: no depression, few mood swings, and a high sex drive.
45	228	My sex drive dropped for a time but has returned to normal and I have no problems there.
45	229	I haven't had any bad side effects, only very good ones like growing more than a full cup size and having a high sex drive.
45	230	I felt sick all of the time, was too moody and just wanted to be alone, my sex drive plumeted and everything felt horrible.
45	231	My sex drive has increased but that is probably due to the fact that I feel so well protected when I am on the patch.
45	232	My sex drive is high and my breast got a little larger.
45	233	The one thing I did notice after switching to the pill was a big plummet in my sex drive.
45	234	I miss the high sex drive on the patch.
45	235	Sex drive has decreased, and breast tenderness has occurred over weeks 2 and 3, but nothing too bad.
45	236	I've had very few issues with it... no weight gain, no moodiness, no stale sex drive.
45	237	Unlike the last person, my sex drive was low while using it.
45	238	I've been off of it for about 5 months and my sex drive plummeted dramatically.
45	239	My libido is down to nothing.
45	240	Since I've started the patch I've had an increase in libido like all the time .
45	241	At first It decreased my libido but that subsided.
45	242	I was feeling sick but not being able to puke, horrible loss of balance  and vertigo (full wack with eyeballs movement), weight gain (but I blamed that on the fact that I stopped running due to muscle pain and balance probs).
45	243	No weight gain.
45	244	Needless to say I've noticed some weight gain!!!!!
45	245	Once you get through that yucky part, you'll notice weight gain and also your breasts will get larger and tender.
45	246	No weight gain so far I will update later !
45	247	I had not had to many issues aside from i weight gain and it coming off before my week was up due to excess water.
45	248	Other than that I love the patch since I've worn it I haven't had weight gain but my boobs have went up a whole cup size so no more pretty bras .
45	249	No weight gain, nothing.
45	250	I do not have extreme mood swings or weight gain either.
45	251	No weight gain, doesn't fall off through shower/exercise, & if you forget to put a new patch on your patch change day you are still protected for I believe 3 days, after that use back up & start new patch change day on the day you remembered to put it on.
45	252	I tried nuvaring with no success (unfortunately it would move around too much and be quite uncomfortable), and the shot for 6 months (which made me horribly depressed, and was the first birth control to cause weight gain for me).
45	253	My mood was normal and I had no weight gain.
45	254	So far no weight gain I don't think, a little itchiness at the site of application, but it seems to be working really well.
45	255	I have noticed a slight weight gain, but I think that is from me consuming too much food when I have cravings.
45	256	I didn't notice any weight gain while I was on the patch and my bust went up a cup size.
45	257	Overall, I would say this is a great option for those who are looking for the convenience of a once a week change and are comfortable with side effects of maybe some slight weight gain and bigger breasts.
45	258	I'm very young so I blame my 10 pounds of weight gain on my body changing over the years.
45	259	No weight gain, moodiness or other issues.
45	260	I have been on the patch for about 2 years now, it is really good and simple to use, no weight gain no throwing up.
45	261	Since this is the first major weight gain I've had since I was 16.
45	262	After the crazy mood swings, lethargy, two-month period, social anxiety, and weight gain I experienced with the shot I was nervous about trying birth control again.
45	263	no forgetting to take it, no weight gain like many of my friends have had who are on the pill.
45	264	I had no side effects until I gained so much weight the last year I was 120 lbs and now I'm at 150 lbs .
45	265	I have never gained weight on the pill if anything I have lost few pounds.
45	266	I wore it for two years and I will admit my boobs grew a cup size and I gained about 10 lbs over time but my bf likes a little chubb so it was fine, lol.
45	267	Right away I noticed I gained water weight.
45	268	My boobs and stomach got a lot bigger gained the most weight.
45	269	My periods are shorter, I haven't gained any weight either.
45	270	Ever since, I've been super happy with it and I jut love it, I never gained a pound with it, never had mood swings with  it, never had a baby hahahar...
45	271	Within a week after using it I gained 10 pounds.
45	272	I have been on it for 2 years now and have gained around 30 pounds.
45	273	And I gained a bad cough that won't stop .
45	274	In the space of time I gained a lot of weight - I eat a lot, I pretty much want to eat all day.
45	275	Also I've gained weigh and can't seem to shift it and constantly obsessing with food.
45	276	I went a cup size bigger and i gained 5-10 pounds give or take..
45	277	I gained an additional 5 or so lbs when I switched over, but I think it's way worth it.
45	278	I have gained around 10 pounds and I cry and get emotional more now.
45	279	They are very tender though, and I have also gained weight.
45	280	On the patch I never gained weight from it.
45	281	I gained weight from the Depo shot.
45	282	On this birth control I lost 60 pounds, and I probably would have continued losing the weight I gained from the syndrome if I didn't stop.
45	283	I also fear that it will make me gain weight because I have gained 2-4 pounds since then.
45	284	I never had a problem with it, other than the fact that I've gained about 30lbs in the past 3 years.
45	285	I've gained more than 25 pounds!
45	286	Quickly gained 10 lbs in 3 months.
45	287	I have gained a small amount of weight, but my breasts have grown so I don't notice it much.
45	288	Haven't really gained weight with it.
45	289	I gained a few extra pounds, and I had mood swings like crazy!
45	290	With Ortho Evra I probably gained a few pounds but that comes with every birth control.
45	291	I never gained weight, I only went up a cup size.
45	292	I haven't gained any weight or had any side effects from it.
45	293	I have gained about 15lbs recently but that is probably due to my poor diet, or a combination of the two.
45	294	I've heard people have gained weight using Ortho Evra but I never had such issues.
45	295	For the first 6 months or so, I would experience nausea on the first day of a new box of patches and gained about ten pounds, but those are my only complaints.
45	296	I started the patch on Friday.I felt fine Friday night, I woke up Saturday morning and felt okay, as the day progressed, my nausea got worse.
45	297	I NEVER had nausea problems (kinda shocked by some reviews here).
45	298	Headache during most of the first week coupled with constant nausea.
45	299	The only thing that seems to make the nausea subside is eating!
45	300	Right away I noticed side effects of gaining weight and nausea.
45	301	I've been on it for almost a year and I haven't experienced any nausea or head aches.
45	302	That sometimes caused a sense of nausea, but I would highly recommend it.
45	303	I don't know which, but it gave me severe nausea every morning, almost as if I was pregnant.
45	304	I do have nausea in the mornings but nothing too terrible I just hope it ends soon.
45	305	I've only been on the patch for 6 days and the nausea is almost unbearable.
45	306	Constant nausea, tender breasts, emotional but all these things are bearable and seem to fade away after your body gets used to the patch.
45	307	On the 3rd day, nausea began and it has come in waves everyday since.
45	308	I had the most intense nausea, threw up, and then threw up again in the morning.
45	309	When I first applied the patch, I had a very small amount of nausea, nothing worth complaining about though.
45	310	Started the patch because I have incredibly low estrogen and I haven't had any nausea but a little fatigue.
45	311	I am VERY tired and sleep more than awake, get very dizzy, and just a little nausea.
45	312	I will say that each time I change the patch I do have a day of nausea.
45	313	Initial nausea: tolerable.
45	314	My main symptoms were bad nausea, painful soreness in my breasts and terrible mood swings.
45	315	I've not experience any vomiting, but nausea accompanies the loss of appetite.
45	316	Over this month on the patch though, I really haven't noticed any nausea or other negative side effects.
45	317	I got some nausea and vomiting, but I've always had a sensitive stomach so it had to do with a combination of things.
45	318	Then today, I felt nauseated all day and then started chest pains on my left side that went from tolerable to severe throughout the day.
45	319	And every time I put a new patch I get very nauseated, and extremely bloated.
45	320	The first week of the patch I felt pretty nauseated and I had loss of appetite, but after that I was fine.
45	321	The first month or so I started using it my body had to adjust so I was a little nauseated the first day of a new patch, but that went away.
45	322	Over the past 8 years I've been on 4 different combined pills, all of which eventually made me nauseous and caused me to vomit soon after taking them.
45	323	started the patch this month, am on 4th day of the patch free week and spent the last few days terrified that i might be pregnant - today I got my 'period'  aka BC withdrawal bleeding but have been nauseous all night.
45	324	I've been on the birth control patch for about seven months, and while I've never had issues with forgetting to change it, or it falling off (on the contrary it HURTS when I have to rip them off after a week) I have noticed in the last couple months that on my patch change day I become very light headed and nauseous and usually end up throwing up multiple times over the course of 4-8 hours.
45	325	I generally feel nauseous, or just unwell for the next three days after as well.
45	326	The only downside to it is that I get nauseous for a day or two on the 1st week after the no patch week.
45	327	The smell of things make me nauseous I'm very moody I'm always sad or upset - it's kinda ridiculous because I wish someone had informed me about this.
45	328	The patch ... i get a bad stomach ache and nauseous when i put a new one on .
45	329	I feel like I'm starving ever since I been on the patch I feel nauseous everyday.
45	330	The only thing I truly dislike about it is I will get really nauseous and throw up if I don't eat anything the night before I put a new one on and recently I'll have bloody discharge.
45	331	I just started the patch today and I felt so nauseous from it being on my abdomen that I had to move it to my arm.
45	332	But every month I would get so nauseous after putting a new patch on after my period that I'd need to sit back and close my eyes for awhile.
45	333	On the first full day of using the patch I was violently sick and felt nauseous for the morning but that was it.
45	334	I only felt nauseous one time.
45	335	I remember the first 2 patches I ever put on made me a bit nauseous, but now I put it on with no complaints whatsoever.
45	336	I tried the pill and that made me very nauseous so I decided to give Ortho Evra a try and it was the best decision I've ever made!
45	337	I felt nauseous for about a week but it was intermittent and went away.
45	338	Didn't like it because it made me nauseous all the time.
45	339	I feel nauseous every once in awhile but that may be contributed to other things and it subsides relatively quickly.
45	340	I am nauseous, my breasts are swollen and sore, and I am retaining water.
45	341	The pill made me too nauseous and I forgot to take it all too often.
45	342	In the beginning I did feel a little nauseous but that went away in no time.
45	343	Also, it seems like on my change day, I get extremely nauseous.
45	344	The first day of a new patch, I'm always extremely tired and a bit nauseous as well.
45	345	I also have been nauseous almost every single day after being on it for a week.
45	346	Sometimes, on my Patch change days in September and October, I would feel a little bit nauseous or lightheaded, but I think this may have been partially or completely psychological.
45	347	But I can say that lately I have been quite depressed and nauseous.
45	348	The first month I didn't have much of an appetite and often felt nauseous, but now that my body has adjusted I only have a few minimal side effects.
45	349	I was off for about a year since those made me get incredibly nauseous all the time.
45	350	After having awful side effects from oral contraceptive pills, and after trying Ortho Cyclen again as part of my IVF protocol (It made me so dizzy and nauseous I woke up in the middle of the night vomiting), my reproductive endocrinologist switched me to the Ortho Evra patch.
45	351	First few days on the patch can't be classed as the nicest as I felt dizzy and vomited few times however that stops relatively quickly.
45	352	so dizzy I can't walk.
45	353	When I got back up, I was so dizzy I couldn't walk straight.
45	354	I can't relate to the mood swings at all .
45	355	I'll admit I would have PMS-like mood swings each time I changed the patch but I never had shakes or sweating.
45	356	I've been using the patch for about 6 months now because it's more  convenient, my periods are regulated which is good but the bad part is I have terrible mood swings with the patch espically the first couple days of a new one, I took a month break from it just to see if it still happened but I was fine and as soon as I started using the patch again back to my grumpy, moody self.
45	357	Mood swings aren't that bad either.
45	358	I took birth control pills for 3 years and recently had my Implanon removed after a year and a half with horrible, heavy periods and terrible mood swings.
45	359	Other than that, its pretty good, no pregnancy, no dryness, no mood swings.
45	360	The first month I experienced really emotional mood swings and a really heavy, long period.
45	361	Since then I have actually calmed down with mood swings and a lot less snappy!
45	362	Then all of a sudden I had these terrible mood swings.
45	363	I have sudden and fierce mood swings and am more emotional than I was when I was pregnant.
45	364	I'm trying to see how I am without the patch due to fatigue and mood swings.
45	365	No mood swings and very increased drive.
45	366	The first month was horrible I had the worst mood swings and I cried so much.
45	367	I've had a few mood swings but once again it could be contributed to other things.
45	368	I originally took the pill, but the mood swings were too intense for me.
45	369	I have not experienced any mood swings on the patch.
45	370	I have recently noticed some mood swings, and random break downs.
45	371	I haven't noticed any mood swings or any other side effects thankfully.
45	372	I had noticed a bit of mood swings, and my breasts grew as well (bonus).
45	373	I had the worst mood swings ever.
45	374	Breakthrough bleeding and very severe mood swings after one year.
45	375	No real side effects except for slight mood change before my period is due.
45	376	Had slight temper before patch so only mood change was more emotional/sensitive lol.
45	377	I was really nervous trying it out because of some reviews.
45	378	I get nervous sometimes that I might get pregnant because I still don't understand the fact of putting a patch on and then having hormones enter your body...WEIRD.
45	379	If I could give this patch a 0 rating I would , had the patch on for just over 24 hours and I started to feel sick then the next morning I was throwing up but nothing coming out because I hadn't eaten since last night , doctor said this would go usually after 3 months and I wasn't prepared to keep it on for that long and be feel sick everyday , it also made me very anxious and I'd only had it on for a little time , never again.
45	380	I suppose it may have gotten better, but I was irritable, over-sensitive, depressed, anxious and generally felt like I was going to come out of my skin.
45	381	From then to Friday had these same side effects and they seemed to switch intensities each day such as more anxiety on the 3rd day but the day before worse stomach aches.
45	382	Lately the anxiety problems are my biggest scare.
45	383	I haven't slept for 3 nights, even on 10MG of Melletonin and  my anxiety medication which normally knock me right out when I'm having a bad night.
45	384	Been on Evra Patch for about 8 months now started with no periods at all first 2 - 3 months  now it seems to be getting heavier and lasting alot longer also I get freaky paranoid and bad anxiety just before my break and after.
45	385	This doesn't help with my anxiety levels.
45	386	I have always suffered anxiety about remembering to take a pill, especially when breastfeeding and using the mini pill which needed to be taken at exactly the same time daily.
45	387	My first week of taking the patch it was annoying and I wanted to take it off but now I hate having that week off the patch because I noticed that whenever I have it off I'm very moody, tired, and have a lot of anxiety.
45	388	I was on the Depo shot for 2 years, at first it was fine, but in the last 6 months I became very depressed, my anxiety levels were through the roof.
45	389	While on it however, I experienced horrible anxiety and depression.
45	390	It made me feel bad because my doctor said of my family history of depression and anxiety that I inherited.
45	391	I thought I was having anxiety until I spoke to my doctor and found out my birth control was the problem.
45	392	I thought I had anxiety but not all the symptoms match.
45	393	I had two of the biggest anxiety attacks on this pill, after the second one I immediately took the patch off and felt better within hours.
45	394	The patch is amazing despite constant breast tenderness.
45	395	I have also noticed breast tenderness, but its mild and goes away quickly.
45	396	Other than the breast tenderness everything else is completely fine.
45	397	I have to say I have never been more emotional in my life, and the breast tenderness is crazy.
45	398	I also experience swollen tender breasts which is absolutely not fun.
45	399	Other then that the only side effects I've had are tender breasts and a red square rash where I put my patch but it does fade to a light red.
45	400	(been on it for 3 months) My only side effects are tender breasts an feeling hot often.
45	401	I have no side effects except for tender breasts.
45	402	Well basically when I first used it, it was great only have tender breasts felt a little sick but it went away.
45	403	My only complaint is skin irritation from time to time, and tender breasts.
45	404	So I got back on the patch and now it seems like I get a yeast infection each month.
45	405	Unfortunately I've been getting a lot of yeast infections recently so I'm going to try the Nuvaring to see if the Ortho patch is what's causing it (highly doubtful).
45	406	The only down is constant yeast infections seems like they started since I've been on patch because they never used to be a problem.
46	1	So, I was perimenopausal-heavy and irregular periods, painful ovulation, anxiety, mood swings, depression, acne, etc.
46	2	I also have acne on my back which I have never had before .
46	3	After 1 week of taking it I woke up in the middle of the night with excruciating cramps (I've never had an issue with bad cramping before), have had a breakout of cystic acne, horrible mood swings (sad for no reason), have lost my appetite, am gaining weight, have sore breasts and am very tired.
46	4	This pill was effective at preventing pregnancy, and luckily I did not experience weight gain or acne, but one thing I will say is that it gave me horrible mood swings.
46	5	My acne did get worse but that was also the side effect to the topical cream I use for it as well.
46	6	I have had constant side affects of awful acne, cramping, irregular periods, crazy mood swings, and my breasts are constantly sore.
46	7	At first it was the acne all around my eyes and forehead, and the abdominal pains constantly.
46	8	Sex drive kinda low but no acne.
46	9	I only get one for like 1-2 days now and my acne has also cleared up.
46	10	I also have noticed bad acne breakouts, I might reconsider this pill.
46	11	It also cleared my acne and I never had any pregnancy scare.
46	12	I️ thought my body would hate this because of all the bad reviews I’ve read but I’m on my second pack now and I️t has cleared up my acne and no weight gain.
46	13	During the first week I did have some nausea and spotting but it helped with my heavy flow and acne.
46	14	From the very beginning it made my acne horrible.
46	15	I normally never have acne except for the week of my period, and then it will only be like one or two Whitehead’s.
46	16	But the entire time I was on this pill, terrible terrible acne all over my face.
46	17	I’ve always had a small amount of acne, but once I started taytulla it seemed as if I got a new pimple daily.
46	18	I switched to ortho-tri-cyclen after two months on taytulla and my period is under control as well as my acne.
46	19	This pill is making me so miserable; I cry every single day, my hair falls out when I run my fingers through it, my skin is really oily and I'm getting acne which I've never had in my life.
46	20	I did notice that all of a sudden I have two giant cystic acne spots on my back now, super painful!
46	21	My period lasts between 2-4 days, my cramps are very light, I do not get any negative side effects like some people have mentioned, I get less acne during my ovulation period and my headaches have gone away.
46	22	I had clear skin before this pill and now I don’t even want to leave the house my acne is so bad.
46	23	I had beautiful skin and never had an acne problem until I went on mibelas.
46	24	About a month after starting mibelas I developed cystic acne that was not only painful but has left significant scarring on the sides of my face at 24 years old.
46	25	Immediately after stopping it, the acne stopped.
46	26	I haven't gained weight, I haven't gotten more acne, and my mood hasn't changed.
46	27	I was on this medication just as a birth control method not for acne.
46	28	I've had mild acne since I was 10 but never anything too serious.
46	29	I had weight gain, acne, was very moody/depressed, I hated to be touched in anyway, and I also had a decrease in sex drive.
46	30	I developed cystic acne within days - even on my legs which was a first for me.
46	31	I have not had cystic acne on my face in over 10 years.
46	32	In the first 10 days of taking it I broke out in severe acne that included cysts, I became so moody that it can only accurately be described as a bipolar roller coaster, and I started spotting.
46	33	No increases in cramps, PMS, acne.
46	34	For acne, I mild acne but my doctor said it would clear up my acne but I personally think it made it worse instead of clearing it up.
46	35	I had severe nausea and got  acne from it.
46	36	Between the 2 I do not have any bleeding, nor endo symptoms (mostly intestinal & ovarian when they're bad), nor any bad side effects - no tender breasts, decreased sex drive, acne breakouts, crazy mood swings, cramping, bloating, food cravings, weight gain, rage attacks (all of which I've experienced with other hormone regimens).
46	37	I've always had great skin (I've been told by many doctors) and after just 10 days I'm suffering from cystic acne, the likes of which I have never seen.
46	38	I experienced nausea, bleeding, acne, anxiety, depression, irritability, loss of focus and felt like I was losing it.
46	39	I got extremely painful cystic acne around my mouth, painful menstrual cramps, headaches, and I went from weighing 150 pounds to now 180 pounds.
46	40	But the only thing that sucks is I have back acne and I've never had that before, they're huge zits and super painful so iIwould like tips on how to calm those down!
46	41	It cleared my acne for a couple months but about 6 months into I had cystic acne all around my mouth and forehead.
46	42	The only positive out of it was that it cleared my acne for a short period of time.
46	43	Didn't experience any acne other than 1 or 2.
46	44	I've never had acne before in my life, and now after taking this for almost 2 months I have acne on my entire face, and also on my back.
46	45	It hasn't caused cramps, weight gain, spotting, nausea, mood swings, or acne for ME personally.
46	46	I'm naturally prone to mood swings and hormonal acne and I feel like it actually regulates both issues, although they're not gone altogether.
46	47	However, the acne is the worst painful ones I've ever experienced.
46	48	Large multiple deep cystic acne.
46	49	The ONLY side effects I have are going from 8 day heavy periods to no periods, no spotting ever, and clearing up the cystic acne I would get during ovulation and my period.
46	50	My acne has gone away and I have picked up a little weight gain that was much needed as I was only 107lbs.
46	51	It has helped my acne and overall skin.
46	52	I also noticed a huge decline in sex drive and acne increased a lot.
46	53	I get TERRIBLE headaches and nausea almost constantly, I've broken out in acne all over my face, I have been suffering with terrible depression/anxiety/lack of interest in anything, and fatigue.
46	54	I've only done a month & I've had bad mood swings, bad headaches, bad body acne I've never had before, super tender breasts, and vaginal discharge every day.
46	55	No significant changes in mood or (facial) acne... though this cycle I have started getting acne on my back and butt which I never have experienced before.
46	56	It did regulate my periods and controlled acne, but other than that my life sucked.
46	57	I had a wonderful experience with Gildess, but Blisovi on the other hand gave me horrible/painful acne, breast tenderness that got progressively worse, dryness, trouble sleeping, and yeast infections.
46	58	My acne has went away I have regular periods to the date I took my last pill.
46	59	I've also had an increase in acne.
46	60	I have NEVER had a problem with acne and this pill made my skin break out like no other.
46	61	I bled the entire first month I was on this pill (probably because I was suffering amenorrhea for almost 8 months), and I got some acne (I've never struggled with acne before, but this wasn't too serious).
46	62	The acne is still there, but it's not bad.
46	63	When I switched to this one the only side effect I had was weight gain but now on my sixth pack I'm starting to get really bad acne around my chin and forehead and my horrible menstrual cramps are back.
46	64	Severe acne, low sex drive, vaginal dryness, extreme nausea and vomiting at the start of each pack, turned me into a raging psycho most of the time (literally felt like a different person on this pill, it was amazing getting off this and feeling like a cloud of anger and anxiety had been lifted off my shoulders).
46	65	And about acne before I started this birth control I had blackheads , whitehead and I would get a few pimples it hasn't changed much some days I notice my face looks cleaner with less acne than others but I never really have had a lot of acne .
46	66	At first, my acne flared up more than usual.
46	67	I never get pimples or acne anymore and my periods are tolerable.
46	68	And I mean not one spot of acne compared to before when my skin was breaking out all the time.
46	69	I never had any issues with acne, but this BC pill made me break out not only on my face but other body parts.
46	70	I take this for my acne, which is almost completely disappeared.
46	71	I got extreme mood swings, horrid acne (my skin has always been clear), weight gain, and tender breasts.
46	72	As soon as I stopped taking it, the acne and hives went away.
46	73	As for a time frame, I took it for 3 days when the acne started.
46	74	Took another month for the acne to completely go away.
46	75	I took this pill for approximately 5 days and I completely broke out into acne like all over my body face, chest, back and arms... and I've never had acne in my life.
46	76	I got horrible fatigue, neck pain, and acne from this medication.
46	77	At almost 25 years old, I'm experiencing worse acne than I ever have before in my life.
46	78	I have stubborn acne in odd places (face, chest, even down there!)
46	79	My favorite thing is that my acne is gone!
46	80	I have moderate acne and I haven't noticed it making me breakout anymore than my regular.
46	81	I've suffered from cystic acne for years.
46	82	I still had terrible cramps, stomach bloating, and my acne actually seemed to get worse as the months went on.
46	83	Within a week of going on this pill, the left side of my face developed cystic acne.
46	84	It has also cleared my acne that I had so many issues with previously.
46	85	I have had acne but it's not the kind that is  filled with puss it's the hard ones that hurt and leave a scar even if you don't touch it.
46	86	I've never had an issue with acne unless it was my 'time of the month' with 1-2 'period pimples'.
46	87	My skin became acne prone as soon as I stopped taking Gildess, to the point where I started getting cystic acne, even with upping my skincare routine & rarely wearing makeup.
46	88	I was on Gildess (loved it, gained 10lbs, light periods, no acne) for 5 years until all of a sudden the pharmacy changed it to microgestin.
46	89	My acne has cleared up significantly, I've actually lost weight but my breast size went up by a cup size and my moods have evened out a lot.
46	90	It gave me acne, HORRIFIC mood swings.
46	91	I went on this birth control for two reasons : acne and protection from pregnancy.
46	92	Not to mention I had a very bad acne problem, that went away too.
46	93	It also caused my acne to get worse within the first week.
46	94	Now that I'm on my second dosage, my acne has cleared and I am waking up on time.
46	95	I would experience little cramps and acne for about 2 weeks.
46	96	The reason I gave it a 7 instead of a 10 is because I have been having some major acne around my chin and jaw as a side effect.
46	97	Even with washing my face using acne control products it hasn't seemed to help.
46	98	I didn't have any problems with acne, weight gain or heavy periods.
46	99	I didn't gain weight, have mood swings, breakthrough bleeding, low sex drive, but I did notice around my period time I would have 1 or 2 cyst like pimples pop up that took roughly 2 weeks to heal and sometimes left a scar which I'm not prone to acne and have a good skin regime.
46	100	Uggghh I haven't have acne in 3 yrs and as soon, as soon!
46	101	I have had no weight gain and only increases in acne when I am extremely stressed.
46	102	I had no acne, my periods were better.
46	103	on my 3rd month and the acne caused by this pill still havent gone away.
46	104	As a BC its great idk if its worth the acne tho.. my skin is so scarred.
46	105	This drug is actually prescribed to treat acne so i'm surprised to see a review saying it caused it.
46	106	My chin area broke out with horrible terrible acne and nothing is helping it to go away.
46	107	It helped with my acne but I'm a lot more paranoid about getting pregnant than I was on lolestrin.
46	108	I have never had a problem with acne and I woke up yesterday with 3 pimples on my chin and some on my back.
46	109	the only real negative side effect ive experienced is acne.
46	110	No acne either!
46	111	I was constantly having breakthrough bleeding, mood swings, horrible anxiety which I had never had before, and my acne had come back.
46	112	I was so happy and full of energy with in the first few days however I did notice a little bit of acne and soreness around my nipples the first few days.
46	113	As the days went by my acne got better and the soreness disappeared.
46	114	I also have extremely bad acne from this pill and I NEVER get a single pimple unless I am about to start my period then I maybe get 1 or 2.
46	115	I haven't had any crazy mood swings, no weird cravings, and my acne is actually clearing up.
46	116	I never gained weight, never struggled with acne, or had any other issues.
46	117	A little bit of spotting, a little moodiness, a little acne, but I've lost a few pounds and the bleeding is finally under control for the first time in over 20 years.
46	118	Acne break out terrible big yellow hard to squeeze bumps and I never ever had any acne.
46	119	My main concern when starting birth control was weight gain and acne, but I was able to maintain my weight and my skin has significantly cleared up.
46	120	I can say that in terms of excessive weight gain, acne, or mood swings, Loestrin didn't cause me to experience any of these, contrary to some of the posts that I've read on here.
46	121	I cannot recall the last time I experienced cramps, and I only ever have acne in places I touch my face.
46	122	I took Femcon for a total of 6 years it cleared up my acne and I lost weight while taking it.
46	123	My acne is much improved on it, I've actually lost weight in this time, I haven't had any spotting.
46	124	My experience on the pill is going okay I'm on my 3rd pack no bleeding, just spotted for a hour I get cramps when it's time for my period to come I notice I became more emotional lately I fee like crying a lot, when someone tells me something I get really sensitive, my boobs get sore and they have gone up in  cup size, I get acne  when it's time for my period but that's it, my hunger has been the same, when it's that time I crave fried foods.
46	125	For the first 3 months it worked but after the 4th and 5th month that had passed it had given horrible side effects such as very bad acne ( I never use to break out) and weight gain of 12 lbs within a month ( I use to be in a healthy weight.)
46	126	The first two there were no really bad side effects except some acne and heavy flow with nasty cramps that I was assured would go away by month three....ABSOLUTELY NOT.
46	127	I also never had a issue with acne.
46	128	I highly recommend that those who are prone to any sort of acne try a DIFFERENT brand of birth control.
46	129	Junel Fe, otherwise known as Microgestin, is a pill that will not usually make one's acne better, it will either stay the same OR make it worse.
46	130	With Junel Fe I began to get acne all over my face - my jaw, cheeks, forehead, and chin.
46	131	I went from almost perfect skin to having adult acne!
46	132	Seems like good skin on birth control isn't possible for everyone...Anyway, a high estrogen pill is probably better for acne.
46	133	I used to be on a different medicine for acne but once I started this pill i stopped taking the other medicine and now I have whiteheads everywhere, which is opposite from what i usually get.
46	134	Only 3 weeks in and cystic acne everywhere on chin and forehead   other breakouts.
46	135	Keep in mind I have never suffered from acne or breakouts before!!!
46	136	My acne has never ever been this bad.
46	137	This pill had so many side-effects that came very slowly for the 6 months I was on it, and acne started developing on my cheeks, my chin, and on my chest.
46	138	The acne was purple and really nasty.
46	139	I never had acne in my life before!
46	140	I've never had acne problems, and nothing got better or worse being on it.
46	141	Took it for a year and although I loved it in the begining (lost weight, no acne), after about 6 months I realized I was feeling sad, tired, with no energy or no sex drive at all.
46	142	For younger women who have issues with painful or heavy periods, acne, or who just need highly effective birth control, I highly recommend this pill.
46	143	This is the first pill that I've tried which I've liked being on; I've had no acne, my periods are more manageable with mood swings GREATLY reduced (a blessing).
46	144	It causes a lot of weight gain, acne, depression, bleeding, great tenderness, and mood swings.
46	145	The biggest issue is that is has CAUSED acne in places I've never had it before, most noticeably my neck.
46	146	Oh and lastly, my acne cleared up!
46	147	I suffered from acne since middle school, and it looks as if i never had a bump on my face.
46	148	(Unfortunately) and my  acne isn't as bad as it was.
46	149	I have back acne and occasional pimples on my face I didn't notice it did anything to make it better or worsen it.
46	150	I've been taking Necon 1/35 for almost 2 months now and so far I have experienced acne (which I've never had before), weight gain, Breast growth (I was already a double D Before), and crying spells.
46	151	It helped to clear up my acne and made my periods much lighter and shorter (from 7 days to only 2 or 3).
46	152	My acne is WAY worse.
46	153	It helped my back acne (which was really stubborn) but it didn't do much to my face acne.
46	154	I have cystic acne so I'm going to give Tri-Previfem a second shot.
46	155	A little acne around the time of the period, but that happened before I was on birth control.
46	156	Was hoping acne would go away but no such luck there...
46	157	I still have acne, most likely because I am still a teen.
46	158	As for mood swings I have none, no weight gain, my acne has lessened as well.
46	159	My severe cystic back acne is gone.
46	160	The downsides, I have tender breasts (not bad though), occasional nausea, and acne.
46	161	I've never had acne before, but it is something I am able to control and deal with easily.
46	162	So far no migraines and less acne.
46	163	I may switch back to the 1/20 if the acne doesn't get better.
46	164	It did that, but I also developed horrible acne on my face & back.
46	165	I have not experienced any odd side effects however I am a little disappointed it did not help with my back acne.
46	166	This cleared up my acne significantly I haven't had a breakout since I started.
46	167	The only down side was that my face broke out about halfway through my pill pack every month; not really terrible acne, just annoying pimples.
46	168	Light periods, no problems with acne, no cramps, not even mood swings nor drastic change in libido.
46	169	No weight gain and acne, my sex drive increased.
46	170	I've tried other birth control pills in the past with side effects like acne or headaches and didn't want any of that, I told my ob/gyn, just something comparable to Ortho TriCyclen Lo.
46	171	I was on Yasmin previously for 6 months and experienced a 20lb weight gain, mood swings, acne, the works.
46	172	Cleared up my acne slightly - I have cystic acne.
46	173	Switching to Yaz to see if that helps better with my acne.
46	174	But also, I've read other reviews and acne was a side effect of this specific type.
46	175	The only problem I am having now is acne.
46	176	I don't have a history of breaking out and started to notice my face become oily and breakouts appearing soon after I started the pack.
46	177	My periods were 2 weeks and my face was always breaking out...after 3 months I decided my body wasn't adjusting and switched to Taytulla and the change in my mood and appearance was almost immediate - my anxiety and depression no longer feel amplified, my skin has cleared up and I'm not constantly changing panty liners and tampons - my period was literally 2 days & so light I thought it was spotting at first.
46	178	Ever since taking this BC I have had headaches, extreme nausea, double vision, depression, anxiety, terrible cramps, and I got a yeast infection, which turned to a bacterial infection, I am breaking out like crazy.
46	179	It's been 8 months since I stopped and I'm still breaking out terribly.
46	180	Within first 2 weeks face started breaking out bad, mood changes, appetite change (constantly hungry),feet started swelling and then chest heaviness and palpations along with shortness of breath.
46	181	It made my skin very sensitive and I started breaking out in a rash towards the end of the first week.
46	182	I was also breaking out horribly all the time and had terrible nausea.
46	183	My face is constantly breaking out and I'm gaining a lot of weight.
46	184	I normally have very clear skin, but have noticed some breaking out along my cheekbones and jawline.
46	185	These pimples are massive!
46	186	I'm on my second week of this pill and no joke I got 40 new pimples from starting this pill!
46	187	Towards the last week of the active pills I get my regular period about to start pimples.
46	188	I am getting more tiny pustule pimples than I was, but I have also been eating a lot more junk lately.
46	189	I had HUNDREDS of pimples the day after starting.
46	190	most of them have cleared but now instead of a bunch of tiny red pimples, I get big painful cyctic ones.
46	191	I get maybe 3 or 4 pimples a year and my skin is clear besides some mild oily tzone/chin.
46	192	Always had pimples under my chin and blackheads.
46	193	Month three has been the worst.....I break out all the time when I never used to get pimples, I feel nauseous and pukey all day every day, no food sounds or tastes good, I have back pain and lower abdominal pain, I'm bloated and swollen, and I've gained almost 8 pounds!!!
46	194	Not just my jawline or near my face, big cystic pimples on my neck and throat which are impossible to cover up!!
46	195	I noticed even less cramping, a less heavy period, HOWEVER, I did get a few cystic nodular pimples around my mouth.
46	196	It doesn’t give me tons of little zits, but a couple large ones that take over my face that I have never really gotten before.
46	197	I would get up to 7 painful, embarrassing cystic lumps at a time and tons of zits that were oddly prone to leaving scars.
46	198	The periods never stopped and the cramps are horrible.
46	199	I’m only staying on it for now because no hair loss, no cramps, no headache.
46	200	I used to have unbearably painful cramps and a super heavy flow when I got my periods, and taytulla has completely eliminated that for me.
46	201	I hardly ever get cramps anymore (prior to birth control, my cramps and bleeding were SEVERE to the point of blackout/vagal response).
46	202	My cramps have been even worse to the point where I have to scream into my pillow.
46	203	I never had bad cramps or long periods before I took the pill, and this pill has kept it that way.
46	204	I used to have heavy periods, terrible cramps and headaches, and my periods were super long.
46	205	I now have super consistent 3-4 LIGHT periods, no cramps or headaches.
46	206	I had PMS food cravings, headache, cramps, and mood swings with uncontrollable crying that were off the charts and worse than my "normal PMS" symptoms.
46	207	I gained 7 pounds, and my boobs got bigger, which I expected, but I’ve been bleeding for over 20 days, I had a migraine experience that led me throw up breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and waves of cramps that would come and go.
46	208	But for the first 2 weeks I was on it I was so sick- waking up at night drenched in sweat, lower back pain, cramps, no appetite, my face broke out, you name it... Now I only have cramps off and on, bloated, my period is lighter but I have been depressed for at least 2 moonth my appetite goes from nothing at all to wanting to eat everything.
46	209	The first few months I was taking this I noticed my periods were incredibly heavy and my cramps were debilitating.
46	210	Started out great then started with very sharp pains, was on bed rest and almost rushed to the ER.... no sign of my period but I sure feel it coming because he pain, bloating, cramps, acid reflux, sickness, PMS, mood swings, anger and depression which WON'T STOP.
46	211	I get ankle swelling, gained 15 lbs, very bad headaches at least 3/4 times a week, cramps, extreme mood swings, depression to the point where I didn't want to leave my house, and got a very heavy period every other week lasting 3-4 days
46	212	I have been on this for 2.5 months now and before this I had the paraguard and I had terrible periods and I would get terrible cramps anytime I was bloated and now I don't have any of those side effects and I am feeling pretty much like myself on this pill.
46	213	The first month I was extremely nauseous and had terrible cramps but they went away.
46	214	I was on Cyclafem for about three years and started having horrible cramps outside of the week of my period.
46	215	Worst parts of this were feeling nauseous for the first three days I was on it (nausea went away after), one pimple, and cramps the first day of my period.
46	216	In just the first month, I suffered anxiety, mood swings, depression, nausea, cramps, and a huge cyst on the side of my head.
46	217	My headaches are more severe, I gained weight with no change in my diet, my legs ache almost all the time, anxiety is worse I am waking up in the night with anxiety, mood swings and short temper plus when on minastrin I never got my period now I get it and the cramps are horrible.
46	218	Its back to how heavy it was prior to the pills, and the cramps are back full force.
46	219	I was given this prescription to help with menstrual cramps it has helped but  I don't like the way its made me feel.
46	220	I had a smooth transition from Minastrin to Taytulla, meaning no break through bleeding, but my actual periods have been a lot heavier and my cramps a lot worse on Taytulla.
46	221	On a pain scale from 1-10, I would say I was at a 10; when I had cramps I would have to leave school for at least a day or two, and was bedridden and had no appetite.
46	222	I've had a lot of break through bleeding, cramps all the time and overall just feel horrible.
46	223	Period wise my periods r shorter and cramps aren't as bad but not none existent.
46	224	The only difference I've noticed is that my breast are slightly more tender when my cycle is about to start but I'll rather deal with that than the heavy flow and cramps that had me bedridden for a whole week.
46	225	Also experienced cramps the week before and of my period, as well as a super heavy period which I never had prior to being put on birth control, and where I bled through numerous tampons and clothes.
46	226	I have now been on it for almost 4 months and would have extreme headaches, cramps, and very heavy and long periods.
46	227	The first 4 four months were okay I didn't notice any bad side effects except for minor cramps everyday.
46	228	I was bleeding heavy for at least 5 days and started feeling cramps, even pains in between was like my period was coming early.
46	229	My experience on this for my first period the first month was terrible because the cramps were killer.
46	230	But other than that the pill made my period very light and few to no cramps.
46	231	Once I got my period, I experienced horrid and uncomfortable cramps one of the first days, that I had to call out of work for being sick (I was crawling, crying and threw up once).
46	232	Constant pain in ovaries and abdomen, sharp cramps at random times in my cycle, nauseated, bloated, couldn't wear my contacts for a month straight due to eye irritation, chest pains, so so so moody and emotional for NO REASON.
46	233	I have been on Junel Fe 24 for about 2 weeks after getting my Paragard IUD removed due to terrible, debilitating cramps (which I had never had before).
46	234	My periods controlled my life and made it so I couldn't function half the time due to cramps, nasuea, & fatigue.
46	235	I have very little if not no weight gain with this pill, no mouth ulcers like my last pill did, mild PMS, and no cramps.
46	236	My periods are very light only requiring a panty liner and experience no cramps.
46	237	I was doubled over at my desk with cramps and my period was very heavy.
46	238	I started using Ortho-Novum 7/7/7 again and I was back to light periods and no cramps.
46	239	Once and awhile my OBGYN would give me a sample of another brand that was new on the market only for me to have heavier periods and cramps.
46	240	It also extended my by 2 more days, gave me intense cramps, and increased my anxiety.
46	241	We are talking extreme anemia, constant nonstop heavy bleeding for months on end, fatigue, crippling cramps, weight gain and no sex drive.
46	242	I'm healthier than I've been in years, weight loss, glowing skin, thriving sex drive, no cramps or endless painful periods.
46	243	It did help with cramps and period pain but it had such an impact on my sex drive I cannot stand it.
46	244	I still get light cramping during my cycle and sometimes no cramps at all.
46	245	Extreme fatigue , extreme nausea, leg cramps, breast tenderness, ACNE, MOOD SWINGS, heart palpitations.
46	246	I also have severe period cramps and this does not help with them at all.
46	247	I don't remember having problems before but for 2 months I've had discolored discharge, now breakthrough bleeding and mild cramps.
46	248	My anxiety is through the roof (I'm not generally an anxious person), I'm super moody (I'm normally a happy person), I'm extremely bloated 24/7 (I look 6 months pregnant), my hair keeps falling out, I'm nauseous, I just got over my period a week ago and now I have breakthrough bleeding (heavy bleeding), I already have horrid period cramps from PCOS but these microgestin cramps are almost unbearable.
46	249	I still get my period during the placebo week but my cramps are way more manageable, and my period is super light and only last 2-3 days, when before it was 4-5 days and horrible horrible cramps.
46	250	I don't truly ever get cramps but I want to cry   -3 weeks added onto this means my periods is over a month.
46	251	When I got my period, my cramps have been worse than they've ever been in my life, and that's quite the accomplishment because they've always been bad.
46	252	I had to swap from Noriday to this as I was having irregular bleeding and very bad cramps.
46	253	Only other downside is my period cramps are extremely worse than they were before I started the pill.
46	254	Before it was 3-4 days of regular bleeding, with cramps on the first day.
46	255	Now it lasts 2 days, barely any bleeding but the most painful cramps I've ever experienced.
46	256	In addition, the painful pains in the abdominal were like having menstrual cramps.
46	257	I go to university and I had to leave class because I had explosive diarrhea and when I say painful I mean excruciating cramps and blood clots falling out of my vagina every time I went to the bathroom (sorry for getting too personal).
46	258	I was originally prescribed this pill to help with fainting spells on my period, irregular periods, severe cramps, and the impression that I might have had endometriosis.
46	259	I started on this pill 5 years ago (at age 20) due to extremely painful cramps that prohibited me from attending class.
46	260	I have been on this pill for about 2 years now, and about 6 months ago the cramps have started to get really bad.
46	261	I enjoy the light period and my cramps are little to none.
46	262	Mood is fine, I never have cramps, and I've never gained weight on this pill.
46	263	Making me want to scream in pain from my cramps.
46	264	I was originally on Microgestin 1/20 and I did notice a big improvement with the cysts and how bad my cramps were during period.
46	265	A day or two before I finish my active pills I get mild cramps, then when I'm on placebo week my period comes and is there for good 5-6 days just like my period is if I were not taking the pill.
46	266	When I started the microgestin 1.5/30 the heavy bleeding and painful cramps went away.
46	267	My periods are now light and the cramps are little to none.
46	268	I'm 18 and I rarely had any sort of painful cramps and for the past 4 months I've had cramps that are so painful it feels like I'm giving birth and having painful contractions.
46	269	No cramps ever.
46	270	Off of birth control, my periods are accompanied by horrible cramps and I would bleed heavily for 5 days.
46	271	I get 2 periods a month, super emotional, terrible cramps and crazy mood swings.
46	272	I also notice that my cramps are strong (5/10) considering I barely had cramps before these pills, and I get bloated often.
46	273	Overall it does prevent pregnancy, but crying, cramps, and bloating are the price you have to pay.
46	274	My periods are much shorter and lighter but my cramps are just as bad as always.
46	275	By October, me and my bf noticed that my boobs were swollen (he enjoyed that) and I am now having painful cramps every other week.
46	276	Periods aren't even that much shorter and I still get cramps and have an irregular cycle.
46	277	While it has never failed me in regards to contraception, it has given me crazy mood swings, sharp cramps, and intense sudden headaches that sometimes become migraines.
46	278	I also had no issue with my period (lasts around 3 days and is fairly light) it's also helped a lot with cramps.
46	279	Well I've been on  this pill going on two months now .I get a  nausea and back cramps when I take the pill.
46	280	I had spotting and light cramps every 2 weeks for about 5 months after I started taking it, but then all of a sudden the bleeding became irregular and has been ever since.
46	281	No cramps.
46	282	My period went from being heavy with INCREDIBLY painful cramps to a more or less non-existent period (I get slight spotting about 2 days into the no-dose pills for a day and that's it!)
46	283	I had a concussion so I couldn't figure out what was causing me headaches but it was this pill and it didn't help with cramps or how much I bled on my period
46	284	My period is shorter and cramps are way less painful.
46	285	My period was only 4 days long but had horrible cramps the first 2 days so bad I almost couldn't go to work and cramps were never an issue for me.
46	286	The only pro for this pill is no cramps and lighter period.
46	287	I have NEVER experienced cramps or PMS ...
46	288	I originally started taking it for stomach cramps and regulating my period and I wish I never started taking it in the first place.
46	289	Not only was I nauseous 24/7 I got headaches, cramps in my upper and lower back, side pains, chest pains.
46	290	My boobs hurt and I got cramps.
46	291	I've always had irregular, lengthy, very painful periods and this pill drastically shortened my periods and regulated them my cramps have gotten worse if anything.
46	292	The problems I experienced were: major anxiety, irritability and agitation; nausea, one episode of extreme dizziness and headache to the point I wondered if I was having a stroke; breast tenderness, fluid retention; fatigue; strange dryness around my gums; abdominal cramps and a noticeable change in my bowel movements; an absolute loss of libido.
46	293	My cramps are terrible and my period is light.
46	294	i went on Junel fe about 15 months ago for extremely painful cramps during my period and for birth control, about two months after I lost most of my sex drive and over the course I've been taking it I went from 110-138, I'm 5'0 and 18, and even after all these months I'm still finding new stretch marks and gaining weight and I'm barely eating.
46	295	My PMS has decreased significantly and my period cramps suppressed.
46	296	That being said I did not like this pill otherwise, it gave me bad cramps, my breasts were very sore, and for a while thought I was pregnant because of the side effects that I was having (I wasn't pregnant).
46	297	Once I stopped taking it I noticed heavier periods, cramps (didn't have them before bcp), pain on my ovaries and headaches.
46	298	My period got lighter and it helped with my cramps but my goal is to improve my skin since it seems to be hormonal.
46	299	This pill causes me to have intense cramps.
46	300	No weight gain, no bloating, very few cramps, and no moodiness at all.
46	301	The first 3 months were hell as the other reviews pointed out, heavy bleeding that lasted two weeks for me, super emotional, cramps.
46	302	Still not pregnant (I take it religiously every day at noon) and cramps are minimal but I DO have painful gas at times.
46	303	Took this medicine for about two weeks and experienced mild stomach cramps, nausea, and gas.
46	304	I take Birth Control pills as a way to calm and treat my cramps during periods.
46	305	I noticed an instant improvement my first month: lighter bleeding and half as painful cramps.
46	306	I've never had weight issues with pill and never had bad cramps.
46	307	My cramps still exist and it does a good job at regulating my period, but my period starts and stops throughout the week of the placebo pills.
46	308	I had no real problems with Necon, except every month, a week before my period, I got super emotional and had a lot of mood swings and got lower back cramps.
46	309	My cramps are about the same, mostly in my back and legs but taper off as my period continues.
46	310	I used to get terrible cramps and even after taking the pill for a month the cramps were completely gone.
46	311	I had a regular period, mild cramps, and minimal PMS.
46	312	Since being put on Gildless by my insurance, my cramps are worse and the PMS has been much more prominent.
46	313	I was put on Microgestin 1/20 to not only prevent pregnancy, but to prevent the severe cramps I had.
46	314	It worked well by helping with the cramps and I had almost zero side effects but one- spotting.
46	315	It causes heavy discharge in between periods and I still get severe cramps.
46	316	My period only lasts about 3 days and my cramps have subsided considerably.
46	317	My cramps got worst my period got heavier and last longer
46	318	Zero cramps, headaches, nausea, spotting, mood swings, weight change, or change in sex drive.
46	319	It seems to work well, but I noticed a more tired feeling with it during my first period and my cramps were worse.
46	320	The first month, I experienced cramps in my thighs, slight fatigue and mood swings; these symptoms disappeared after the first month.
46	321	My cramps and back pain were unbearable, even though it didn't last long.
46	322	My cramps, however, seem to have gotten worse.
46	323	No noticeable weight gain, and no mood swings and it definitely helped with cramps.
46	324	This pill has caused me to have extreme cramps, major mood swings, bloating, back pain, breast tenderness, and a very very heavy period.
46	325	I used to have a heavy period, with loads of cramps.
46	326	Then I got on this and had no cramps and very little bleeding.
46	327	My periods are regular and I have had no mood swings, cramps, or migraines.
46	328	It did make my periods very regular, short, and light and lessened the severity of my cramps.
46	329	Periods are light with a little cramp here and there but besides that it’s very effective, been on it for 6 months with unprotected sex and haven’t got pregnant yet.
46	330	My periods are light, barley noticeable at all I bleed two days and only use a few regular tampons those two days and don't cramp a bit.
46	331	On the pill, I rarely experience a cramp and my bleeding is light for about 2 Days.
46	332	I haven't had any change in appetite or weight gain but I do have some break outs sometimes, my boobs will be really sore but thats like 2 days out of the month, and sometimes I cramp but it's nothing like what I was dealing with before I got on this pill.
46	333	I also had premenstural dysphoric disorder and extreme cramping.
46	334	My new doctor put me on this birth control to try to ease my ovarian pain and severe cramping.
46	335	Since the company switched to the gel cap...I have bloated, cramping, and headaches, for the whole two months.
46	336	The first month met me with with severe, painful cramping for 48 hours straight with no relief, and I definitely had breakthrough bleeding in the first 2 months or so.
46	337	Little to no cramping and light periods that last 3-5 days.
46	338	I just started 2 months ago I'm entering my 3rd month today but I can say that it's going okay so far considering that I have tried other birth control and they were awful but so far my two periods have been light between 2-3 days light cramping so that a plus I also feel more tired been sleeping extra hours but the birth control seems to be working in going to keep trying it and see how it keeps working .
46	339	This is my first time on BC & before this pill I had intolerable cramping at all times of the month in addition to very heavy bleeding when I was on my period.
46	340	I skipped the sugar pills as directed and day one of honeymoon period came today is day 8 still bleeding longer and cramping more than I ever do!
46	341	I've always had a regular 5 day periods with light cramping and moderate flow and now it's all over the place.
46	342	Used to have very heavy periods and extreme cramping, now I hardly notice I'm on my period.
46	343	Have had no mood swings, no cramping, no weight gain (which is my biggest concern) and no spotting.
46	344	My periods were little to non-existent, no cramping, but my PMS was off the charts brutal.
46	345	While on lolestrin, my periods consisted of spotting and average side effects, nothing too serious, but after one month of micro I got my period and it was heavy and the cramping was so painful I had to leave my class.
46	346	I do have cramping & headaches a couple hours before getting it but nothing crazy that I cannot tolerate.
46	347	But after starting the pill, my periods are regular enough I can predict them down to the hour, they are very light and short, and I have almost no cramping at all!
46	348	With the first month of Gildess, my period was "normal" and now after 3 years of use I get very light periods for less than a day and little to no cramping and no other adverse side effects.
46	349	Although it solved my original problem of severe cramping (what I thought was ovarian cysts), Microgestin had many side effects for me.
46	350	I began taking birth control to help control my heavy bleeding and cramping.
46	351	My period was very light and I barely had any cramping!
46	352	There's a lot of cramping.
46	353	Other than that I haven't had any cramping or a period.
46	354	Before this I was on the junel 1/20 which my cramping was horrible and my periods were heavy when I had them.
46	355	My skin always looked radiant, my periods were super-duper light every month, no cramping, and I never once had a pregnancy scare.
46	356	Okay so I have been taking Necon for 9 months because of heavy cramping and long periods.
46	357	Not cramping nor spotting, but the nausea, loss of appetite, and severe irritability caused by Necon aren't worth it.
46	358	I still get periods on this pill lasting 2-6 days, with only one day of bad cramping and they tend to be light.
46	359	there is some heavy spotting that comes unpredictably and heavy cramping at times but it works and if you have insurance it should be free.
46	360	I do get more migraines and slight abdominal cramping during placebo week, no change in sex drive, weight and no melasma, so I'd say this definitely a better pill on the market for me!
46	361	Lighter, regular periods with no cramping - it was doing the job.
46	362	Zero nasty side effects like headaches, cramping, long periods, moodiness, etc.
46	363	My periods were shorter, lighter, minimal to no cramping, no weight gain, no crazy mood changes, and the birth control was stable, no spotting.
46	364	In the second week I had horrible uterine cramping and terrible cramping during my period also.
46	365	It was horrible, no pain really but just way too long and annoying now on the 3 month mark I have been having symptoms of IBS and acid reflux so nauseous all the time and very bloated and crampy, not to mention my anxiety of pregnancy has sky rocketed due to these side effects and the fact my period is so light and only last 4 to 6 days, with no symptoms.
46	366	I switched from Lo Loestrin to Blisovi because although I had almost no side effects otherwise on the Lolo, I kept spotting.
46	367	Then in the second month the bleeding never stopped, I wouldn't call it spotting because it was more than that.
46	368	I was constantly spotting, eating, and crying.
46	369	I had a few months with some between period spotting, but that has stopped.
46	370	Just spotting and very light for 2-3 days.
46	371	I was having bleeding and spotting problems, so they told me this would help.
46	372	It stopped the bleeding and spotting.
46	373	I then started spotting heavily and had bad anxiety and mood swings.
46	374	I’m now on my 4th pack and spotting is gone and I feel like my normal self again.
46	375	Heavy spotting a week or two after my period.
46	376	I switched from Tri-Sprintec because of spotting.
46	377	I've never had any spotting on or off the pill and with Mibelas I was spotting for at least a week every month in the middle of the pack, and then I'd still get my period.
46	378	Not spotting - bleeding, full on, need a tampon bleeding.
46	379	After being on medicine for 11 days, after having very regular periods for years and only spotting 2-3x in my entire life.
46	380	I've had spotting but I hear that's expected the first three months.
46	381	I have been on modicon in the past with no side effects except for a little spotting.
46	382	My moods are pretty even, I do get some brown spotting on and off again and I am hoping with longer use it will subside.
46	383	Despite taking it every day without missing a day or time, I had break through bleeding and a lot of heavy spotting.
46	384	I have been taking this birth control for almost a year now and this has been the only one to work for me without any spotting or nausea etc.
46	385	The week before my period I was spotting which has never happened before.
46	386	It's been good so far, although my period seems to have lasted longer than normal (~8 days, and I'm still spotting...) I also feel like I've gained a few pounds (~2-3), which is strange because I've been eating better and exercising more, and I do also feel more bloated.
46	387	I have to take it the same time everyday or I start spotting, and I have never been this moody.
46	388	I have been on it for 5 months and I'm lucky if I even get spotting.
46	389	I only took it for about 3 months but it made my periods very irregular, I would have spotting on and off two weeks before my period and it caused me to gain 10 pounds.
46	390	I've tried 4-5 other BC pills and all gave me side effects like melasma, spotting, bloating, or yeast infections, but I have none of that now.
46	391	Within the first couple of months, I had mild spotting, and the side effects of my period did not go away.
46	392	I've been on Taytulla for 4 months now, and it has been amazing preventing pregnancy and stopping my spotting.
46	393	My periods were very irregular and I experienced spotting and a low sex drive for first three months after starting.
46	394	Had to take two pills per day just to stop spotting, and even then - no luck.
46	395	The first few months I experienced mood swings and brown spotting but other than that it works quite well.
46	396	But in the beginning I did have diarrhea and abdominal pain I had very light spotting barely anything at all.
46	397	I seem to have less breakouts and I can take 3 packs in a row to skip periods with ZERO spotting.
46	398	Changing pills made me have spotting for two weeks then I notice I did not wanted to run, walk, or clean.
46	399	I actually would only get a very light (just spotting pretty much) period once every 3 months or so which my doctor said was normal with this birth control.
46	400	After the first couple of months of spotting both the second and fourth weeks I haven't gotten my period since.
46	401	I also have some spotting during the active weeks if I am stressed.
46	402	I didn't experience side effects Besides some light spotting at first.
46	403	I was not put off by the breast tenderness and the larger cup size and the seemingly constant spotting because my doctor told me that is normal for about 2 months when just beginning a pill.
46	404	My skin cleared up, and I haven't had a period in I don't remember how long (I skip the placebo pills), with zero spotting or anything.
46	405	After that I had sex with my boyfriend and started spotting the very next day for about two and half weeks.
46	406	While spotting I doubled up on pills to stop it and also took them a the same time everyday.
46	407	The spotting was often very heavy some days but  light others.
46	408	I stopped spotting two days ago and I thought everything was fine until I went to the bath room and i saw a little red.
46	409	Someone help how to i stop spotting ?
46	410	I started on 1/20 and had random spotting through the month, but when I bumped up to 1.5/30 it was fixed right away.
46	411	Only con is that I have experienced occasional break through spotting before my cycle some months.
46	412	I was placed on Minastrin 24 FE after I complained about horrible 5-7 day periods, a week off, then 4 days of spotting that has been happening for 14 months.
46	413	My doc said this would stop the 2nd spotting period I had every month.
46	414	Well since I have been on the pill I have had a whole month of bleeding, not spotting.
46	415	But I suddenly started spotting frequently on lutera to the point I needed pantyliners 24-7, so she tried me on this.
46	416	I would take frequent spotting anyday over this.
46	417	I took it as instructed, I started it on the Sunday during my period, as my period just started the day before (Saturday), and during then, I had some extended spotting after my period was done and then again later on that first month I had some spotting but it was light.
46	418	I have my period every 3 months and it's roughly 4-5 days of light spotting.
46	419	I do not experience any discharge or spotting either.
46	420	Its the end of the pack and I started spotting early this week on A Monday the 15 and still bleeding and it's Saturday.
46	421	I have experienced weight GAIN but that could also be because I only have a period once every three months (with PMS and some spotting in between).
46	422	I have a lot of unprotected sex and it's nice to know when I start spotting a little that it's okay.
46	423	I loved it, but after a few years I started randomly spotting so my doctor switched me to Nortrel because it had higher levels of estrogen.
46	424	No headaches or spotting.
46	425	The only negative side effects I had were that I was a bit more emotional than usually in the first two weeks of use, and that for a few months, I would have a bit of light spotting leading up to my period.
46	426	I changed due to spotting and increased mood swings with my previous birth control.
46	427	The usual side effects for me on birth control is weight gain, moody, no energy, and spotting.
46	428	spotting for the first month.
46	429	My periods are super light, much like spotting, and only lasts a few days.
46	430	I continued taking the prescription in hopes the spotting would pass, but it didn't.
46	431	In my 3rd and 4th month I was spotting A LOT!
46	432	Had minor spotting only in the beginning.
46	433	I had spotting between periods for the first few months I took it - way longer than you're supposed to.
46	434	Before beginning Necon 1 / 35 I was taking Loestrin and I was constantly spotting and I had my period three times in one month.
46	435	No spotting after the 2nd month, period only lasts 3 days, it's really great.
46	436	The only side effect that happened to me was spotting in the first 2 weeks.
46	437	In the beginning I had severe headaches and spotting.
46	438	The only other bad thing I️ have to say about I️t is that I️t made me spot for a week leading up to my period.
46	439	If you don’t take it around the same time every day you spot (at least for me I did).
46	440	My breasts did increase and size, and my period got much lighter to where I would only spot for one day.
46	441	I did spot a little in week 1 and then again for a day in week 3, but my period is much lighter than normal, and I've heard that it regulates in a few months' time.
46	442	Then I started to get a bald spot on my scalp.
46	443	Unfortunately, my body got used to this pill causing me to start to spot in between periods and my spotting/period would last for days.
46	444	Unfortunately after 6 years my body must have gotten used to the pill, so I switched to Reclispen because I started get spot heavily in-between my period pretty much all the time.
46	445	I've gained weight on it and the worst of all I spot every month at the beginning of the second week.
46	446	If I did not take my pill at the same time each day I would spot.
46	447	Every other birth control pill I would constantly spot and with this one I didn't.
46	448	I pretty much spotted during the entire duration of me taking the pill.
46	449	I took it for 6 months and I had no migraines episodes after I started it, didn't have my periods (not even spotted) and therefore no PMS symptoms.
46	450	I spotted almost every day.
46	451	I started it on the first day of my period and throughout the day didn't feel any standard side effects (dizziness, nausea, headache, increased appetite, etc).
46	452	The biggest side effect I️ noticed is that I️t gave me a mild headache almost everyday but I’ve always been prone to migraines.
46	453	I had my 4th baby in January of 17, and I started taking BlisoviFe 1.5/30 the first two months was bad cause I had migraines in the middle where my period were supposed to happen and it did it was normal but I never had a headache like that since I was a child..
46	454	I feel just like I did before .. i have normal period, no headache , no weight gain.. nothing !
46	455	Suddenly I had a throbbing headache that was literally with me for 2 weeks!
46	456	It's now been a 1.5 weeks since I've been off it & guess what, no headache!
46	457	I had a headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, fatigue, and extreme anxiety which I have never had before at this excessive level.
46	458	This pill personally gave me heavy bleeding and severe headache
46	459	I didn't notice any mood changes or anything, but several things happened with my body: Every day on this pill (1st & 2nd pack) I woke up with a hangover type headache.
46	460	However, I had a headache literally every evening on this pill.
46	461	I'm constantly tired, have a persistent headache, feel like rundown like I'm about to develop a cold, sinus pressure, irritable mood, achy body.
46	462	Over 4 months I gained 15 pounds, had a headache almost every other day, extreme bloating and distention, fatigue, dizziness, indigestion, hazy vision and problems with my contacts.
46	463	I have constant mood swings, I cry all the time for no reason, I have a CONSTANT throbbing headache, I have no sex drive whatsoever, my appetite has changed, and somehow my breasts got smaller..
46	464	My main issue with it was that by day four of my period I would get a withdrawal headache that would last until I took the first pill of my next pack.
46	465	I've also had a terrible headache every day... One side effect I've had all along is lack of sex drive.
46	466	The first night I took This pill I got the worst headache that woke me up, followed by severe nausea and vomiting.
46	467	But with this pill by the end of the month I had experienced a real bad headache, sharp stomach pains, and vision problems.
46	468	Periods are longer and constant pain and headaches.
46	469	I have noticed bad headaches when I am suppose to be on my period week as well as some weight gain.
46	470	No breakouts, no headaches, no weight gain or food cravings.
46	471	I am experiencing some headaches and nausea, but nothing unmanageable.
46	472	CVS switched me to Mibelas, and I experienced terrible headaches and extreme shortness of breathe to the point I thought I was going to choke to death.
46	473	I had constant headaches for the 2 months I was taking it, and severe anxiety.
46	474	My ob prescribed me this BC I just had gives birth two months ago and it was ok for the first week and a half and then I noticed I was gaining weight craving different foods then I started having headaches that got progressively worse turning into migraines ..then I started bleeding my period wasn't even suppose to start yet and I'm still bleeding very heavily super tampons barely work I don't not recommend this BC ..although everyones body is different
46	475	It killed my sex drive and gave me headaches.
46	476	Month one I had bloating and breast pains, month two I was getting headaches about every other day (not migraines, just annoying).
46	477	I've had less headaches this month but I've still had more than I ever had with Minestrin.
46	478	The headaches were never ending and It made me so hungry!
46	479	I'm not crazy hungry anymore and my headaches are gone!
46	480	Also I will get headaches for a week to 2 weeks straight which has never happened to me.
46	481	Since being on Blisovi, I have gained 10 lbs, fainted twice, have horrible headaches and dizzy spells, nauseous constantly, no appetite, very sad, and get angry very easily.
46	482	For some reason Microgestin gave me insane headaches.
46	483	At first I was like, ok. 1 or 2 headaches every other week is fine.
46	484	Then I did some research & found that this bc can cause crazy amounts of headaches.
46	485	Had a good amount of breast swelling and tenderness as well as headaches for about a week or two in the first and second month which is minor is my book.
46	486	Caused extreme nausea and fatigue and terrible headaches daily.
46	487	I have no headaches, vomiting nothing.
46	488	Terrible non-stop headaches for 45 days straight.
46	489	I experience slight breast tenderness toward the end of the pill pack and headaches for a couple days when beginning a new pack.
46	490	I was fine in the first couple of months taking it, just nauseous here and there and occasional headaches, it was a good start.
46	491	I have gained 12 lbs since then, had terrible headaches and lack of sleep, period has been longer and heavier as well as my anxiety is at an all time high.
46	492	These issues along with extreme mood swings/irratibility, frequent headaches, fatigue, and lack of motivation to do anything (despite being a motivated person before) caused me to switch back to Minastrin, even though I had to pay more because my insurance doesn't cover it .
46	493	I should've known when I first began, because I got headaches endlessly when I started and gained weight (plus it was my freshman year of college, so double the weight), and my skin has suffered as well.
46	494	I'm also experiencing headaches and weight gain.
46	495	My doctor told me to take this birth control and I been taking it for four days now, and I feel horrible, nausea, headaches and I feel weak and I always sleep, I just want to know if it gets better or if any of you ladies went through this.
46	496	I have horrible headaches, some weight gain, breast tenderness, and exhaustion.
46	497	I had no problems--no fatigue, no stomach ache, no headaches, just basically nothing out of the ordinary.
46	498	I first got my period I had insane headaches and thought I just needed, to adapt to the pill.
46	499	I've also had headaches (and migraines) almost everyday.
46	500	These headaches are debilitating.
46	501	No increase in headaches from my normal amount, and no weird mood swings.
46	502	Spotted for several months and headaches galore.
46	503	Within days of being on it, I had headaches, nausea, mood swings.
46	504	I don't get headaches or mood swings.
46	505	My first week I experienced headaches, not sure if it was stress from work or the pill or both but they eventually subsided.
46	506	Never any headaches, food cravings, significant loss or weight gain, bloating.
46	507	Besides the headaches that I get once in a while this pill seems to be treating me good.
46	508	Terrible mood swings, horrendous weight gain (because if i don't eat every hour I get sick, shake and headaches - even after switching to taking the pill at night AND eating healthy alternatives - fruit, veggies, hell even crackers) How is it I actually LOSE weight (5-10 lbs ) when I start my period?
46	509	Since being on this pill, I've had my period nonstop, skin breakouts, and mind-numbing headaches whenever close to orgasm.
46	510	I had some headaches initially when I first started taking it but they went away after the first month of being on the pill.
46	511	I was very concerned because these were bad headaches.
46	512	I like this pill on all other aspects but it's just not worth the horribly headaches.
46	513	In the past 2 months I have gained 10+lbs, gone up a cup size, my pants don't fit, blurred vision, headaches, lethargic hungover feeling, and depression.
46	514	My pharmacist put me on this when i have been on GILDESS 1.5/30 (21) ORAL for almost 2 years and that was perfect but now that i'm on Microgestin Fe 1.5/30 I'm having horrible headaches, major mood swings, and depression.
46	515	I originally stopped taking birth control because I would get such bad headaches.
46	516	Constant headaches, weight gain, blurred or double vision, major mood swings--every single side effect is true.
46	517	Blinding headaches.
46	518	First month didn't like it- was itchy for no reason, frequent headaches that wouldn't go away.
46	519	I still do suffer pretty bad headaches but less severe and less often.
46	520	If you get migraine headaches w/ aura, I wouldn't recommend this pill.
46	521	I usually get 2 headaches a month now when before starting birth control, I could go just about 3-4 months without a migraine.
46	522	There is a lot of estrogen in it so it caused me to get headaches.
46	523	Since I been on this medicine people around says I have gotten mean, I sleep a lot, I have headaches, but that is mostly it.
46	524	Slight headaches and moodiness right before my period, although the I experience moodiness throughout the cycle.
46	525	The periods lightened/shortened with this pill, but I started getting a ton of side effects I never had before; such as nausea, headaches, constant aching during periods, bloating, weight gain around my stomach area, and constipation.
46	526	I did experience back pain, breakouts, breast tenderness, and headaches but it went away.
46	527	Spotting, nausea, headaches, weight gain, are all a few side effects.
46	528	I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great!
46	529	Microgestin gave me nausea and headaches when I first started taking it but it went away after the second month.
46	530	In my first month I've experienced migraine-like headaches and almost daily nausea, which subsided during my hormone-free week.
46	531	I take the period at night, but if I have to stay up for a significant amount of time after I take the pill, I have to deal with terrible headaches.
46	532	It gives me terrible lingering headaches; which sometimes turn into migraines.
46	533	I was on this birth control for almost 10 years...it was very effective at preventing pregnancy, even though I missed it a few times and there weren't any crazy noticeable side effects like weight gain, nausea, headaches, etc.
46	534	The first 3 months I suffered with very tender breasts, headaches, breakthrough bleeding, bloating, and nausea, but month 4 has been a breeze.
46	535	I get a migraine every single day after eating, usually about 6 hours into my day, extreme nausea, neck pain, and brain fog.
46	536	I called my doctor and then took myself to urgent care, they were talking about diagnosis from complicated migraine up to stroke.
46	537	In the beginning I had terrible migraines, breast pain, depression for about 1 week.
46	538	Cramps are horrible, I get really bad migraines and lost of appetite.
46	539	I can't do another day of migraines.
46	540	So far good, I just hate when I get to the second row I experience severe migraines...
46	541	I suffer from migraines but haven't had many since being on this pill.
46	542	They make me sick to my stomach, and I've had terrible migraines.
46	543	My Gyno recommended this pill to help with my PMS symptoms and migraines.
46	544	As soon as I began using Taytulla I developed sudden severe migraines.
46	545	And huge migraines.
46	546	After only the first week of taking Taytulla I experienced intense, horrible debilitating migraines, neck pain, depression, and EXTERME fatigue.
46	547	And just like that from one day to another my migraines and neck pain TOTALLY DISAPPEARED!
46	548	I was having migraines with aura, anxiety, I bled for 17 days (when I normally don't have a period except for every 3 months), and had nipple discharge, as well as spontaneous nosebleeds.
46	549	I'm talking migraines so bad that I have to close my eyes and crawl to get anywhere I need to go, if I can even move at all.
46	550	As someone who infrequently suffers migraines, this pill made them a thousand times worse.
46	551	I've been off it for a year and a few months at this point, and have seen a huge reduction in migraines and problems with my libido since.
46	552	I was on Microgestion Fe 1/20 for around 10 months due to migraines.
46	553	My doctor switched me over from tri privefem because I got very bad migraines.
46	554	On Xulane, I was experiencing heavy flow, migraines, mood swings, and a crazy sex drive, and was really hard for me to lose weight.
46	555	Now I no longer experience ANY migraines, mood swings and my sex drive seems a lot more normal.
46	556	Debilitating migraines, nausea, vomiting, etc.
46	557	Cons include: weight gain, constant bloating, hair loss, migraines, breast sagging, zero sex drive, no energy, down mood.
46	558	I have gained a ton of weight without changing my eating or exercising habits, have been getting horrible migraines, even though I had never experienced one until this pill, have been getting petechiae everywhere, and scary mood swings.
46	559	I get migraines and I am never hungry.
46	560	Had bad migraines the first 5-6 months of taking it.
46	561	My doctor had prescribed me with it to control my migraines and periods.
46	562	Causes severe migraines in my case, weight gaining (I used to weigh 117lbs after using it for a couple of months I'm 130lbs).
46	563	Sex drive good.
46	564	My sex drive is non existent and the vaginal dryness is unbearable.
46	565	Less sex drive & less self lubrication.
46	566	Sex drive was normal as well.
46	567	I have zero sex drive now too.
46	568	Now my period only lasts 3 days, and my sex drive is still there :).
46	569	Sex drive is fine, I have experienced any mood changes or anything like that.
46	570	At first it made my sex drive non-existent... but after a while of taking it I feel back to normal, if not better!
46	571	I also have barely any sex drive whatsoever.
46	572	Also it made me very irritable and lowered my sex drive by a ton
46	573	So until then I have been on 4 different birth controls and I was on the Junel 1/20 for 3 months and that made me gained weight, I was depressed and mean, had no sex drive.
46	574	I completely have NO SEX DRIVE.
46	575	Sex drive has decreased, and haven't been able to get "wet" since the first month or so.
46	576	It's even effected my sex drive, which is now non existent.
46	577	I've been on the Junel Fe 1.5/30 28 day, for 6 months and I've gained about 17 pounds while on this, no anxiety/depression but my sex drive did decrease significantly to the point where it concerned me.
46	578	My sex drive came back after I switched from the Lo Loestrin.
46	579	But in terms of everything else it has been great so far, no mood swings/anxiety, no decrease in sex drive, and good skin.
46	580	Decrease in sex drive.
46	581	Absolutely lowered my sex drive and sex was painful because of vaginal dryness.
46	582	I do have to say I've had some constipation but don't know if it is related to the pill and also slightly lowered sex drive but again not 100% sure if that's related to the pill.
46	583	In addition, my sex drive went way down.
46	584	Pros: Sex drive has increased.
46	585	Every other BCP killed my sex drive.
46	586	I've been on this pill for about 3 months and haven't had any issues.I am wondering about my sex drive though but I am not sure yet if its the pill or work stress because I have a lot of that.
46	587	Not to mention this birth control KILLED my sex drive.
46	588	It did eliminate my sex drive almost completely which I loved but I can see why many people wouldn't like that side effect.
46	589	I was so moody, crying at the smallest things, and my sex drive was GONE.
46	590	Mood swings, depression, sadness, lower sex drive, increase appetite and oh yeah a whole lot of bleeding.
46	591	Now that it's November, I notice that my sex drive has decreased a little, I have terrible mood swings, and I'm lethargic most of the time :(  But overall, the pill is very effective; my bf has not "pulled out" since I started and still no pregnancy!
46	592	My anxiety is bad and my sex drive is very low if not nonexistent anymore.
46	593	One thing this pill did do it prevent me from getting pregnant because my sex drive has been so low I haven't been able to have sex!
46	594	The only reason I rate it 9/10 is because sometimes I feel like my sex drive is lower at times.
46	595	The worst part, however, is that this BC has completely destroyed my sex drive.
46	596	I've been taking for about a year and had horrible side effects swollen sore breasts, horrible anxiety/depression, no sex drive at all, vaginal dryness, and chronic yeast infections.
46	597	I've given it 4 months and during that time I've experienced: lower mood/ mood swings, low sex drive and vaginal dryness (very unwanted obviously), very sore and tender breasts (first month/ than increase in size), weight gain- solid 15lbs, water retention... after reading all the negative reviews that are similar to mine I've cemented the fact that I'll stop this pill as of today.
46	598	I like the pill just wish I wasn't so emotional,  my sex drive it's awesome.
46	599	I had a decrease in sex drive.
46	600	My sex drive has decreased very badly, and I have been experiencing awful mood swings that are really starting to impact my day to day life and I am switching immediately.
46	601	I get slightly queezy but it goes away quickly I have not experienced moodiness, my face is super clear, no break through bleeding, and no loss in sex drive or a dry vagina.
46	602	I think because I was on it for so long, I didn't realize the side effects until I went off of it...once I stopped, I felt like a completely different and better person...my sex drive went through the roof and I realized how much it had suppressed my sex drive this whole time.
46	603	It's not that I don't have a sex drive, it's just that sex HURTS without an hour of foreplay and a gallon of lubricant.
46	604	I've had no MAJOR side effects with Femcon (I have noticed a slight decrease in my sex drive) but am starting to look elsewhere for the sheer reason that it costs me $50 a pack.
46	605	Personally no matter what birth control I have been on, I have always experienced a lower sex drive but I guess that's just a sacrifice I've learned to live with but other than that my body reacted very well to it.
46	606	I just remember regular periods, no real weight gain, no change in sex drive.
46	607	No real side effects, no change in sex drive, nor mood.
46	608	Also, one of the biggest problems I had with it was that I had a MAJOR decrease in my sex drive.
46	609	And have a great sex drive.
46	610	I wanted to try and wait it out for 3 months but my libido and lubrication was non-existent to the point where sex started to hurt so that was my stopping point.
46	611	I had to switch because it decreased my libido a significant amount and caused a lot of issues with sex.
46	612	After looking at everyone’s experiences it has made me realize I️ also have weight gain (10lb), major mood swings, low libido, and emotional spells for no reason.
46	613	My libido is about 50% less than what it was before but I'm okay with that.
46	614	No weight gain (actually weight loss), no mood swings, no change in libido.
46	615	My libido has significantly decreased which is a bummer.
46	616	My only complaint is that my libido is non existent.
46	617	I'm switching to an IUD because I don't want to worry about a daily pill and I'm really hoping it will give me back my libido.
46	618	I have noticed a reduction in libido over time but it's minimal and manageable.
46	619	I had no libido.
46	620	However, that could have been because it knocked my libido down quite a bit so I was basically abstinent.
46	621	No side effects for me, no nausea, no mood swings and loss of libido.
46	622	My libido is still high and I haven't had issues with arousal.
46	623	Zero libido.
46	624	The best one; my libido is in the basement.
46	625	The only thing is lowered libido but hey, after all there is no perfect pill that won't have any side effects!
46	626	No weight gain.
46	627	I did not have any major weight gain, I instead lost weight.
46	628	First birth control I've ever been on and it has been great to me, skin is the clearest it has ever been, not pregnant, and weight gain has been in the right places.
46	629	I've never been pregnant, no weight gain, less mood swings than other bc pills.
46	630	I haven't noticed any major weight gain, but I do work out regularly.
46	631	I have been on Junel for about 8 months now but have noticed weight gain and depression.
46	632	I’m on my second week and oddly enough my skin is very clear, no increased appetite or weight gain, and very minimal side effects.
46	633	Mood swings, weight gain and who knows what other side effects I am suffering, stopping it right now.
46	634	I had no weight gain, light periods that lasted three days.
46	635	I have had slight weight gain (120-124).
46	636	This weight gain is extremely embarrassing to the point where I've had worsened depression.
46	637	I had tried so many other pills and everything gave me side effects like extreme anxiety, weight gain, high blood pressure, and breakthrough bleeding.
46	638	When I first started the pill things were fine I didn't have any abnormal side effects except for the slight, almost unnoticeable weight gain.
46	639	The weight gain is the only reason why my rating was so low.
46	640	I did not experience weight gain.
46	641	Mood swings, tears, weight gain.
46	642	I had no problems with weight gain or any side effects really.
46	643	As far as weight gain, I have gained a couple pounds but I have been working out a lot more recently.
46	644	Weight gain, severe depression during pms and intense itching.
46	645	I'm not sure if weight gain was connected to that.
46	646	I have not had any problems on it besides weight gain.
46	647	I've been taking this pill for 3 years now, and have had nothing but good experiences--no weight gain, soreness, nausea--nothing.
46	648	It wreaked havoc on my health: IBS, hair loss, loss of metabolic flexibility, low energy, weight gain (2 lbs, but it still makes a different on my 5'3" frame)... instead of enjoying my workouts (I'm a gym rat), I was merely going through the motions.
46	649	EXTREME fatigue and weight gain, loss of period, sore breasts, nasuea.
46	650	No weight gain other then your typical bloating.
46	651	Other side effects were very minor, but included my breasts growing half a cup, probably 1-2lbs weight gain in my mid section.
46	652	I had no weight gain, but unfortunately no boob gain either haha.
46	653	The only downside is weight gain.
46	654	But for the last 3 monthsI have had no period at all (100% sure I'm not pregnant) , weight gain, and anxiety attacks.
46	655	Which brings me to the next lovely side effect; weight gain.
46	656	I didn't notice any weight gain while I was on this pill, however I worked out 3-4 times a week to avoid possible weight gain.
46	657	I think the worst is the weight gain and cryin spells.
46	658	I did not experience any weight gain or nausea.
46	659	What ever pill it was caused me unbearable side effects and immediate weight gain.
46	660	My biggest fear with bc pills was the weight gain - I can assure you now that this does not happen & is somewhat of a myth.
46	661	Gildess obviously works, I experienced no weight gain and shorter lighter periods.
46	662	I haven't noticed any weight gain, and I do like it a lot better now.
46	663	I love everything about it except the weight gain.
46	664	The only good thing about these pills were that I had no weight gain.
46	665	I also noticed a few pounds of weight gain.
46	666	No weight gain but this might be making it harder for me to lose my last 5 lbs of baby weight.
46	667	No noticeable weight gain.
46	668	Nothing to complain about, no attributable weight gain or mood changes.
46	669	My doctor has just switched me to a birth control pill with a lower dose of estrogen after having a baby, to see if the weight gain issues go away.
46	670	I was very nauseous and gained a couple pounds but after the couple weeks it started to regulate and went back to normal.
46	671	I don't even want to leave the house with how bad my skin is and I've gained 10 pounds too.
46	672	I have gained a significant amount of weight and SOOO irritable.
46	673	I also gained about 10lbs since starting it but I'm not positive I can attribute it to the birth control.
46	674	I have gained a little weight only a few pounds.
46	675	Now 2 months later, I have gained 10lbs & I can barely eat a meal because I get so bloated.
46	676	I have gained a few pounds so far Taytulla is great!
46	677	I have also gained 6 pounds, and this pill effects me emotionally very much.
46	678	Stops you from getting pregnant but I have gained so much weight it's crazy, my periods are basically gone and I'm about to stop taking it.
46	679	Hate this pill, have taken over a year and have gained 10 pounds since.
46	680	I have also gained five pounds after starting this pill (105 lbs to 110 lbs).
46	681	I've also gained 5 pounds while on this pill, I couldn't tell you if that's related to the pill but I'm 19 years old and 5'8 and was 115 when I started this but now am 120.
46	682	The pharmacy says it is the same as the other brand I was taking, but within 6 weeks of taking this birth control I gained about 18 pounds.
46	683	I also have gained around 5 pounds that I cant drop in only 3 months.
46	684	I have gained 15 pounds and it's extremely noticable.
46	685	I had increased appetite and gained another 10 pounds.
46	686	I started binge eating and gained about 20 lbs in two months.
46	687	I gained about 15 pounds in the 6 month period in which I took it.
46	688	It was 100% effective for that reason BUT on the other hand, I've gained 20 lbs that no matter what I did I couldn't lose them.
46	689	Like so many others on this thread, I've gained weight, couldn't control my anxiety, and the bloating was insane!
46	690	I haven't gained any weight or experienced any changes in my mood.
46	691	In 2 months I have gained over 10 lbs and I workout 5-6 days a week and my breast size went up a cup.
46	692	I've gained noticeable weight, solely because I feel like I cant stop eating.
46	693	My periods are horribly irregular, I constantly bleed in between and have gained over 10 pounds (which is a lot for as small as I am).
46	694	I gained about 10 pounds being on this pill.
46	695	I exercise regularly and have not gained weight.
46	696	It is now the first week of March and I've gained 20 lbs since starting this new BC.
46	697	I have never had so many health problems in my life until this drug was brought into my life I gained 30lbs.
46	698	I gained 15 lbs in that short amount of time & after researching it, I stopped taking it immediately, 2 days ago & my eye sight went back to normal almost immediately.
46	699	I haven't gained any more weight than before starting the pill but am struggling to lose weight.
46	700	BUT I gained 8 pounds and it made my blood pressure go through the roof.
46	701	I've been on it for about three months and I have gained about 20 pounds.
46	702	In the past month, I have gained 5 pounds (which is a lot on on my 5'1 frame), experienced EXTREME changes in mood (unpredictable anger/depression), and this past week I've started to experience frequent panic attacks.
46	703	I gained about 8 lbs in the first 6 months but I dont know if they're related.
46	704	After two months of taking this pill I developed the appetite of a linebacker and am literally starving 30 minutes after eating a meal and have gained some weight and am constantly bloated.
46	705	I also gained weight, had problems with my skin and found myself suffering from drastic mood swings and anxiety.
46	706	Much heavier periods than on Junel, gained about 10 lbs despite no substantial changes in diet or exercise levels.
46	707	I also gained a little weight but again, that may be my lifestyle (not always eating right and exercising).
46	708	My skin has always been great and I haven't gained any weight.
46	709	After the first month it was fine, I gained about 5-10 pounds since I started taking and also noticed my bra size went from a B to a D but I'm not complaining.
46	710	However, after starting these pills I'm constantly hungry, have no discipline and I've gained 6 lbs.
46	711	I gained 20 pounds in 8 months (went from my normal weight- 115 to 135 in the blink of an eye).
46	712	I haven't gained any weight but the pill seems to be aiding in weight loss as I work out a fair amount.
46	713	I gained over 20 pounds in 5 months.
46	714	I also have been very constipated and have had alot of gas although I havent gained any weight.
46	715	Well I've been on this birth control for a month now and the only negative thing is I gained 10 pounds in the past month.
46	716	Yet, I have gained about 8-10 pounds since starting this pill.
46	717	3rd, all same side effects from 2nd month + mental & emotional instability + gained 15lbs.
46	718	I gained about 8 pounds in the first month, all in my midsection (boobs and stomach!).
46	719	I gained a little weight, (which i wanted) but i believe that just came with age.
46	720	Since the switch I have had shorter periods about 2-3 days, but I have gained major weight and increased appetite.
46	721	I realized I have also been a bit irritable, gained weight and I have also been feeling very overwhelmed by things!
46	722	I gained 10 lbs after starting this birth control, which I didn't mind because I was underweight, so it was good for me to gain the weight.
46	723	I have always struggled with my weight and I have gained about 15-20 pounds in a year.
46	724	I gained 6 lbs (in 2 months) despite increased diet & exercise.
46	725	Within the first year, I gained 20 lbs that I could never lose.
46	726	I also experience nausea at night.
46	727	I felt nausea.
46	728	I take it at night so it doesn't make me have any nausea.
46	729	I never had any nausea, but I did notice that I was a little more emotional than usual during the first week or two that I started taking it, but after that everything was perfectly fine.
46	730	I kept a log of weight, moods, nausea, etc.
46	731	A little nausea at first, but nothing an afternoon ginger ale couldn't fix.
46	732	I have frequent nausea.
46	733	My mood swings became so severe and every month I would have incredible nausea the week before and after my period, yet I managed to gain about 5 pounds despite not having an appetite.
46	734	Just wanted to let people know about the nausea if they are sensitive  to that type of thing.
46	735	For the first 2 weeks the nausea was annoying and the tenderness of the breast, nothing unbearable though.
46	736	The only upside I saw from this pill was I actually lost weight, yet everything else that came with my PMS remained the same (tender areas on the body, swollen lymph nodes, bloatedness, nausea, etc.).
46	737	I experienced a lot of nausea, sometimes waking me up in the middle of the night.
46	738	Now, I'm getting spells of terrible anxiety and depression, upper abdominal pain, nausea, and can barely keep my contacts on my eyes.
46	739	This is my first birth control pill I've tried and the first night taking this and I woke up with severe nausea and have been in the bathroom vomiting on and off for 4 hours now.
46	740	At the beginning, it caused a LOT of nausea.
46	741	I'm about 6 months in now, and the nausea has almost disappeared.
46	742	Adverse effects when combined with caffeine or alcohol in the same 24 hours included insomnia and nausea.
46	743	Only a week into the new pills I started experiencing awful nausea and bloating.
46	744	Lots of nausea and stomach/upper abdominal discomfort and bloating.
46	745	I've had to call out of work because my head was pounding and I was overwhelmed with nausea.
46	746	I have been taking nausea medication almost daily.
46	747	I felt nausea about 2 hours after I took it and I noticed I had yeast infection.
46	748	I take my pill before bed so I don't notice any nausea.
46	749	I also had trouble with nausea and an upset stomach but it subsided after a week or so.
46	750	I did experience nausea the first 2 days of each new pack but as long as I had something to eat, it wasn't a problem.
46	751	I also had no desire to eat because of the constant nausea and abdominal pain.
46	752	I was puking every other day from the pain, not nausea.
46	753	However, I recently figured out that my nausea is due to high anxiety, which has been made VERY intense by this medication.
46	754	I started these pills 7 months ago, the first 3 months were awful, l got strong migranes and a lot of nausea.
46	755	Since starting microgestin I've noticed insane bloating and nausea and weird discharge.
46	756	The only bad side effect I have is very lightlight nausea after taking the pill, other than that I have had a very pleasant experience with the pill and do not plan on switching
46	757	The first couple of days taking Ortho Novum 777, I experienced light nausea but after that no more.
46	758	(Had to get off Levora because of seriously chronic nausea)The first month on Microgestin I was just a couple hours late taking a pill and bled almost immediately.
46	759	I also have some slight nausea, dizziness, breast tenderness and swelling, and some fatigue (usually within the first week of starting back up on the pill).
46	760	I experienced nausea right before periods, depression, anxiety, and extreme mood swings.
46	761	The first 3 days of taking the 21 day pack Junel, I did experience some nausea (mild, but didn't have an appetite.)
46	762	Also, I take my pill every morning on an empty stomach and don't experience any nausea or anything like that.
46	763	Only thing I don't have is the nausea!
46	764	No nausea.
46	765	But  every night since I started this pack, I've woke up with nausea and vomiting!
46	766	Also experienced hair loss and nausea.
46	767	Very bad the first week of each pack and still nausea most of the rest of the month.
46	768	Little to no side effects (with the exception of a little nausea for the first pack or two).
46	769	Extreme nausea at the beginning of the month.
46	770	I experienced constant nausea at the beginning of each pack and randomly throughout the pack.
46	771	I get a little nausea when starting a new pack so I always take at night (my only real hang up).
46	772	I have had very mild side effects ( light nausea and sore breasts) which only lasted two days.
46	773	After four years of taking Necon, I was starting to get EXTREMELY nauseous the last two weeks of the pack every month, so I just recently switched to a new birth control to try to get rid of the nausea.
46	774	I only had one side effect, which was nausea, the morning after the night I took it, and only that one time.
46	775	I have had zero other side effects, and the nausea hasn't come back.
46	776	But I lost my appetite and hardly eat anything, I'm overly moody, I get nauseated really easily, breast tenderness that went away after awhile.
46	777	I felt nauseous and had to take my weight in antacids.
46	778	I wake up out of my sleep because I’m so dizzy and nauseous.
46	779	After about a week of taking this, I woke up n the middle of the night to the most nauseous I've ever been and broke out in a rash on both of my arms.
46	780	I'm nauseous, I get light-headed, I have double vision, and I have a weird taste in my mouth that just won't go away.
46	781	Last month, the day after starting my 4th month pack, I woke up dizzy and nauseous.
46	782	Within the seven months that I was on this pill, I was nauseous from the time that I woke up to the time that I went to bed.
46	783	In fact, at least once a week I would actually get sick from being so nauseous.
46	784	A week after I started taking it, I started feeling more on-edge and anxious, along with nauseous and lightheaded with an overall crappy and irritable mood.
46	785	This made me severely nauseous, moody, and just made my anxiety horrendous.
46	786	Causes terrible breakouts and super nauseous.
46	787	I was nauseous daily, despite taking the pill with food, at night or at precisely the same time every day.
46	788	The first ~6 months were difficult (I had to take it with food or I'd get nauseous, certain times of the cycle it made me extremely tired, moody, etc).
46	789	At first I thought my stomach problem was from eating fast food but as I think about it I was nauseous the first month of taking this pill and it steadily got worse.
46	790	Also extremely bloated, always fatigued, and made me very nauseous.
46	791	Took it after dinner, and by the time it was like 2am I woke up extremely nauseous, ended up spending the entire night and morning throwing up.
46	792	I was very nauseous for a couple weeks.
46	793	It also makes me very nauseous.
46	794	The one draw back about this pill is every month when starting a new pack, I would be very nauseous for about 3-4 days(usually just in the morning).
46	795	The following morning I was super dizzy and felt like passing out.
46	796	My vision has deteriorated noticeably, and I have felt periodically dizzy.
46	797	I feel dizzy & squeeze at times.
46	798	Headaches, dizziness.
46	799	But from the second day onwards my period disappeared, I started to experience horrendous dizziness to the point I would class it as vertigo, and at one point I was sure I was having a heart attack because I had a very dull ache in my chest and my blood pressure was 172/151!
46	800	I've been taking it for a little over 4 years and it is very effective with  minimal side effects - mostly physical symptoms like slight dizziness from time to time and slight discoloration on my face which is easily covered with powder.
46	801	My mood swings were out of control and I experiences anxiety that turned into a really awful depression that effected my personal relationships.
46	802	I had taken birth control in the past, I was on Ortho tri-cyclen lo for about a year and didn’t really experience anything crazy besides mood swings and a lot of cravings.
46	803	Mood swings are horrible and is affecting my relationship.
46	804	Crazy mood swings, messed with my appetite, and my body just didn’t feel right.
46	805	In the last month or two I was on it I became very depressed and experienced mood swings.
46	806	But since being off Mibelas for 2 1/2 weeks and on Lo Loestrin I have lost around 2lbs and do not feel the depression or mood swings I felt in Mibelas.
46	807	And I’m now starting to really feel the effects of the mood swings and almost depressive state.
46	808	I’ve always had problems being on birth control with bad mood swings and depression.
46	809	In addition to the very depressing erratic mood swings, it exacerbated nerve issues in my spine, created burning down my legs, extreme back pain, which had been under control and feeling GREAT for months, until I began taking medicine.
46	810	I’ve noticed a lot of mood swings, increased anxiety, and this little part of me wants to say depression but I’m not sure if my increased anxiety is making it worse for me.
46	811	I started it & I had a great experience, basically no period & no mood swings!
46	812	Had very bad anxiety, mood swings, and low sex drive/libido.
46	813	Around month 5, I slowly started to have mood swings.
46	814	Before I started this medication, my periods were extremely painful and I had severe mood swings.
46	815	Really painful period, weight fluctuation, terrible mood swings.
46	816	& Did cause some mood swings.
46	817	Caused the wildest mood swings and made my body itch like crazy.
46	818	Two issues I can't aleviate are bloating 3-5 lbs for a week and period mood swings.
46	819	The first three months I'd have CRAZY mood swings but levelled out, and my breast size definitely increased.
46	820	I've had horrible mood swings on a past medication and haven't gotten even an ounce of that.
46	821	It has caused mood swings.
46	822	The mood swings, depression and fatigue are INTENSE.
46	823	I have thrown up about 6 times in the 3 weeks I started the pills and my boyfriend thinks I am insane from all the mood swings.
46	824	Nausea, mood swings... not worth it.
46	825	I experienced mood swings about a week into taking this pill and honestly did not recognize myself.
46	826	I have constant mood swings and cry at the drop of a pin which is extremely uncommon for me because I'm normally well tempered and rational.
46	827	I've also noticed I've developed bad depression and my mood swings are very intense.
46	828	Outrageous mood swings, like to the point of fighting with my husband and son over every little thing and bursting into tears for no particular reason (things which are NOT normal behavior for me!).
46	829	Yes my breast increased in size but my mood swings are getting the best of me.
46	830	I'm sure a lot is water weight but the mood swings are just terrible.
46	831	I immediately started having intense mood swings and would cry randomly for no reason.
46	832	My skin was clear, I didn't get pregnant, I didn't have mood swings, and my period was light.
46	833	I had 1 or 2 depressive mood swings in the first 2 months but otherwise no other side effects.
46	834	I also had horrible mood swings, not just while I was pms'ing but all the time.
46	835	I switched to this and it's been a dream come true because now I have my periods when I want them, no mood swings, and not pregnant so I guess it's doing its doing its job.
46	836	Dramatic mood swings; just this morning, I went from being a ray of sunshine to crying on the floor in my room because my jeans were tight.
46	837	Besides the extreme pain, I also experienced bad mood swings.
46	838	I have also been experiencing mood swings and crying spells.
46	839	I would get horrible mood swings a couple hours before and after I took the pill.
46	840	Breakouts got worse, had bad mood swings, and breakthrough bleeding.
46	841	The first three months I got mood swings bad, but now it works great!
46	842	My mood swings have actually calmed down a bit and I feel great taking the pills.
46	843	I've been on this pill for years and I'm finally starting to question whether my mood swings and irritability are caused by the pill or just my personality.
46	844	I switched to this pill because my Dr thought a higher dosage would help with mood swings.
46	845	I did not experience mood swings on it though, that was the good thing...but about the only good thing.
46	846	On for one month, my typically high-patience and calm mood changed to constant irrational mood swings, irritability and mild depression.
46	847	I am having mood swings and I get irritated a lot.
46	848	The first month also, until I got used to it, it did give me mood swings, but did not make me depressed.
46	849	I was nervous once I read the comments but remember everyone's body is different.
46	850	I was super nervous after my experience on Yaz but it hasn’t been too bad yet.
46	851	I wanted to share a review since I was really nervous about going on this pill, especially after seeing all the horrible reviews.
46	852	I barely leave my house anymore, I never hang out with my friends, I am always sad, nervous, tired, and anxious.
46	853	I was a little nervous to try the Microgestin but my side effects have been minimal.
46	854	I will also say, that reading all the negative reviews made me really nervous before taking this, but I have had no other medical changes besides the decrease in awful periods!
46	855	It makes me so uncomfortable and nervous to basically not get a period.
46	856	It was my first ever so I was really nervous!
46	857	I'm anxious, sad, depressed, I don't feel like myself anymore.
46	858	On my way home from work I started feeling anxious and light headed.
46	859	I've been very depressed, anxious, not myself at all, had crying outbursts, lost all interest in sex altogether (I'm 24, healthy, work out 3-4 times a week and eat well).
46	860	I am genuinely a happy person, and this birth control constantly has me feeling anxious or sad.
46	861	I had switched to blisovi due to insurance, as soon as I started taking it I felt depressed, anxious and like I was living in a bubble.
46	862	I would get anxious very easily over little things.
46	863	I feel anxious until point of vomiting.
46	864	I have been getting more anxious lately & I do worry that may be a side effect, but I am a person with anxiety disorders in general so I'm not too sure.
46	865	I am almost finished with the first pack and anxious to see what my period will be like.
46	866	My anxiety is probably the same.
46	867	I'm no longer happy with the things that made me happy,  I've had yeast infections, depression and anxiety.
46	868	The only negative to this pill was my anxiety.
46	869	I have diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder and I do not take medication for it.
46	870	However, I noticed while on this pill my anxiety worsened extremely.
46	871	I had SEVERE anxiety and panic attacks, literally could not sleep and ended up going to the hospital because I thought I was going to die.
46	872	I’ve never dealt with anxiety or depression, I consider myself a very happy person that enjoys life.
46	873	To anyone trying Taytulla please be careful ESPECIALLY if you suffer from anxiety and depression.
46	874	Some birth control makes my anxiety high, but I haven't noticed any major differences with this one.
46	875	I normally have terrible anxiety and mild depression but while on this pill I have noticed only mild and anxiety and zero depression.
46	876	I get horrible depression and anxiety, sometimes I cry for no reason.
46	877	This made me feel depression and anxiety which was new to me.
46	878	I would have anxiety constantly, felt annoyed at everything, I would have bursts of intense crying over nothing, I felt depressed and sad.
46	879	I switched from Azurette to this pill because I thought it was increasing my feelings of depression and anxiety.
46	880	I have had anxiety lately, but it was probably due to outside factors (19 unit course load and boy problems).
46	881	For the past few days I’ve been having anxiety about having depression like as if I’m scared to become depressed and I don’t like it AT ALL.
46	882	Since taking this pill I now have bad social anxiety, and constantly find myself tearing up for no reason at all.
46	883	We've been cautious in bed so I don't think I'm pregnant, but I haven't gotten my period yet, which has caused my anxiety to skyrocket even more.
46	884	I also felt a lot of anxiety and was very irritable.
46	885	My weight increased, my anxiety increased and I was fatigued all the time.
46	886	In fact, I feel like my anxiety is better than it's been in a long time.
46	887	My anxiety was still pretty bad.
46	888	After taking it for a few months my anxiety (which I had before taking it but was under control) became so much worse and I began having panic attacks every day, and I actually became depressed despite having no history of it.
46	889	My only complaint is that I'm now a major cry baby for the smallest reasons and my anxiety spikes up a little more than usual but other than that it's great, Acne is non existing, hair is glossier than usual, it's perfect I totally recommend this!
46	890	It wasn't until there was a mix up with my doctors and was off it for less than a week, did my appetite go back to normal, bloating down ( sometimes I would look 5 months pregnant) and anxiety lessened immensely.
46	891	I never have had anxiety in my life until this pill.
46	892	I wasn't depressed before the pill but now I am, and I have anxiety attacks at least once every week and lil' fits of crying and terrible, horrible thoughts happen every now and then.
46	893	I also have anxiety and am on medicine for that and have no counter acting side effects.
46	894	My anxiety is through the roof.
46	895	I do have anxiety problems so it's hard to tell if the birth control has been effecting that.
46	896	I do struggle with anxiety and depression, but if anything I've noticed a "levelling out" over the past month of taking Junel.
46	897	Typically a happy person all the time, but these pills caused me to experience extreme depression and anxiety for the first time in my life.
46	898	I am 4 months off of it and am still recovering from the anxiety and depression I experienced while on these pills.
46	899	It has amplified my anxiety.
46	900	I'm not sure if it was the pill or my skin, but I'm also pretty depressed and have lots of anxiety.
46	901	I don't have issues with anxiety or depression.
46	902	I ended up gaining another 10 lbs but I blame that on my anxiety meds I started.
46	903	I got off my anxiety meds & lost 15 lbs (no exercising).
46	904	As somebody with high anxiety I can't recommend this medication to anyone with any kind of stress disorder.
46	905	I also noticed it was heightening my anxiety, it made me very erratic and aggressive.
46	906	My anxiety came back full swing and that is not helpful being a college nursing student.
46	907	I have anxiety.
46	908	My anxiety went through the roof.
46	909	The enhanced anxiety was nuts!
46	910	It has caused depression and anxiety throughout the whole time.
46	911	The last past month I have been kind of depressed and having anxiety attacks.
46	912	I was so afraid it was going to trigger my anxiety (I have GAD) but it hasn't!
46	913	It has made my anxiety about getting pregnant even worse.
46	914	Beginning this month, my breasts became really tender making my anxiety even worse!
46	915	In addition, I've experienced periodic breast tenderness and am sometimes overly sensitive.
46	916	I did have slight breast tenderness and growth the first month (from a small B to a large B sometimes C).
46	917	I was on microgestin and if my breast tenderness continues I might have to request to switch back.
46	918	Now I almost always have breast tenderness that starts up to 2 weeks before I'm set to take the placebos, and this is incredibly uncomfortable.
46	919	The only side effect i have experienced this far is some slight breast tenderness, but nothing too bad!
46	920	I am definitely experiencing the breast tenderness & enlargement.
46	921	I was very scared reading the reviews on this birth control before taking it thinking it was going to make my fibromyalgia flare up as well but not so many changes except for breast tenderness.
46	922	Right now I have mild breast tenderness but honestly it isn't bad at all and I'd recommend it to anyone.
46	923	I immediately got a yeast infection upon starting it (maybe coincidental), however I'm not prone to yeast infections.
46	924	I read about it online and it does cause yeast infection as a side effect to some people.
46	925	I also developed what seems like a yeast infection but worse!
46	926	I can usually treat a yeast infection in a couple days with garlic clove and plain yogurt no problem but I'm still in hell thanks to Tarina Fe.
46	927	The first week into taking this pill, I got the yeast infection side effect and I've never had one before.
46	928	It also caused all the good bacteria in my stomach to wiped out, so I would get at least 1 vaginal Yeast Infection a month.
46	929	The one and only side Effect I had was a yeast infection, but it could have just been a coincidence.
46	930	I am on my third month and have had reoccuring yeast infections since being on this.
46	931	In that short span of time I've had THREE yeast infections.
46	932	I switched to a Mirena IUD for 6 months (gave me horrible yeast infections and I literally had my period for 6 months).
47	1	I had occasional headaches and broke out with a lot of acne.
47	2	It did not give me acne and my periods were short and light with minimal cramping.
47	3	Constant breakouts and painful acne.
47	4	This one has worked wonderfully for me and I have had no issues with acne or mood swings like I have with others.
47	5	The Gineress made me extremely nauseous all day long and gave me horrible acne after only one month which I never had before so even years later I was reluctant to start taking birth control again.
47	6	Then I started getting my period the last week of my active pill and acne all over my chin.
47	7	I was put on it for acne but also to prevent pregnancy.
47	8	I feel fine, no acne, no weight gain, no nausea.
47	9	My boobs are huge and hurt so bad and I have horribly painful cystic acne all over my face and chin and neck.
47	10	I was on trinessa back in November or so and it worked fantastic for me, cleared up my acne, no nausea or any other side affects.
47	11	When I started  I felt nauseous all the time, my boobs hurt, stomach pains and cramps, and worst of all my acne.
47	12	I never used to get cystic acne, but now I get it all over my mouth, chin, forehead, and under my nose, I hate it I keep reading reviews, and it's freaking me out.
47	13	I also asked to be on a pill that will help clear my moderate acne and not make it worse.
47	14	The only negatives are that I get headaches and occasional nausea (not severe) and as far as my acne, it hasn't really made a change.
47	15	I've been on this pill since January (it is now July) and sadly I've developed cystic acne from it and now I'm on accutane.
47	16	I took this pill in the first place for my acne only.
47	17	I was someone who had moderate acne and this cystic acne has made me so depressed.
47	18	Wish I could put pictures of my acne here :(
47	19	I have never gotten pregnant but my boyfriend and I take extra precautions and lately I have horrible acne and back pain
47	20	I initially went on this birth control to clear up my acne and it used to help my PMS symptoms but now they are back and just as severe, if not worse, and they start week 2 of my pack and last until my period starts.
47	21	I was getting bad acne before taking the bc and now my face has definitely cleared.
47	22	So I was originally on Junel fe but that was a horror show with all the mood swings, bleeding, acne and just horrible nausea.
47	23	I went on it to clear my acne and help with my extreme period sickness and it made both worse.
47	24	I also suffer from cystic acne and this made it even worse even though it's essentially a pill to clear acne.
47	25	This method was recommended by my gyno for normal contraception but also for my cystic acne that was out of control.
47	26	So far I've been on this bc for about two weeks and I can tell you I've actually seen my acne looking way better, and no bloating whatsoever.
47	27	I don't get acne, right before my period I might get a pimple or 2 but very minor.
47	28	My acne was also bad around my nose and chin before I started Previfem, but my skin is very clear and my period cramps aren't nearly as bad as they were before.
47	29	I have mood swings, I don't feel like myself, my acne is worse and I have a lowered sex drive.
47	30	My acne is now cystic and all over my chin and I'm left behind with red marks all over my face.
47	31	Had Othro tri cyclen lo for many years pharmacy switched to this generic prescription horrible spotting between periods, acne,bloating,hives,and missed period called Doctor to switch back my normal pill othro.
47	32	I was prescribed Tri Lo Sprintec to use for birth control as well as to help my acne.
47	33	It also gave me really bad acne even though I had only been on it for less than a week and a half.
47	34	Since, I've had no side effects, my periods are now lighter and shorter w/o cramps & my acne went away almost completly three months after.
47	35	Since I've been on this pill, my period comes very regularly, (I start the 7 green pills on Friday, it comes on Monday morning) my acne is good except on the period week.
47	36	I started bc when I was 15 for acne and I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo for about a year.
47	37	I woke up every morning sick to my stomach, I had no appetite most days, and my acne only sort of improved.
47	38	All helped with the nausea a little more, not too much with my acne, and a few made me very depressed.
47	39	No acne.
47	40	Never had acne, 3 day periods, no cramps, no bloating, and actually believed it was impossible to gain weight on it.
47	41	2 months in I've gained 20 pounds, horrible cramps, and have horrible acne.
47	42	I got on the pill to help with acne and cramps.
47	43	My acne is better.
47	44	Ive taken Ortho Tri-Cylen Lo, Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Trinessa and Tri-Sprintec and had no issues for adult acne.
47	45	It controls the hormonal acne I used to get on my jaw and makes my periods light and much less painful than without it (I still get cramps the first day).
47	46	I have tried tri-lo-cyclen and tri-lo-estraylla but this works great for acne and birth control.
47	47	Since switching, I have gotten horrible acne and I never had acne before, even as a teenager.
47	48	Made me anxiety go out of control,  dizziness,  nauseous,  migraines,  acne, breast pain, fatigue... etc etc.
47	49	I have been on birth control since around age 21, originally for acne.
47	50	In no particular order, I have extreme irritability, extremely sore boobs, INSOMNIA, experienced my first panic attack, ZERO SEX DRIVE, vaginal dryness, and the worst acne i have had since age 13.
47	51	No acne, no mood swings.
47	52	Cystic acne, engorged and painful breasts, extreme mood swings, irritability, worsened hypoglycemia, no appetite, dead libido, HEAVY periods, horrible cramping, and headaches.
47	53	I have been taking this for almost 5years, and it has worked well for me, periods are normal and light, 3-4days, acne is not bad anymore.
47	54	HOWEVER... My periods have been heavier with bad cramps and acne.
47	55	Using for acne and hormonal reasons, works well for skin clearing and regular periods.
47	56	I have PCOS and my acne cleared up a little, but I gained 10 lbs.
47	57	Light periods, helped with acne and no weight gain.
47	58	I absolutely love the pill; it got rid of my acne and I never experienced negative side effects.
47	59	Since starting the generic, I have acne, depression, spotting in between periods, and headaches.
47	60	I got post birth control acne at its very worse!)
47	61	But my acne is not under control at all.
47	62	When I first started the pill, I definitely noticed some bloating and my breasts got very swollen and I even had a bout of horrible acne and very dry skin.
47	63	The medication has not had any impact on my very moderate acne.
47	64	I have taken gianvi, ocella, and ortho lo before and they all made me either extremely mood or constantly hungry, but this pill has actually made me less hungry, has helped with the small amount of acne I have and it has done it's job well as far as preventing pregnancy goes.
47	65	I had spontaneous zits on my face but no severe acne however with this birth control I rarely have ANYTHING on my face.
47	66	On this pill, my acne has completely cleared up and I have never gotten pregnant so I'd like to rate it pretty high.
47	67	On other pills in the past, I had various side effects ranging from bad acne to insane anxiety, but haven't experienced any of that with this pill.
47	68	I was on birth control for severe acne.
47	69	Sprintec gave me an extra cup size and reduced my acne.
47	70	I did notice immediate acne as well (I almost never break out and I had big cyst-ish looking acne on my chin, which was lame with my upcoming wedding).
47	71	My doctor recommended it to me for my acne and irregular periods.
47	72	I will continue using this pill and I recommend it to others with acne and irregular periods.
47	73	At the beginning my acne got worse and I wanted to eat everything.
47	74	After the 2nd month my acne totally cleared up but I was still gaining weight, when I went to the Doctor for a check up he noticed I was a bit heavier and thats when I got off it.
47	75	Ive been on it for about 4 months and ive noticed that my acne has disappeared , my sex drive is in the so so range, i lost 29 pounds , my periods are 2 days which is very light , in the morning i barely would like toast, because my taste for food has left me bout 64% , i would have a hard craving for water and certain fruits, i cant stand soda's or candy , i get aggravated very very very easy, when im at work i sometimes feel extra depressed when im alone or its raining.
47	76	Works as far as preventing pregnancy, shorter, on schedule periods, REALLY good for preventing acne, but HORRIBLE for weight gain.
47	77	Took this all throughout high school and I never experienced acne because of it.
47	78	Worst decision of my life, I'm cursed with acne that's covered my face, neck, shoulders, and back.
47	79	This is because a hormonal imbalance which I think acne sufferers should look into.
47	80	For the last six months or so my acne has worsened and I've been getting more frequent headaches.
47	81	A little weight gain but the acne has me reconsidering.
47	82	I have very bad hormonal acne and have been on Spironolactone for that issue.
47	83	This birth control has increased acne, and appetite causing me to retain water.
47	84	I had the worst breast tenderness and my acne got worse.
47	85	I just got through my first pack of Ortho Cyclen and have noticed a few side effects: increased sensitivity, vaginal dryness, spotting, and acne.
47	86	I had really clear skin and never any acne problems before starting this pill (except the occasional pimple around that time of the month), but now it seems as though my face breaks out every few days.
47	87	I am about to go on Tri sprintec which my doctor said it's just a little higher dosage so that's probably where all those other symptoms come from (nausea, mood swings, acne, weight gain).
47	88	Dont have any side effects, acne has disappeared.
47	89	I have been breaking out with acne on my chest and a few on my face.
47	90	Which I never had a problem with any acne before.
47	91	Well after the first pack my face has been breaking out throughout the month, my 2nd month my period was MUCH more painful (one of the reasons I went on BC to begin with) and I bled for almost a full week instead of my normal 4-5 days.
47	92	I was gaining a lot of weight for no reason, constantly bloated, breaking out, fatigued, suddenly depressed for no reason, spotting and even my period just starting for no reason!
47	93	I am also starting to experience hair thinning and inflamed pimples all over my chin and cheek area which was never an issue before, not since I took accutane.
47	94	Also, I've gotten a few stray pimples but nothing too concerning.
47	95	3 WEEKS out of month I am spotting or lightly bleeding with some bad ass cramps, I have my appt Thursday and I am ready to be done with this!
47	96	Sore breasts, horrible and I mean horrible cramps, and HORRIBLE mood swings!
47	97	Although, I never got cramps before and now I get some rough ones.
47	98	I have had horrible cramps and spotting.
47	99	How ever, I must say around the placebo week, I get so bloated, horrible cramps and headaches...otherwise, it's been great.
47	100	Still get awful cramps, period isn't regulated, and the worst part of this one, for me, is that I have gained nearly 10 pounds.
47	101	It was so bad the first month I spotted for a week and then got my period the next with horrible cramps and headaches.
47	102	I have tried different birth control pills and this is my favorite so far, it regulated my period from an everyday bleeding to a normal 3-4 days per month, I used to get really bad cramps to the point that I could not walk, I had to stay in bed for the first 2 days of my period, and this pill made them less painful,  I have always deal with anxiety so nothing change about it, never gain weight and it also took away my everyday headaches, recently my doctor decided to change them for cryselle which is giving me horrible cramps nausea and headaches with only 2 days of using it, I'm definitely going back to tri-Lo-Sprintec.
47	103	Helps decrease the intensity of my cramps.
47	104	I had switched to this pill after having adverse reactions to Paragard (bled EXTREMELY heavily for all but 5 days a month, anemia, nausea, horrible cramps, etc) and Nuvaring (persistent yeast infections).
47	105	I'll take my cramps over this pain any day.
47	106	But, on the bright side, my period cramps have gotten better.
47	107	When I wasn't on birth control I used to have to take ibuprofen so I wouldn't throw up from period cramps but ever since being on mono linyah I don't even feel the cramps really and the bleeding only lasts about 4 days- and it is pretty light.
47	108	i was scared to start Tri-Lo-Sprintec and when i did my cramps started to ease.
47	109	i don't use the bill for birth control, i mainly use it because of bad menstrual cramps and very heavy bleeding.
47	110	I was prescribed Ortho Cyclen to lessen period cramps, abnormal bleeding, and to prevent pregnancy.
47	111	It reduced my menstrual cramps.
47	112	I used to get extremely moody and emotional before my period and get super bad cramps and it has helped greatly with that but my period hasn't changed much otherwise
47	113	When I did, it would last 3-6 weeks with debilitating cramps & severe bleeding (bleed through a Super  tampon in a few hours).
47	114	Since starting this birth control; my period happens like clockwork, it only lasts 3-4 days, & the pain has practically disappeared, only light cramps now & then.
47	115	I have slight cramps during my period, but not bad.
47	116	I have never had such severe side effects with an oral contraceptive in the last 14 years (just turned 29); bloating, gas, 20lb weight gain, mood swings, still having cramps, and decreased sex drive.
47	117	Side note, it does a great job at preventing cramps and my periods were so light and non existent, I would sometimes forget I'm even on it.
47	118	My first period on the pill, I had horrific cramps, way worse than any I had ever experienced.
47	119	But now, month 4 its normal and not heavy at all, no cramps and its regular which is great now since I am age 40.
47	120	To start off, I never really had bad cramps or anything major and I definitely didn't feel anything after starting birth control.
47	121	I experienced problems with mood swings, irritability, anxiety (racing heart and anxious feelings for no reasons), depression, cramps, spotting, headaches, decreased sex drive, weight gain, breast/nipple tenderness and vaginal irritation.
47	122	I have had breast tenderness, and occasional cramps, few headaches.
47	123	On the placebo pills, I did have somewhat cramping and I continued to spot after a few days starting on the new pack of active pills which I did not like.
47	124	The only issues were period cramping and it made me emotional.
47	125	By the 3rd month I noticed my anxiety and abdominal cramping at all times of my cycle flaring up.
47	126	I was on loestrin, which didn't do anything for my extremely heavy periods and bad cramping.
47	127	and my periods are lighter than ever with minimal cramping.
47	128	The good for me: very effective when taken correctly, and light periods with bearable cramping.
47	129	Since then, my cramping has slowly subsided and gets less painful every month.
47	130	But besides only a little spotting and my first period was shortened and minor cramping, its working out fine for me!
47	131	Plus I'm spotting every.
47	132	At first I was experiencing spotting immediately after being an hour late of taking my pill.
47	133	No spotting in between.
47	134	I've been on this pill for about 5 months, I've been experiencing nausea , vomiting , bad pains in my right leg and my boobs have gotten bigger and I'm spotting more but bleeding less during my period.
47	135	i do have some spotting between periods but thats apparently normal for a little while.
47	136	Does induce some spotting prior to menstrual cycle but others works great with no other side effects.
47	137	No nausea, spotting, mood changes, whatsoever.
47	138	I started spotting as soon as I started the new pack and kept going through the month.
47	139	Then I got on the depo shot and gained 25 pounds with terrible spotting between periods.
47	140	I decided to give it a shot again & was given this as a generic alternative I like this better than microgestin, but I have been feeling extremely tired and unmotivated, experienced minor spotting during the 3rd week of hormone pills, and my vision becomes blurry from time to time.
47	141	I have noticed some spotting but overall it's great.
47	142	When my prescription ran out I went to Planned Parenthood and was recommended Aubra, which did not work out for me, I had constant spotting, it significantly decreased my libido, and made me gain about 10 lbs.
47	143	I take it at night and I noticed the morning after taking my first pill I had a little spotting and some nausea but the nausea went away after about an hour.
47	144	I was switched to Ortho-Cyclen when I began spotting on my old pill.
47	145	I spot regularly during the 2nd week of pills every single month.
47	146	Ive been on the pill for almost a year and the first three months my period was not regulated that after my period was regulated but i would spot 3 days before I had my period and I had no symtoms but after about 6 to 7 months I notice that my boobs would be tender almost all the time and that my appetite increase like I would be full after eating about 2-3 plate of food then like 30 mins to an hour later I would be hungry again and then I  gained weight maybe like 5 to 8 pounds over 6 months it works and I really dont have a problem with the symptoms cause I now got use to it and my sex drive has acually increased
47	147	I have been on it for 3 months now and I have spotted every month.
47	148	Every day since I started the white pills I've had a headache.
47	149	I started the blue pills today and my headache turned into a migraine.
47	150	I've been experiencing headache's for the past week and been very nauseated.
47	151	I have had a headache every day on this pill, sensitivity to light, nausea, and heart palpitations.
47	152	Since starting, I've had very increased anxiety, a dull headache every day in my temples, and restless sleep/resulting extreme fatigue.
47	153	I've been nauseous, unusually tired, had upset stomach, and/or had a headache several times a week, not to mention I've had light to moderate bleeding every day since I started.
47	154	The only positive is that it isn't giving me headaches and I haven't gained any weight so far.
47	155	I didn't even think about the damn headaches until I read through the comments because I too have had them, I've also had a low sex drive despite my husband & I always doing it, but my desire is not there.
47	156	Felt I was going to cry over silly things that wouldn't normally make me emotional, mood swings, increased anxiety, headaches, and increased agitation.
47	157	I did get a few headaches and nausea here and there during the first pack but again nothing too bad.
47	158	I have constant headaches and a migraine so bad, I went to the ER.
47	159	I get zero headaches and slight naseous and when I say slight it comes and goes on some days but never stays and nothing I can't deal with.
47	160	This generic birth control gives me bad headaches that make me so exhausted that I can't do anything.
47	161	However I have had some headaches and am pretty much hungry all the time but that's about it.
47	162	I was taking Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo a few years back and my Dr put me on this back in may 2016..i used as directed i have had a horrible experience with using this medicine...when i first started it i had headaches and nausea then I started experiencing spotting-Heavy flow then just when i thought the bleeding was gone it was back and a heavy flow and it hasn't stopped since.... i have been having shakiness, panic attacks, anxiety,depression and suicidal ideation,mood swings, loss of appetite,constipation...
47	163	I also had a bunch of other side effects during the course of taking this pill including: breast pain, headaches, nausea and major mood swings!!
47	164	The 1.5 months, since I have been on TLS, ALL of these negative side effects: Irritability, depression, weight gain, depression, headaches, lethargy...you name it, I have it.
47	165	I am on my 2nd week of this pill and have had terrible diarrhea, nausea, pelvic and leg pain, headaches,  frequent thirst and much more.
47	166	Gildess and Junel are also used to regulate hormonal migraine headaches, and they both helped tremendously.
47	167	So my doc changed me to Sprintec and immediately I was getting headaches and yeast infections continuously!
47	168	Since starting this I've had a bunch of symptoms I've never had on the other one like rapid heart rate, pins and needles headaches, and frequent infections.
47	169	I've been on it for about 2 months now and have had numerous side effects: Acne, increased insomnia, increased headaches, nausea, vaginal dryness and therefore painful intercourse, long period (lasted 9 days instead of the 7 you would think from the "off" week).
47	170	My goodness just in 3 days of taking the pills I have severe migraine, nausea, breasts are sore, hair loss, mood swings, I crave for food mostly at night time, face was covered with bumpy white heads esp my jaw area which I don't get any at all.
47	171	From lack of appetite,mood swings (also a anxiety attack while taking a class,NOT GREAT AT ALL);zero sex drive & migraine.
47	172	On Monday, I got a migraine.
47	173	By midnight, my lips and nose were tingling and I still had a migraine and chest pain.
47	174	I switched to this pill because the old birth control pills gave me chronic migraines.
47	175	I also got migraines once a week from the start of the pill until I finally decided on changing it.
47	176	I gained 20lbs and changed NOTHING with my healthy eating habits, my migraines got so SUPER BAD I had to get a MRI to make sure everything was okay.
47	177	I also experienced some migraines but those only lasted 2-3 months as well.
47	178	For the last year and a half on the medication I had unbearable migraines all day, 7 days a week.
47	179	On Friday morning, I told my best friend about migraines and she told me to stop taking it because the same medicine caused her blood pressure to be elevated.
47	180	Since then my mood around the time of my period has settled, but I get debilitating migraines consistently every month the first day of my period.
47	181	During the two months that I've taken it, the migraines I got during my period were nothing short of debilitating.
47	182	I also have migraines, which I take Topamax to prevent, but with the Previfem they were coming nearly every other day.
47	183	Now my nausea is gone and I get occasional migraines.
47	184	This pill has stopped my migraines after I have been getting them since I was about 2 years old.
47	185	My sex drive was nonexistent.
47	186	Been using this for a month and my sex drive is dead!
47	187	No hair loss, loss of sex drive,  or nausea.
47	188	In addition, I am so nauseous, lower sex drive, and very moody.
47	189	I get extremely nauseous/throw up hours after I take the pill (even if I eat before), I feel lightheaded and dizzy, sex drive has definitely decreased and I am losing weight.
47	190	It also made my sex drive literally non existent.This is the worst thing that I have put in my body.
47	191	But after a month and a half of  taking Tri Lo Sprintec..I've noticed depression,  fatigue, crazy mood swings like NEVER BEFORE, dry mouth, decreased in sex drive, nausea, sore breasts..
47	192	My sex drive has even gone down, and I used to be insatiable.
47	193	On top of my mood swings, I cramped a lot and my sex drive was non-existent.
47	194	I also noticed a slightly higher sex drive.
47	195	The only thing i didn't like about it is that it gave me mood swings and lower sex drive.
47	196	I've also become very moody and have no sex drive.
47	197	I've also experienced low sex drive, intense food cravings, and vaginal irritation.
47	198	I lost my sex drive completely!
47	199	Definitely no change in sex drive.
47	200	Sex drive has been greatly decreased as well as experiencing dryness.
47	201	The low sex drive I have experienced on this has been very bad.
47	202	Then Estarylla, which my OBGYN and pharmacist assured me was the same exact drug, except I immediately lost all sex drive after taking it.
47	203	I don't mean a slight decline, I mean absolutely zero sex drive.
47	204	Horrible nausea, zero sex drive & I felt so bloated all the time.
47	205	I've been on this birth control for almost a year now and I've gained about ten pounds and sex drive has decreased.
47	206	My only use of contraceptive working great on that part but I'm thinking of changing due to my weight gain and decreased sex drive.
47	207	It has decreased my sex drive to absolutely zero.
47	208	I was on Lo estrin  prior and that made me feel a little moody and emotional and  brought down my sex drive as well.
47	209	The pill definitely hasn't bothered my sex drive either.
47	210	Not only was I sad, irritable and experienced low libido.....but I felt restless and nauseated from the hormones.
47	211	I did take FE microgestin 1/20 a few years ago & stopped because that made me lose my libido, gain weight, and just feel dead inside.
47	212	The bad for me: terrible mood swings, bloating, very low libido, and nausea.
47	213	My only symptoms were constant bloating, weight gain (15lbs in 7 months), and a constant insatiable appetite.
47	214	Mood swings are more severe, experienced a 10 lb weight gain, feeling considerably more anxious, extreme breast tenderness among feeling nauseated a week prior to period start date.
47	215	I had great skin, my periods were very regulated and short, I had some weight gain (I am skinny and did want to gain weight, so if you don't want weight gain I wouldn't suggest this).
47	216	No intense cravings, no mood swings, no nausea, no weight gain and no depression.
47	217	But what I think was the worst was the weight gain.
47	218	I haven't experienced any weight gain, as long as you control your appetite.
47	219	Otherwise it lighten my period, didn't cause breakouts or weight gain.
47	220	Helped my hormone levels balance out without weight gain, bloating, or any other bad stuff.
47	221	I've had some weight gain, too.
47	222	I hesitate to blame birth control for weight gain, but I've never gained weight like this before.
47	223	First of all, weight gain wasn't a problem..
47	224	At 16 I went on the pill, I was on the ortho tricyclin for about 3 years with no problem aside from small weight gain... suddenly I had gotten my period for 2 months straight!
47	225	The most undesirable side effect it had on me was the tremendous weight gain.
47	226	No weight gain.
47	227	It didn't cause weight gain, cleared up my skin but the mood swings mono linyah caused is almost out of control.
47	228	At first I really enjoyed this pill, no significant changes at all, no weight gain, no moodiness, no appetite change.
47	229	I'm underweight and struggle with weight gain but this pill has helped me put on pounds.
47	230	Not to mention the weight gain!
47	231	For me, the positives are that I've lost the weight I gained on tri-lo sprintec and I am no longer bloated all the time.
47	232	Also I haven't gained several pounds because of it.
47	233	I gained 20 pounds during that time.
47	234	I started taking this in Feb of 2017 and it is currently May, I gained over 20 pound.
47	235	I've also gained between 5-10 pounds that I just can't get rid of.
47	236	I also gained 8 lbs in a month now I am extremely active and eat healthy so this was unpleasant.
47	237	Ever since I was put on this I have gained 10 lbs in 3 months (which I haven't gained/loss more than 3 lbs in over 5 years).
47	238	I've also gained 5+ pounds.
47	239	Acne level isn't bad either, haven't gained weight either.
47	240	However, I gained about 30 lbs over a course of 6 months.
47	241	The only reasons I'm not 100% in love with it are because I have gained a noticeable amount of weight since taking it (10 pounds is a lot when you only weight 115 to begin with) and my periods tend to last around 5 days.
47	242	I gained ten pounds in the four weeks I was on the pill, and I also became very depressed.
47	243	This birth control did not work for me because I gained 10 lbs within 2 months of being on it; diet and exercise couldn't even take it off.
47	244	I have experienced bloating, but haven't gained any weight.
47	245	I've gained about 15 lbs in the 8 months I've been on it but that may not be the pill's fault.
47	246	I actually thought that I was pregnant because of my mood swings and the fact that gained 10 pounds.
47	247	I literally gained almost 20 pounds when I started taking this.
47	248	The only difference in my body image is that I have gained a cup size and my butt has gotten bigger, but my weight is the same so I have no problem with that!
47	249	I had daily nausea that felt like morning sickness all day every day.
47	250	Had to miss 3 days of school and work because nausea was so unbearable.
47	251	It has helped , but I'm am experiencing bad stomach issues; such as nausea, stomach pain, and throwing up!
47	252	I have the worst nausea all day and am so tired all day long.
47	253	I will stick out the nausea and breast pain and continue on month two, but if it continues, it is not the right birth control for me!
47	254	The first pack caused some nausea, a small break out and just an odd feeling.
47	255	I also experienced constant nausea and dry heaving to the point that I would have to pull off the road when driving to throw up.
47	256	It was the usual..low-moderate nausea, a couple of head aches & of course, I became very emotional.
47	257	The nausea subsided about 2 months after first taking it.
47	258	It caused severe mood swings, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, and shakiness for a week.
47	259	Extreme nausea and regular vomiting were also lovely side effects I experienced.
47	260	None of these symptoms except for occasional nausea, so I took it at night to remedy that.
47	261	I still get a pimple usually when my period starts and have experienced some nausea here and there.
47	262	When I first started taking this pill I had severe nausea when I would start a pack.
47	263	As for everyone else who has been experiencing these symptoms, they are also very common when you PMS, except for the nausea but mainly I think it's psychological.
47	264	I am usually nauseated and I SPOT A LOT.
47	265	Since I've been on this pill I've had terrible mood swings around my period, the first week of every pack I feel nauseous and throw up usually once or twice.
47	266	I was nauseous the first 2 weeks and a couple days it was absolutely miserable!
47	267	I would become so dizzy when I was nauseous that all I could do was lay on the bathroom floor.
47	268	I get nauseous for days after so i assume it could be pregnancy.
47	269	I was terribly nauseous for the first week or two.
47	270	Like, unbelievably nauseous.
47	271	The first month I was nauseous and dizzy, my thoughts started feeling fuzzy and I could feel myself turning into an angry person.
47	272	My breasts are also sore, and I find that I become nauseous no matter if I take it with food or not.
47	273	In the beginning I was very nauseous but after a month or two I felt great.
47	274	When I was on the patch, I felt nauseous and weak and it would never stay on my skin for the entire week, so I switched to Ortho Tri-Cyclen.
47	275	I can say that it helped stabilize my mood, I experienced no major mood swings or outbursts.
47	276	I had major mood swings, lost a lot of weight, got really depressed and felt like a total different person.
47	277	As far as mood swings I don't see a change in my moods other than usual.
47	278	My mood swings are crazy as well .. constantly irritated.
47	279	I think I only experienced mood swings during the first few months of taking this.
47	280	About a year ago, looks like they changed their inactive ingredients dramatically, adding many new chemicals to the mix, including something called Titanium dioxide.. With this new "formula" I noticed extreme weight loss (especially on face, boobs and butt), anxiety, mood swings, and just general malaise (all probably from the new preservatives they added in there).
47	281	It hasn't caused me to have random mood swings or irregular bleeding either.
47	282	My first couple of months on it I did feel little different - kind of anxious and more mood swings but that went away as I continued to take the pill and my body adjusted.
47	283	As many others, I was taking Ortho tri cyclen for 5+ years and stopped when I wanted to see if it was affecting me mentally (anxiety, mood swings etc.)
47	284	I've noticed mood swings but did not know what was causing them , this pill causes me to CRY for any little things its liks my hormones are all out of wack.
47	285	In addition to this, I have been experiencing crazy anger & mood swings for the first time.
47	286	I would constantly have 4-5 painful bumps on my face and they would take weeks to go away.When I first started this pill I immediately noticed extreme mood swings.
47	287	I'm still on this method and still have bad mood swings - I think I've gotten used to just being grumpy.
47	288	I was tired all the time, really bad mood swings & in pain, pretty much 3 weeks out of the month & this has been going on for years.The 1st week on Trinessa, I was tired all the time, bloated, feeling intense feelings of hunger & a bit emotional, although nowhere near as bad as my PMDD usually is.
47	289	My only problem was really intense mood swings for about the first two weeks, I felt so sensitive about the littlest things.
47	290	I was on tri sprinted for awhile and I thought it was such a great bc that didn't cause me to have anxiety or mood swings ... until I received the scary news that I had a blood clot in both of my lungs, the clot caused permanent damage to my lung and should have killed me.
47	291	BUT i have noticed mood swings tremendously and being extremely emotional when my period is coming
47	292	I can say the mood swings involved with this pill were miserable to deal with.
47	293	No mood swings, no breakthrough bleeding, no depression or breakouts.
47	294	It's so expensive but definitely worth it if it makes these mood swings go away.
47	295	Mood swings galore and a period that lasted more than 7 days.
47	296	My mood swings are out of the world!
47	297	The triphasal birth-control pills have been a lifesaver for me to help control my bipolar disorder for over 20 years   Off them, I have horrible mood swings and other symptoms like insomnia around ovulation and before my period.
47	298	I've had the worst anxiety and mood swings.
47	299	I decided to finally get off because my mood swings were getting worse.
47	300	I never experienced bad mood swings.
47	301	My periods used to be irregular and painful with heavy mood swings but now my periods are very regular and I can't feel them almost at all.
47	302	But my mood swings are extreme.
47	303	I've been having mood swings like crazy and I'm never ever happy.
47	304	I used to have very bad mood swings, but even that has changed a lot.
47	305	My mood changes in an instant and I've had several breakdowns and severe anxiety which almost never happens to me.
47	306	My insurance recently switched me to tri lo marzia and while I’m enjoying this pill, (weight loss, less of an appetite, no bloating), it is causing some major mood changes.
47	307	After reading the mostly awful reviews about it I was really nervous to start taking it but I thought I'd give it a shot and if it was awful talk to my doctor about an alternative.
47	308	I was nervous to start this after reading such horrible reviews!
47	309	It really made me nervous I just called my dr today to switch it to something else I've only been this uncomfortable was in my third trimester :(
47	310	The week before my period I became  even more crazy, and depressed and anxious.
47	311	I was noticeably irritable and extremely anxious.
47	312	I regret this, because just a few days into the medication, I am once again anxious, grumpy, and miserable.
47	313	I went off of it after 3 days of utter torment, anxious paranoia and feelings of extreme shame and guilt.
47	314	I have had severe anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember and I was just starting to be able to manage it on my own.
47	315	I felt constant anxiety, depression, paranoia and moodiness.
47	316	I have been taking tri-lo-sprintec for over a year now, but in the last 4-ish months, I've started to get worse PMS super bloated, tender breasts, exhaustion, and mild anxiety and lack of motivation, even for my favorite sport, rock climbing.
47	317	Also EXTREME irritability and anxiety.
47	318	Then the anxiety started setting in, and I felt detached from reality.
47	319	I have never had symptoms of anxiety or depression apart from normal stress and a bit of sadness after giving birth to my kids.
47	320	Also was very sluggish, depressed, & had very bad anxiety with this pill.
47	321	I now experience insomnia, anxiety, and lethargy.
47	322	i felt fine my first pack and the right into my second pack i started to get anxiety attacks out of nowhere.
47	323	I started getting the worst anxiety I have ever had at the bed of the first week.
47	324	This pill caused me to become severely depressed and developed extreme social anxiety.
47	325	Not depressed anymore and anxiety is finally getting better.
47	326	I stopped taking it because of the side effects - I could have stuck it out through the breast tenderness & mild breakouts, but the exhaustion and depression have been getting worse over the last two months so I stopped the pill.
47	327	Great for preventing pregnancy also causes breast tenderness towards end of pack.
48	1	I got really bad acne, my face was always oily no matter what I did.
48	2	However, my acne and mood did a complete 180.° I felt erratic and couldn't understand why I was suddenly an emotional wreck.The entire second year, I had my period for 9 out of the 12 months.
48	3	Although it doesn’t make me breakout more than average, I have to say that the acne that forms is worse.
48	4	On the implant, it seems that I only ever get cyst like acne which is a lot more painful and takes longer to go away.
48	5	I have acne and I'm always tired some days.
48	6	So far I've had a little bit of random acne appearing on my face , and I've been feeling a bit bloated .
48	7	No sex drive, minor acne , NO PERIOD , moody , back pain, sore throat, flu like symptoms that go away within a day.
48	8	It cleared up my acne.
48	9	I was on it for 2 years and 4 months.. everything was fine for the first year then after that I slowly started to get acne 1-2 spots every day for that year.
48	10	Then the last 4 months of being on it I started to get so many white heads around my cheeks and jawline & it started to make the acne  soo bad like 10 pimples every where every day.
48	11	I had happy moments and really angry moments on it , I started getting acne on my face which I'm not use to , my anxiety was off the roof and I gained at least 15 pounds which I didn't need considering I just had a baby at the time!
48	12	However, about a month in, I began getting mild chin acne.
48	13	It's been three months since and not only has the acne on my chin worsened, but it has now started aggressively forming around my eyebrows.
48	14	I have NEVER had acne in my life (I'm 22) so this has been absolutely horrible.
48	15	Periods can be irregular, but I simply can't live with the acne.
48	16	So I had to remember to take daily medicine anyway, and I've never had acne before.
48	17	I suffered from mood swings, depression, low sex drive and acne whilst having the implant.
48	18	So I've had my period has always been hell cramps like crazy, insane mood swings, and horrible acne.
48	19	I've tried almost every birth control pill on the market and all of them have either not been effective in stopping my period or have made my acne worse.
48	20	I have experienced no weight gain, irregular bleeding, or acne while on this.
48	21	I've been on this implant for about a year I absolutely hate it I weighed 120 after having my baby I was so small my doctor told me I would only gain about 5 pounds, I am now at 199 I've tried losing weight that doesn't work my acne is out of this world I barely get a period and when I do it last for like a day and a half!
48	22	never really had a problem with gaining weight or acne.
48	23	Also, I did get break outs on my face from bad acne from time to time.
48	24	I loved everything about the implanon - BUT I had to have it removed because it gave me horrific cystic acne deep under my skin around my chin.
48	25	If you do find you start to experience cystic acne on the implanon - DO NOT TOUCH IT and get your doc to prescribe a topical acne ointment to save yourself from it spreading and causing scarring :(
48	26	I did not gain weight, but I did have very severe acne, to the point of (ineffective) dermatologist visits.
48	27	I've have no weight changes and no acne.
48	28	So I went for the bar in my arm as doctor told me same hormones as the depo (ya right) 6 months I have this in my arm and have gained 2 stone, feel crap about myself terrible outbreaks of acne (never even had spots as a teenager) and feeling low and depressed and periods every two weeks!!!
48	29	Also I have noticed the only side effect for me is when I'm going to start my menstural I'll develop a little bit of acne otherwise great method and I'm going to renew it for another three years.
48	30	I gained 20 lbs (on a naturally thin, 5'4" frame) and, even worse, cystic acne (on formerly clear, normal skin)!
48	31	I had two with no problems apart from acne.
48	32	It completely changed my appetite, gave me horrible acne and dandruff and reduced my sex drive to nothing.
48	33	I gained about 15lbs, started getting a little acne (never had acne before that), and I had a period about twice a year (light, lasted a week).
48	34	A month later I started experience HORRIBLE acne, mood swings and more weight gain.
48	35	My acne has calmed down a lot in the past 6 months but I now have a lot of scarring.
48	36	It gave me insane acne on my face and back, terrible breast pain and swelling, the most extreme mood swings, increased my depression and anxiety x1000, gave me headaches at first, and completely wiped out my sex drive.
48	37	No weight gain, no acne, best of all no bloating!
48	38	I noticed that ever since I got it I started to get pretty bad acne which I had never really bad in my face chest and back!
48	39	But after I got this I had constant breakouts and even worse cystic acne under the skin which is extremely painful!
48	40	I'm getting it removed tomorrow and i hope it atleast helps me start to get rid of this acne
48	41	Then I started getting depressed, gained 7 stone throughout the years I have had it (on and off by dieting), depressed, unmotivated, tearful, low sex drive, acne, I've got severe acne scarring on my back, face and chest and even feeling suicidal at times and constant, heavy painful periods.
48	42	And it gave me acne like all the time.
48	43	I have had breast pain, acne, etc.
48	44	I also have been breaking out NONSTOP since Christmas, my acne has never been this AWFUL.
48	45	Not to mention the cystic, painful acne, the hair thinning, constant painful breasts, horrible mood and yeast infections.
48	46	After having it in for a month I then had my period for over 30 days straight, developed terrible acne, felt bloated and sick most of the time, and had constant cold symptoms.
48	47	I have terrible acne all over my face, chest, and back.
48	48	My acne wasn't even close to being this bad ever not even when I was going through middle or high school.
48	49	I have never had acne and I did not develop acne so that was great.
48	50	The final straw has been that I've developed terrible cystic hormonal acne on my jawline that won't go away.
48	51	I began getting acne and gained 20 lbs rapidly.
48	52	I have constant acne that I did not have before the insertion and it does not respond to prescription strength treatment.
48	53	I was getting acne but blame smoking.
48	54	have had it in for almost a year, first few months were okay, but it's gradually got worse, I'm constantly on my period, I've got acne, I'm tired, I've gained weight & it's impossible to shift.
48	55	The bruising and swelling I had was ridiculous, not only need I get long stripes of bruising on my arm and lost feeling I also woke up the next day not being able to open my right eye (my implant is in my right arm) within 3 weeks I started to get a few spots which developed into acne I also gained around 14lbs and now deal with anxiety and minute depression.
48	56	I ALWAYS had perfect skin & now I struggle badly w/ acne so this could have been a side effect.
48	57	I did notice getting more acne and irritability for about two or so months after it was implanted but now my mood had evened off and my skin is back to what it was before the implant.
48	58	I am 20 yrs old when I initially got it inserted  waited a month for unprotected sex with my bf to make sure it's effectiveness, everything was great the first 8-10 months I stopped getting my period and most importantly the implanon was very effective, no weight gain, when I reach about a year/year and a half I started getting acne which I've never experienced before, at the time I didn't realize it was the implanon until I started researching, my period started coming VERY irregular, it lasts months with a 2-3 break, made it very uncomfortable to even want to have sex.
48	59	So over all it does prevent you from getting pregnant and its very effective but keep in mind these side effects!I only regret it bc of the mood swings,acne, period duration
48	60	I've had a small bout of acne but it seems to be disappearing now.
48	61	It's been 2 months and overall my experience has been positive.No period or spotting just a few acne break outs here and there.No weight gain or crazy appetite.I barely eat and i don't habe mood swings .
48	62	Did get acne and have put on weight not sure if the inplanon caused it.
48	63	I had my birth control implant since February 2015 and my face had broken out so bad, face acne and worse back acne.
48	64	When I was on the pill I came out in terrible acne, I had none with this implant.
48	65	Horrible headaches, acne, fatigue, and atrocious mood swings!
48	66	I experienced mood swings, anxiety, depression, gained about 10-15 lbs over the 7 months, a bit of acne, and generally was just very 'hormonal'.
48	67	It had caused me to have weight gain, tiredness and bad acne including cycstic acne which I never had before.
48	68	Now after 7 months of having it inserted, I have gotten a lot of acne on my face that I never before have gotten and I get mood swings.
48	69	The only thing with the replacement is ive had a bit of acne.
48	70	I am getting more acne than I've ever had though.
48	71	I use to experience nausea and back pain now i just have headaches, dizziness, Extremely long menstral cycles, cycle has lasted almost a whole 3 years.No sex drive, Mood swings\depression, hair loss, and i get soo tired that i feel like i been ran over and acne.
48	72	I have had no noticeable side effects like weight gain and acne.
48	73	I get these crazy headaches and HOLY SHIIT I have never had acne before and now I have it and it's bad.
48	74	Some previous acne did resurface which I now take roaccutane for, working brilliantly and have no complaints.
48	75	I've also never had acne before, and now I've been having major breakouts constantly.
48	76	I had bad acne growing up but my skin cleared.
48	77	But what really bothers me is after a year of having implant, I started having cystic acne,that no matter what you do it doesn't go away, I haven't had any pimples during my teenage years, before I got pregnant and after having two kids, but recently they just keep popping up.
48	78	I have the worst acne I've had since I was 13.
48	79	Very good but caused cystic acne!!
48	80	Very horrible acne!!!
48	81	I went 3 years but got it again..it works well other than acne.
48	82	I have not gotten the bad acne, weight gain ( I'm actually losing weight!)
48	83	Oh, I forgot about acne.
48	84	I've always had bad adult acne, so I haven't noticed that side effect.
48	85	My skin was clear of acne, I did had a little facial hair growing but I dismissed it (thought it would be better than getting pregnant).
48	86	I've gained weight (I've never had a healthy diet though) I've gotten even more facial hair and the acne is like I'm in high school again.
48	87	I've never had acne, and now I can't get rid of it no matter how much medication I use.
48	88	PLUS don't forget about the acne that never goes away, no matter how many times you wash your face lol.
48	89	Severe headaches, permanent 5 year long period with a small relief each month, acne, hormonal problems, severe abdominal pain, my kidney stones were nothing compared to what the doctors thought were ovarian cysts bursting (its a side effect, another no one knew/told me/made info accessible).So much they don't know.
48	90	My acne will not go away no matter what I try to use.
48	91	I developed acne on my chest, shoulders and head, bloated, mood swings, excrutiating lower back pain.
48	92	Within 3 months of having it, I developed horrible acne around the jaw line and forehead with cysts on my lower jaw.
48	93	With Implanon, I lost 40 pounds, which I attribute more to diet and exercise, developed acne, but had no breast tenderness, periods or mood swings.
48	94	To me the terrible acne isn't worth it so I got back on Zovia.
48	95	And my acne cleared up.
48	96	I used to never get acne on my back and barely on my face but this caused me to get acne horribly.
48	97	No mood swings, so weight gain, and no acne either.
48	98	I have had acne and blackheads.
48	99	My acne got worse sadly.
48	100	It was so hard to not gain weight, hopefully now it will be easier, no acne thank God.
48	101	No acne or moods,  but still crave my chocolate
48	102	No mood swings or acne.
48	103	No weight gain or acne for me.
48	104	I have not got any acne.
48	105	My downsides: I never had acne previously and I now have it really bad, i gained about 45 lbs, and I have horrible mood swings.
48	106	(I'm on prescribed acne medicines now) but overall no pregnancy.
48	107	I had it for 3 years and it didn't get me pregnant but I did gain 30 pounds and acne problem started after a year.
48	108	I never had weight gain, mood swings or pain but at the end of the 3 years, for a few months I did get sever acne, depression and weight gain.
48	109	The two and a half years without periods or the worry if I could get pregnant is worth the few months of acne and weight gain.
48	110	The downside is I am always tired, I have mood swings and acne.
48	111	They caused me to gain weight, go in and out of depression, have horrible mood swings, acne, everything that could go wrong did.
48	112	The only side effect that I am having is acne not just on my face but on my neck and back as well, other then that out works great.
48	113	My breasts got swollen and my face breaking out, I have some acne, losing weight is good part but sex is getting very uncomfortable and painful but I still recommend it.
48	114	No acne, no negative side affects, just pain in arm time to time but nothing major
48	115	To me acne weight gain is not a problem and I never got pregnant having sex.
48	116	I hadn't had my period yet, and after the insertion, continued to not have periods for a whole year (up to today) no mood swings, no acne, a really great birth control!
48	117	Along with that I have had a non existent sex drive, severe weight gain, acne, depression, anxiety, hormonal and hair loss, getting it out in 2hrs!
48	118	In nov 2012 I was also diagnosed with pcos which caused acne, hair growth, painful periods, and infertility.
48	119	Had acne in place I didn't know you could get it.
48	120	Not pregnant, so it's effective but ever since getting this I've noticed horrible mood swings in the first year, major loss of sex drive and now I've had horrible acne on my cheeks for about 8 months.
48	121	You may get some acne.
48	122	I only experienced slight acne.
48	123	The ONLY complaint that I have is the spotting; I've had no weight gain, no increase in acne, no mood swings, etc.
48	124	I have not gotten pregnant or had the burden of taking a pill everyday but since I've had it inserted I have gained about 15 lbs and developed really bad acne on my face and body.
48	125	No acne and it actually helped me lose weight.
48	126	So far I've had bleeding (spotting) constantly since I have had it in, which is so annoying, slight weight gain and acne.
48	127	My acne is up and down.
48	128	So I haven't had a pregnancy and its actually cleared almost all my acne.
48	129	I haven't had weight gain, headaches, my acne has gotten pretty bad but mainly around the time to start.
48	130	I'm on a lot of acne medicine already so if it did increase acne I didn't notice.
48	131	I had not weight gain, no mood swings, and no acne.
48	132	No acne.
48	133	I have always had acne and oily skin so it is hard to say if it effected that.
48	134	I have never had acne like I have experienced with Implanon as well.
48	135	I would be able to deal with the acne if I wasn't bleeding for weeks.
48	136	I have not had any noticable weight gain or mood swings due to the Implanon and even less outbreaks of acne since starting it.
48	137	and I fear I've had many of the other symptoms and just never thought Implanon could be a reason for moods, headaches, sore breasts, extreme weight gain and acne.
48	138	However, I think acne is a tiny issue, nothing major; my skin seems oily but this could be from the summer heat.
48	139	The 2 bad things that are causing me to want to get it out is the acne and weight gain.
48	140	I had acne when I had the Implanon put in and it cleared my acne up.
48	141	I have had bad acne and some long periods like 2 months at most during the first year but now I'm starting on year 2 and the bleeding has gone to normal and well the acne I control it with tea tree oil.
48	142	Yes you get discouraged with the bleeding and the bad acne but just have patience and it will go away.
48	143	I've had slight weight gain and a little acne problems.
48	144	While I have experienced some side effects small acne problems (minor) and I am longer getting my period, I am happy with other aspects of Implanon.
48	145	The plus side to it, it made my skin so beautiful, I didn't have acne for the first 5 months, but I'm starting to see acne starting to pop up more often and weight gain.
48	146	I was really worried about that one and my skin looks the same- still no acne.
48	147	When I was on the patch I had NO problems, no weight gain, VERY regular periods, no acne.
48	148	My skin also changed, I have never had a problem with acne and now my forehead is oily and constantly breaks out, as does my back.
48	149	No weight gain, no acne and no mood swings or hormonal changes.
48	150	I have not had any negative side effects except acne, but that is common with anything that is changing your hormones.
48	151	I gained weight, I broke out in acne so bad it was ridiculous, I had hot flashes, and now I'm noticing severe mood swings...like I'll just be depressed for no reason.
48	152	Developed Cystic acne, mood swings, crampand constant headaches, and severe depression.
48	153	Placement was a breeze, I had headaches and mood swings for about 2 weeks after placement, acne breakouts for about 6 months, light periods, but no other side effects.
48	154	I took Oracea for 2 months and that took care of the acne, it has not returned.
48	155	I have less acne, I have not had a period for 7 months which is GREAT, and I have not gained more weight.
48	156	Since I've had it I haven't gone for more than 2 days without spotting, will have a heavy period for up to 5 weeks, migraines, muscle pains, joint aches, acne, incredible mood swings, will cry for no reason, extreme anxiety where everything around me goes hazy and I feel like I'm moving in slow motion, my breasts constantly ache and I've gained about 35 pounds.
48	157	I still have my sex drive (increasingly so) but I've gotten a little acne and I've gained about fifteen pounds.
48	158	I have got Implanon inserted about a month and a half ago and I have no weight gain or loss no acne and my mood has been pretty normal or so I think.
48	159	I get slight acne on my forehead and my breasts grew a little.
48	160	As someone else mentioned my hair also broke off in the middle - my mother has also noticed it, depression/very emotional sometimes for no reason, anxiety, no sex-drive, slight acne, felt down in the dumps/sad, no motivation, fatigue, dermatitis of the skin on my hands.I was in a relationship that I am in no longer.
48	161	But I also have never had acne, gained weight or anything like that.
48	162	However, after Implanon I have had a GREAT increase in acne.
48	163	I have experienced terrible acne while on Implanon and weight gain.
48	164	I've had no mood swings or changes, no acne, no weight gain, none of the dreaded side effects from most birth control pills.
48	165	I had no acne, very light periods lasting 3-4 days, no weight gain, no mood swings, nothing.
48	166	I now have horrible acne, I have gained about 15 pounds, I have bad mood swings and my periods are absolutely terrible.
48	167	Around four months I started to get acne, something I never had in high school and my periods came randomly.
48	168	I haven't had ANY negative mood swings, any weight gain, any acne or food cravings.
48	169	I had Implanon inserted a year ago and the only side effect I have experienced is acne.
48	170	I never (even as a teenager) had acne, only the occasional pimple every few months, however with Implanon I%u2019m always breaking out.
48	171	It is such a convenient form of birth control that I can live with the acne.
48	172	No acne no weight gain, libido has not changed, no cravings, no mood swings.
48	173	I did get some acne due to the Implanon but after a couple of weeks it went away.
48	174	I had not stopped bleeding once, I gained 25 pounds, I had severe depression and severe acne.
48	175	And I did get acne...a lot of it.
48	176	I also developed moderate acne after never having it (even in my teens), gained 30 pounds, and developed major depression and anxiety.
48	177	I haven't noticed any weight gain, but I did notice that over the summer months I had for the first time in my life, back acne.
48	178	The one thing I do hate is the fact that I have never had acne in my life until now.
48	179	And I have really bad acne.
48	180	My face and back break out with acne since starting the medicine and the insertion site is still itchy.
48	181	I am a teenager and I wanted a birth control that didn't cause weight gain, a daily reminding of taking a pill, no mood swings or acne.
48	182	I never had acne, now I have it on my back and face.
48	183	It has indeed prevented pregnancy however I have suffered awful side effects including: moodiness, weight gain, painful acne, nervousness, nausea, headaches, eye tenderness, ever flutters as if I'm pregnant.
48	184	I've noticed quite a bit more acne than usual but that may be because its a hot sweaty summer.
48	185	I have new acne of my face daily, hair loss, and sore breasts (especially in the morning).
48	186	I experienced mood and acne.
48	187	My sex drive is the exact same, I haven't fluctuated in weight, no mood swings, no change in acne.
48	188	The only side effects I did not like was I got really bad acne, not just on my face but on my back and chested as well.
48	189	The only bad thing is I had a slight increase in acne, it is subsiding now.
48	190	I have had Implanon for over a year and absolutely loved it for the first 8 months, then the acne started.
48	191	I have not experienced any weight gain, or acne.
48	192	The only bad part about the birth control is that I have very bad mood swings, and my acne comes and goes and I have gained weight and I go to the gym every night but no changes// uggggh.
48	193	I also have acne, mood swings, and bloating all the time because I'm constantly on my period.
48	194	Weight gain, low sex drive, acne, depression, mood swings, headaches, and crazy periods....
48	195	I have had acne problems, but I ended up getting some nice face wash.
48	196	Over the last year I have had problems with extreme fatigue, backaches, joint pain, difficulty sleeping, and horrible acne.
48	197	All side effects include acne (which I only had at the beginning of a menstrual cycle before), hair loss, bad mood swings, depression, weight gain, migraines, stomach problems, excessive bleeding.
48	198	No acne or any hormonal changes.
48	199	I haven't had any weight gain, nausea, depression, or acne, but my bleeding starts out heavy and then gets lighter.
48	200	I also noticed that I began to get headaches, back pain, abnormally irritable, feet swelling, and constant acne breakouts.
48	201	I now have cystic acne on my face and am having to spend loads of money to cure it, because it has gotten so bad.
48	202	No acne and not even a scar from it.
48	203	I have not had a period at all, however, I have had some bizarre side effects which have become unbearable, including acne, weight gain/bloating, mood swings and feelings of depression.
48	204	I had depression, mood swings, period for 6 months straight, cyst in right breast, pelvic pain, edema, fever, headaches, back pain, joint pain, weight gain, acne, and the list goes on.
48	205	I haven't noticed any severe change in mood or weight, however there was an increase in acne on my face and on my back (which I've never had).
48	206	I have started to have really oily skin on my face which has caused acne but nothing I can't handle.
48	207	In five months I have gained 25 pounds, I am VERY irritable, I had amazing skin and I am now developing acne.
48	208	Implanon has not affected my skin or weight gain/loss or acne.
48	209	I have bad acne, moodiness and gained 30 pounds.
48	210	Bad mood swings no sex drive, acne everywhere lots of abnormal discharge headaches lower back pain tired all the time.
48	211	For the last 2 years my face and back are like teenager's with constant acne like breakouts but, I have to say the security it gave was worth it all.
48	212	I have experienced some weight gain, but no acne.
48	213	The only good things were it helped my acne and I didn't gain any weight.
48	214	My acne is a little harder to control now that I'm on Implanon, but its not bad.
48	215	I had pre-existing acne and so far it's actually cleared up my face!
48	216	This surprised me since I thought it might make it worse, but I guess it can actually improve acne in girls who had it prior to insertion.
48	217	I've had no weight gain, but I have had a lot of acne and lower back pain.
48	218	No sex drive, increased vaginal discharge, acne ....did I mention I've been bleeding for 6 months!
48	219	No weight gain or acne though.
48	220	My acne is terrible since I got this birth control.
48	221	I lost hair, gained 50 pounds, acne, facial hair, mood swings, fatigue, slept most of the time, no libido, just plain MISERABLE.
48	222	I have a bit more acne than before and I think I've gained a little weight, but all-in-all...
48	223	I have gained 10-15 pounds since getting Implanon and have acne, mood swings, and I have bad moments where I don't even recognize myself.
48	224	I do have acne now, and weight gain (but I would bet that's from other lifestyle changes also).
48	225	I got acne which I never had in my life and I'm 33.
48	226	I have not gotten acne, or cramps, or moods or anything, although I may have a little headache once in a while, but nothing else.
48	227	Since then I've experienced weight gain, depression, acne outbreaks and periods that last up to 5 weeks.
48	228	I have no sex drive either and have had more acne in the past 2 months than I have ever had in my life.
48	229	I have terrible acne break outs, I have had constant bleeding the whole time.
48	230	However I have constant headaches, acne, mood swings, weight gain (over 40 lbs!).
48	231	I also got acne and have had my period twice since I got it.
48	232	After I 1st got it, I was period less for 3 months, and since then, my period comes every 4-6 weeks for about 5-7 days, but no weight gain, mood swings, or acne, until 1 or 2 days prior to my period starting, so I just chalk it up to PMS.
48	233	Also have horrible acne.
48	234	), and another had it removed due to bad acne.
48	235	I started loosing hair, my hair became greasy, my skin began flaking and breaking out.
48	236	I noticed I started breaking out a lot more than usual.
48	237	Also I started breaking out on my forehead with clogged pores that I have never dealt with before.
48	238	I also have trouble with breaking out a lot, mood swings, and a non-existent sex drive.
48	239	I have had the implanon now for 2 years in the beginning everything was good, the last year I have been suffering from horrible aniexty attacks not sure if its because of the birth control or not, I have been breaking out like crazy!
48	240	The first two months on the implant I notice that I was breaking out more than usual , I was very tired and also had a very huge appetite and cravings for seafood.
48	241	My main concerns were, the weight gain, breaking out, the spotting, and the sex drive.
48	242	The only negative is my skin is breaking out as if I'm a teenager going through puberty again.
48	243	For the last three months this has calmed down some, however I have started breaking out like a teen all over again.
48	244	Negative part is gaining weight and breaking out a little.
48	245	I have been breaking out really bad since I started taking this and its only been in for a few months but my face looks horrible and because of the breakouts I am starting to feel very down and not wanting to show my face because it's just way too much to deal with right now.
48	246	I've been breaking out really bad and experiencing very bad mood swings.
48	247	Not only that but I started breaking out on my body and on my face as well.
48	248	I also have severe back pains and am breaking out.
48	249	Since then I will randomly get upset or mad and have recently been breaking out a lot which is not normal for me.
48	250	As soon as I got off it I haven't gotten any pimples since, no hair loss and I don't eat like I did on it.
48	251	I had occasional pimples and black heads.
48	252	My face broke out in NASTY pimples on my face chest and back.
48	253	I keep getting random little pimples all over my face.
48	254	The reason I love it is because Implanon has cleared my face from pimples and blemishes.
48	255	I have so many zits my face it hurts.
48	256	No sex drive, horrible attitude towards EVERYTHING, anxious, horrible cramps.
48	257	Then for another month or so I would get heavy heavy periods with cramps that made it so hard to get up from bed.
48	258	I got my implant April of 2016 I have to tell you that even though I don't have headaches or cramps I have to tell you that my mood swings have been all over the place I don't like being up and down constantly depressed crying angry paranoid anxious.
48	259	I barely get headaches and cramps (only a little cramps to indicate my period was coming) No weight gain either!
48	260	I do occasionally get a bit of spotting, but never had a full blown period or any cramps.
48	261	Irregular periods for a while (boo), zero cramps (yay!).
48	262	I didn't get periods at first , and if I did they were very light , then 4 months later I got the worst periods I've ever had, usually before the birth control I could help my back pain & cramps with IB,  IB didn't even help AT ALL when I got on birth control.
48	263	My periods & cramps aren't too crazy,Ive gained some weight but im not too sure if it has anything to do with this.
48	264	It's just all over the place, with extremely painful cramps.
48	265	Before the implant I have had cramps and sever back pain with each delightful time of the month, before I had no problems with my cycle but now it is unpredictable.
48	266	The implant hasn't improved the cramps and back pain but overall the effects of the implant is better than being pregnant.
48	267	I usually have a heavy flow without cramps.
48	268	I didn't have a period until recently and im having severe cramps.
48	269	Now i barely have a period at all, and it completely got rid of my awful cramps!
48	270	I have had this since April 2015 and it's great before the implanon I was irregular, heavy periods with awful cramps that wouldn't let me walk right sometimes.
48	271	The rod in my arm didn't regulate my periods but I have it every two or three months for two or three weeks and the cramps are nowhere near that bad as before.
48	272	My period lasts three months at a time with cramps, head aches, and is harder to lose weight.
48	273	No periods anymore though just PAINFUL cramps.
48	274	I had the implanon put in in 2014 and I loved it, I have not had my period since then and very rarely get cramps, although now when I look back I realised my anxiety got worse and my depression also got worse.
48	275	For example the IUD gave me unbearable mensural cramps, something I never had prior to the implant.
48	276	I would get horrible headaches and cramps, not to mention nausea and light headed.
48	277	The biggest issue I have with this birth control is the non-stop random bleeding the lasts for months and the horrible cramps.
48	278	2 days ago I started experience sharp stabbing cramps and today have spotted a little.
48	279	Okay so I got the implant for two reasons: I was terrible at remembering to take birth control and my menstrual cycle every month used to be AWFUL (heavy bleeding, terrible cramps, committing, and heacaches).
48	280	I don't have a period anymore which I'm not complaining but I still get the cramps and they are worse than they used to be.
48	281	It was great for the first year besides sometimes irregular periods it really helped my period being so heavy.The bad right around a year I gained around 15 pounds,I started looking almost as if I was pregnant by my stomach,I would have a period for a couple months then not one for two or  three months, my cramps became terrible and my bloodsugars were highly elevated even taking very high doses of insulin also I have high cholesterol now at age 22, not to mention the terrible mood swings and depression along with the almost like pregnancy cravings and Ovarian cysts which are very painful.I want it out now!!
48	282	Got the birth control inserted in November of 2013 I had very badddd cramps the next month for 4 days afterwards no cramping or bleeding!
48	283	I'll wake up with really bad cramps or lower back pain and I feel I'm emotionally weak sometimes and cry for literally nothing, its taken its toll I think I'll take it out soon!
48	284	I've been on implanon 2 yrs this month got it 6 weeks after giving birth.only reason I haven't had it taken out is because I don't want to get pregnant and I'm not sure what other birth control would be best for me.Ive tried the pills before and immediately broke out in hives but since being on implanon my periods are way heavier,periods before implanon were 3-4 days now it comes and goes when it feels like.always have random spotting sometimes for a whole months my painful cramps turned into contracions.mood changes everyday for no reason and I have a very very low sex drive .which was never the case before this .no weight gain which i was hoping for .randomly get nauseous.
48	285	Some mood swings but not bad always hungry gained like 40 pounds but I have no period no cramps.
48	286	Around the same time I started getting really bad cramps, and before the implant I had never gotten cramps in my life!
48	287	still trying to decide if the bi-weekly cramps and long periods are worth it, but odds are I will resort to traditional birth control instead.
48	288	The first full year I would get painful menstrual cramps, whether I was on my cycle or not.
48	289	I get cramps rarely, no spotting.
48	290	My periods are really lite and occasionally get cramps.
48	291	I never get a period but have the worst cramps I've ever had in my life around every 3 months.
48	292	I've had one period and no cramps what so ever.
48	293	I get horrible cramps .
48	294	Now I don't get my period which is great but I have extreme pain and cramps.
48	295	No cramps which was good.
48	296	Just starting to get PMS symptoms back each month - bloating, sick, teary, cravings, cramps.
48	297	Lately I've been feeling sick having cramps.
48	298	And had cramps.
48	299	Spotting came and go and cramps got worse!
48	300	This time, I've started getting bad cramps and heavier periods so I think it's time to try something else.
48	301	I had light spotting at first then a year in I had this horrible wreck of a period lasted three weeks, very heavy and then another year no period until a month ago wham wrecked all my clothes and undies its a nightmare cramps are very painful.. my boyfriend and I have discussed other pregnancy prevention because this is just not good, ive not been able to work..
48	302	I get cramps as if I am about to but either don't or just get very small spotting.
48	303	I've had the Implanon for 6 months now - light periods and occasional cramps - but aside from that no bad side effects!
48	304	I never have gotten cramps before I got this put in and they are the worst.
48	305	I did get really bad cramps one month but other than that I haven't had any side effects.
48	306	When I first got this birth control I didn't get my period for a couple of months but then all of a sudden I started getting heavy periods and bad cramps.
48	307	I had it with everything like cramps, mood swings and a heavy flow.
48	308	I've experienced a confusing period but its a lot less than before I got it as well as less cramps.
48	309	I have periods every other month (light flow but the worst cramps).
48	310	I do however get everything that comes with a period, the cramps, mood swings, all the emotions, everything but the bleeding at least once a month, as if I were on my period.
48	311	I got it put in because my cramps were excruciating and my periods were irregular as ever.
48	312	Still have period cramps.
48	313	My cramps aren't bad at all but the bleeding time can get annoying.
48	314	Since then no bleeding and cramps were tolerable.
48	315	My periods were heavy, irregular, my cramps were painful it was truly an awful experience.
48	316	I loved this birth control because it completely got rid of my period, and cramps.
48	317	On the pill, I had awful cramps and would spend days in bed, on Implanon, cramps NEVER bothered me.
48	318	Yes I've gained some weight but the cramps and mood swings are gone!
48	319	coming from someone who used to have cramps so severe and bleeding so extensive this was heaven, until.. the "spotting" happened (over 7 months later) I had heavy bleeding for weeks.
48	320	I get cramps once in awhile but that's about it and I never once got pregnant on it!
48	321	I get no cramps or fatigue.
48	322	I do have sharp back pain and cramps including mood swings basically everything that my body would do if it was "pregnant" like the OBgyn explained.
48	323	I used to have really heavy periods with awful cramps and fatigue.
48	324	I don't get spotting for months at a time or even cramps, every once in a while I do but at lot less then I used to.
48	325	The cramps have been awful, periods are super unpredictable- for example I had a 4 week period, then nothing for 5 weeks, then 4 day period, nothing for 2 weeks, then 6 day period.
48	326	I've had Implanon since November and I've only had a couple of periods, NO cramps or PMS.
48	327	I don't get cramps anymore and I wrestle with my kids and my boyfriend and I never notice the implant at all.
48	328	My side effects are cramps, headaches, depression and sore breasts.
48	329	But, in my experience I've had no period so far and no cramps or PMS symptoms.
48	330	The first 17 months was awesome, no bleeding (at all), & no cramps.
48	331	The only bad thing is that I will get severe cramps about every month to two months.
48	332	Very light, no cramps or anything with a regular period, only light bleeding.
48	333	I have been fine (no cramps, not tired, no weight gain, etc.).
48	334	I don't have any of the period pain I used to (Headaches, horrible cramps) and I am much less moody as well (I used to burst into tears on the spot).
48	335	The two times the bleeding slowed down to spotting she had horrible cramps after intercourse and started bleeding again.
48	336	2 weeks in I started spotting for a month and now its been 9 months no cramps, weight loss, no mood swings and I have a light period for about 3 days a month.
48	337	I had my period one about every six months which left me with horrible cramps.
48	338	My hair fell out, I developed asthma and chronic bronchitis, and I had terrible cramps and bleeding twice a month.
48	339	I still get the odd period cramps but that's it!
48	340	I'm not moody at all, no cramps, bloating, and for once no weight gain!
48	341	Nausea all the time, breast tenderness, moodiness, bloated, sharp cramps, etc.
48	342	headaches and cramps but nothing compared to what I would be use to.
48	343	For the last month or so I've had the worst cramps I've ever had, my breasts hurt constantly, and still having vertigo and nausea.
48	344	I did have much side effects, such as: heavy bleeding, horrible menstrual cramps, and low sex drive, but in all honestly every woman is different.
48	345	The period is heavy and the cramps are unbearable.
48	346	I feel bloated, constant cramps, tired all the time, and gained 15 pounds.
48	347	I also had mood swings, extreme headaches, and stomach cramps.
48	348	That's right, for 6 years I've had irregular periods ever since, no cramps and no headaches but different experiences with sex drive with both implants.
48	349	I do experience horrible cramps though, which I never had before the Implanon and mood swings accompanied by a bit of depression.
48	350	I have not noticed any side effects other than my periods only come every other month and last for 2-3 weeks at a time, but the flow and cramps are really minimal from what they used to be.
48	351	I used to have terrible cramps when being on my cycle, and although Implanon did not make my cycles lighter it did lessen the pain a bit.
48	352	The only side effects I have noticed is that my menstrual cramps have increased slightly.
48	353	The bleeding has gotten so bad lately I have to make sure I have panty liners in just in case and the cramps seriously feel like I am being stabbed.
48	354	When I was on it before I never had cramps, only had slight bleeding for 3-4 days.
48	355	My only complaint would be that while on the pill my cramps virtually disappeared.
48	356	Since being on Implanon, my cramps have returned however not as strong!
48	357	I have very painful menstrual cramps which I can't even stand straight.
48	358	While the Depo gave me very painful cramps and painful bleeding and the ring and pills made me severely sick.
48	359	And now 3 months into my 2nd Implanon I am getting side effects: constant light bleeding (2 months so far), tender breasts, cramps, mood swings and depression...I loved it the first time and still recommend Implanon, but this is just a wake up call that it's not for everyone...and the way your body reacts can change!
48	360	Even though I had a lot of bleeding, I stopped getting those super bad cramps I would get.
48	361	Anyway I wasn't bleeding but was suffering with severe cramps most of the time and my boyfriend was very concerned so I went back on the pill and couldn't seem to settle, so went back to family planning where I was told the implant had been improved so I opted to try it again.
48	362	I must admit I get the odd bit of spotting and stomach cramps which can be painful, but I now wonder if this is an age thing that as you get older you can suffer more as I definitely wasn't like this in my early 20s.
48	363	Started having cramps, heavier periods, and bad mood swings.
48	364	During that time I am miserable with back aches, constant cramps and lots of nausea.
48	365	Now that I have no period I have really bad cramps.
48	366	The pros: I don't have to remember to take a pill everyday, I can have sex anytime and not worry about pregnancy, I NEVER have cramps anymore, my periods are very light and only last a few days.
48	367	I have always had really bad cramps when I got my period, but when I got the Implanon it went away.
48	368	Since then I haven't had a period or any spotting or cramps.
48	369	I had previously suffered from severe PMS and had horrible cramps, fatigue, and back aches, but now, I have none of that, probably because I haven't had a period except once.
48	370	Severe stomach cramps, headaches, discharge, no sex drive and I need to take the pill everyday anyway so I don't bleed constantly!
48	371	I do have some cramps but no period after a month.
48	372	There are no mood swings and menstrual cramps last about a day.
48	373	I had so many problems with my periods before, and cramps so bad I had to miss work!
48	374	Nothing but a spot or two once a month and no cramps!
48	375	I have not had any noticeable side effects, except maybe some menstrual cramps that I didn't have before, and some itchiness where it is inserted.
48	376	Terrible cramps, so bad I can barely walk at times.
48	377	I gained weight, my moods are crazy and I wasn't very nice before so defiantly not good, and i get random cramps and either a long period or none at all, NO SEX DRIVE!
48	378	My moods have actually stabilized and I no longer get random menstrual cramps throughout the month.
48	379	I have been having some serious cramps that don't feel like period cramps or even close.
48	380	The main reason I decided to get Implanon was to stop my awful cramps each month.
48	381	Since insertion I haven't had a period or cramps.
48	382	My cramps are worse, my mood swings are outrageous.
48	383	I've got to wait a week until they can remove it and put a new one in, but the stomach cramps are now really unbearable.
48	384	But I will still be having another put in since the cramps are apparently down to it running out.
48	385	I have a 10 day period every 1 1/2 months, my libido is up, I haven't gained weight (if I have it's from overeating) and I don't have cramps.
48	386	Super bad bleeding with the worse cramps ever or spotting still with cramps.
48	387	The things I experienced were very heavy bleeding, cramps and not just normal cramps the worst I've ever felt, spotting, pain during intercourse, mood swings, and loss of sex drive.
48	388	I noticed no severe cramps, or mood swings at first.
48	389	After 3 months of enjoying my Implanon a bad period came, with VERY bad cramps, constant breast tenderness, and as my boyfriend says 'severe jerkiness', that lasted for a month, and it has just ended.
48	390	I don't usually have cramps but the last 2 times I bled I was in severe pain.
48	391	I have had times where my period came for 2 1/2 months and really bad cramps.
48	392	No trying to remember to take a pill every day...Only downfall I've had is that I get cramps when I'm supposed to get my period but it never comes.
48	393	Although I did still have the cramps and PMS.
48	394	As I was coming up on the 2nd year, just two months before, I did have a period that was full of heavy bleeding and painful cramps.
48	395	Other then that I have not gained any weight, have had no major mood swings, it almost completelly eliminated my cramps and back pain ( which was very severe before ) and my boyfreind and I are able to have a very good sex life.
48	396	I no longer get cramps as I used to get all the time.
48	397	I have my period all the time now  twice a month, very tired and severe cramps.
48	398	I have crazy mood swings, cramps and I am very irritable.
48	399	I have gained 15lbs in 7 months, very depressed, moody, bad cramps, headaches, muscle aches, weakness, digestive problems.
48	400	However a week after I got it my period came, bleeding, cramps.
48	401	My only complaint is that the cramps are a little more intense then before I got it.
48	402	The only bad thing is that my back cramps and headaches have gotten worse but it may just be my PMS.
48	403	Add on menstrual cramp.
48	404	I had constant mood swings, weight gain, constantly on my period, terrible headaches and awful cramp.
48	405	I love the convenience but thanks to this site I am scheduled for a comprehensive medical test because Implanon appears to have given me unexplained headaches, fever, leg cramp, arm numbness, general body tiredness, terrible mood, very sore nipples, bloating, weight gain (I went from 72KG to 82 Kg) and hypertension (I started drinking coffee excessively to keep awake in the office).
48	406	My positive very convenient birth control, regular period, no cramp.
48	407	I did cramp as though it was trying to come.
48	408	My cycle comes every 3 months and last about 7 days, the other months I may cramp a little but no spotting so far.
48	409	I run random fevers and I cramp bad at certain times.
48	410	Boobs constantly hurt, always cramping, migraines, exhausted everyday, mood swings and zero sex drive.
48	411	As of today (mar 2017) I was cramping all day, low and behold I started my period.
48	412	Great for not getting pregnant; however, awful for cramping and irregular periods, sometimes lasting for a month.
48	413	Then I get one and I have pretty bad cramping but really light bleeding.
48	414	im 2 weeks in and i just want to know will this help me gain weight, i was currently on depo and switched to nexplanon thinking it will make me gain , i cant really tell yet , the only i experience is the cramping , but i take pills for that, but other than im fine so far,
48	415	Although its a great BC, I have had no weight gain or mood swings which I like but I do not stop bleeding it's so irregular I still have no pattern I am currently stuck in a 2 week period and starting to get bad cramping.
48	416	I have my period every month right on time but it is much lighter and there is no cramping.
48	417	I get cramping for a week out of it.
48	418	I had no more periods or cramping but I did have mood swings.
48	419	Also cramping in between periods.
48	420	My doctor told me nothing could completely fix the horrible periods and cramping I was going through.
48	421	I took the pill for three months back to back as recommended by my doctor when I first had the implant put in and only had a light period  (but heavy cramping) in the week I came off the pill.
48	422	Since then until now I haven't had any bleeding, spotting, or cramping.
48	423	But when I got it replaced back in October I have had cramping to were it wakes me up at night because the pain is so great, I am tired all the time, and I have gone from 140 to 196 in a year...
48	424	Once my year mark came along I've been experiencing on & off spotting.. Now coming up on my 2 year mark I've been bleeding & cramping heavy.
48	425	In addition, I bled every day for a the month I had it in (heavy bleeding and cramping).
48	426	Suddenly I began having spontaneous and HORRID periods, extreme cramping, bloating, swelling.
48	427	I also experienced cramping and  bloating sometimes, started to gain weight after three month gained 5 kg in three month, some mood swing (but not too bad) I've got it removed of course.
48	428	It wasn't awful, no cramping or heavy bleeding.
48	429	I've had mine in since November 2013, it is now May 2014 and I get my period every 4 weeks, for 2 weeks of heavy bleeding, cramping and headaches.
48	430	I have literally been cramping for a week straight, I have no appetite, and I'm also nauseous.
48	431	I was warned by my doctor that when my period comes.....it can do almost anything, be light, heavy, cramping or none, bloating or none, skip months, shorter or longer periods, periods lasting 1-2 months at a time, stopping and starting of blood flow during a period .....just anything...so be prepared for anything ladies...good luck!
48	432	I only get my period every 3 to 4 months with minimal cramping although it is a heavy flow.
48	433	No pregnancy, I actually lost weight, I had a monthly "period" which consisted of minimal cramping and being moody, yet no bleeding.
48	434	So even though I'm terrified at the thought of having another child right now, I couldn't handle the constant bleeding, cramping, headaches, etc.
48	435	No regular heavy periods, no cramping, no hormone mood swings or weight gain.
48	436	I had it originally because I was told I would no longer have a period which meant no cramping.
48	437	Acne, sore breast and mild cramping but regardless its very helpful because I don't have to do anything like worry about missing a dose.
48	438	No cramping.
48	439	Since then the one thing that I noticed, and so has my twin sister, the more sex you have, your period will return with the cramping and all!
48	440	No cramping or PMS either!
48	441	Ever since I haven't had cramping, mood changes, weight gain, acne..anything, and it's been a month from insertion.
48	442	No weight gain, mood changes, or cramping during my period.
48	443	No cramping no crazy mood swings, like my doctor said everybody is different.
48	444	I have not had a period since, and have had minor cramping, but this is normal for my body, was the same when I was on the pill.
48	445	I for the first time in my LIFE can say I have light periods, minimum to no cramping, zero mood swings and my sex drive is normal!
48	446	The first two years on Implanon were wonderful, no periods, cramping, or other symptoms.
48	447	They've been heavy periods and the cramping sucks.
48	448	I also have cramping, nausea and dizziness.
48	449	Only bad side effect is some cramping from time to time.
48	450	I've noticed immense cramping and backache, fatigue and moodiness.
48	451	Bad:extreme cramping, random cycles and weight gain.
48	452	I actually lost weight (appetite) and haven't had headaches, cramping, or loss of sex drive-all of which make me love it.
48	453	Got some cramping and low libido, but I can live with it.
48	454	I've also had cramping and bloating with it, which I hadn't experienced in almost 20 years until now.
48	455	Occasionally I feel like I am cramping.
48	456	For the next six to eight months I had a period every 1.5 - 2 months and for only 3-5 days with minimal cramping.
48	457	The last portion of the 3 year cycle though it's become more like 1 full, or almost full period every two to three weeks, cramping elevated but still not what it used to be without any birth control.
48	458	I was recently hospitalized for four days because of severe cramping and bleeding.
48	459	Mild cramping, its all spotting.
48	460	I am closing in on the halfway point of having this in and I do get quite a bit of dark spotting and irregular periods now with cramping like I used to get when I was on no birth control.
48	461	I don't have any cramping, but each month around the time for my period, my body sends me that signal.
48	462	The length of the period is long, and extremely heavy with cramping!
48	463	My periods usually last 3-5 days and I am now on day 8 of heavy bleeding and cramping.
48	464	I'm cramping nearly everyday, I have had nausea, hair loss, mood swings, weight gain, zero sex drive.
48	465	I'm nauseous, I get headaches, I'm tired, I have cramping, and I have mood swings.
48	466	I am very crampy and tired all of the time.
48	467	There may have been a bit of spotting here and there.
48	468	I would rather have a period instead of 2 days of spotting dark brown goo.
48	469	Then on off spotting.
48	470	Starting September 2017 having daily spotting for a month.
48	471	After that it was non stop spotting for a while.
48	472	She was either always on her period or spotting & she developed alopecia.
48	473	I have gained so much weight, I started to retain water and I have been spotting for the last month My  sex drive is usually insane but with the birth control I lost the my sex drive my skin took a tow.
48	474	I've had non stop spotting and periods all month, no energy, mood swings, depression, dizziness on a daily and I've been having tingling in my arm and legs but especially in the arm that the implant is in.
48	475	Then it quit for about a month with a little spotting in between.
48	476	No spotting.
48	477	Maybe 4 or 5 scattered days monthly with no spotting.
48	478	I've had no complications, not one period since having it implanted, not even spotting until this morning when I woke up I had bled everywhere, seems as though mine has run out?
48	479	Hopefully spotting dies down and I can be more intimate with my husband again.
48	480	I have had three periods in the space of 4 weeks which vary between heavy and continuous spotting.
48	481	After the implant was in my period lasted a few day longer than usual with spotting for a few days but it wasn't bad and I expected it I would say my period with the spotting lasted a week and a half but I'm sure that was my body getting used to the hormones.
48	482	Well I'm 3 months in I haven't had a period which I love I only spotted for about an hr the first time I missed my period ( it sounds crazy but it's true) I wouldn't even call it spotting it was so light.
48	483	After a few months, I have light spotting for maybe 3/4 days per month & it is painless.
48	484	Now I'm just spotting.
48	485	If it's not a heavy flow, it's spotting.
48	486	My periods before implant were always heavy and wk long....after implant they were inconsistent , spotting and then completely disappeared.
48	487	I don't have periods, just light spotting every now and then.
48	488	No spotting or bleeding whatsoever = awesome!
48	489	I do like it though I haven't noticed any major mood swings and I've actually lost weight not gained however there is spotting every once in a while but so much better then periods
48	490	But it has been light spotting since and each and every time I have sex a whole stream of blood rushes out.
48	491	I had it in for about 5 months and got my period twice on it (more like spotting for a week).
48	492	Had pretty much every side effect except weight gain and never ending spotting.
48	493	For the first two months i had a week or two of random spotting, with very light periods maybe once a month for 2-3 days.
48	494	The spotting has been on and off the whole time.
48	495	I would get my period for 2 weeks then another 3 weeks of spotting then it finishes then 1 week later I start pmsing again .
48	496	The 1st month was a 3 week light period and after that no period for 6 months but did get a light spotting period that lasted about 3 days the max.
48	497	I have gained almost 10 lbs, have less of a sex drive, feel like a crazy person, my hair stopped growing, and worst of all I have my period randomly with spotting alllll..... the time!
48	498	It's hard to have sex or want to have sex when you're bloated and spotting 3 weeks out of the month!
48	499	I got in on February  12 2016 .missed my period in march and been bleeding and spotting since  the 23rd of march and today  is April 17.
48	500	From then on it was spotting, and then regular 4 day periods (that was normal for me either 3-4 day periods) then week long periods, then a month late or 2 months late.
48	501	I spot all the time my period is normal and lasts for 4-6 days but it is followed by spotting a lot of spotting and I dont get a break and when i do its like 2-4 weeks and I start spotting for a full 2 months!
48	502	I bleed on average 25 days out of a month (most days straight was 22) Those 6 days I don't are mixed in the middle mostly two days at a time,  some even include spotting which I don't refer to as bleeding anymore.
48	503	Then out of nowhere I started getting spotting and mood swings.
48	504	I had it inserted a week or two after having my second baby and have only had two months where I have not been bleeding or spotting, and that was because they put me on birth control pills to "regulate" things.
48	505	Some days were heavy spotting, or light bleeding and the rest of the days were HEAVY & PAINFUL.
48	506	But it's only minor spotting.
48	507	Just spotting 5 days (total) within three years.
48	508	I am 20 & had no real side effects aside from the constant spotting at one point.
48	509	I bled 20 days of the month - mostly spotting but due to unexpected random heavy periods at completely random times I had to wear a tampon always.
48	510	The first month or two I had light spotting for a few weeks, then after that my period and any bleeding has stopped altogether.
48	511	No period at all except for a couple weeks a few months ago of random spotting.
48	512	It was not always heavy but there was rarely ever a day when I was not spotting or could not wear a pad.
48	513	I didn't get a period the whole time I was on it I had light spotting maybe twice a year for a few days randomly.
48	514	I am constantly on my period (spotting).
48	515	I go several months spotting with an occasional couple days off.
48	516	I've had it in for a year now I get occasional aches in my arm and spotting every once and a while but not enough to wear a tampon.
48	517	Recently it stopped for a few days and I have had some spotting just today.
48	518	My period reduced to 2 days with spotting for 5 days.
48	519	Had spotting for abt 5 months.
48	520	My period was really the main frustrations 1 month of spotting very light panty liner period.
48	521	I experienced a little spotting for the first 6 weeks which was normal.
48	522	Then spotting every 2 months before it completely went away.
48	523	I had maybe 2 or 3 days of spotting & after that nothing!!
48	524	I've had terrible breakouts, non stop spotting , loss of libido , and it's causing me to get agitated over ever my little thing.
48	525	I had this inserted purely for the fact I was over period pain (my family has bad ovaries so period pain is 1000x worse) I was aware there would be spotting and occasionally period, but jeez 7 months??
48	526	I haven't had any spotting.
48	527	However after about 6 months I felt as though I was losing weight, I had what felt like constant spotting, so my menstruation  never stopped it felt like and my libido was in over-drive.
48	528	For the first month I didn't have any spotting or period but when the time was due for when my usual period came around I started to spot.
48	529	The only downside of this BC is the spotting.
48	530	Experienced bleeding and spotting for a month and a half, but totally worth it because now I have no periods.
48	531	Not even spotting.
48	532	I had no side effects besides the spotting and rarely having any periods (had at least two actual periods within 7 months) I did not gain or lose any weight but I think since it is a long term birth control you never know when the side effects will kick in?
48	533	It lasted only three days, with light flow followed by a day of spotting.
48	534	My third period lasted three weeks but was still light and spotting.
48	535	I got my implant about 4 months ago, since then I've had really long and heavy periods, spotting for maybe 2 weeks then I might stop all together for about a week, start spotting then have the heavy, prolonged period.
48	536	I was weighing 140lbs when i got it and now weight 135, my skin has actually been looking better than usual and the spotting i have had is very little... And the sex drive has not changed...
48	537	I don't know if it's spotting or bleeding but I'll get my period, be good for a week then it comes right back, then be gone for a week and come back again.
48	538	My periods have now stopped completely, besides the odd month of spotting.
48	539	The only side effect I experienced is that my period stopped other than some light spotting once or twice in 6yrs.
48	540	Since then I've bleed for 24 days on end.. Light spotting which I hate.. Also my skin has begin to break out as well.. Not really big bumps but little annoying ones.. That keep popping up each day.. Makes me wanna go see my dermatologist again.
48	541	I haven't had any periods in the 2 years I've been on it, and only the rare light spotting (maybe 5-6 days in 2 years).
48	542	The first 3 months were okay, only 2 regular periods with occasional light spotting in between.
48	543	I now have constant, heavy spotting (including during my wedding in April, yes it was so much fun to make my maid of honor hold my dress while I REPEATEDLY changed my tampon, AT.
48	544	Recently spotting lasted for 6 straight weeks.
48	545	Initially Advil would stop the spotting (per my doctor's recommendation) but now nothing does.
48	546	I had very light spotting for the first couple of weeks, then it stopped so far.
48	547	I got the Implanon on April the 15th, and didn't bleed until 10th of May, when I started spotting.
48	548	But I have lost my sex drive, am moody and have had 7 months of spotting and bleeding.
48	549	After insertion (which hurt like hell) i had constant light spotting for 6 months.
48	550	I like the fact that I got my period the first to months even though it was just spotting.
48	551	3 weeks after insertion I started spotting and have been for about 2/3 weeks, it's very light and it is annoying but I'm hoping it settles down within the next month or so.
48	552	When I had my first one implanted in my left arm I did spot lightly for a little while just a few months, then I didn't have a period at all, or spotting, I love it.
48	553	Within the first 6 months I lost 11 pounds, my period was not regular and I had it for two months straight, lots of spotting also.
48	554	This is my 2nd Implanon, the 1st one I had took a few months for my body to settle had a bit of spotting 5 months then periods completely stopped.
48	555	Have not had my period the entire time not even spotting.
48	556	Well when I woke up this morning and used the bathroom I realized I was spotting.
48	557	I get spotting often and light but frequent periods, which is annoying.
48	558	Periods come around the same time every month and spotting occurs.
48	559	After sex I get some spotting each time.
48	560	I have been on this for about 2 years, I barely get any periods mostly just spotting, no weight gain, you don't have to think about it but every other three years, and it just goes in your arm.
48	561	No period for 3 months then spotting for one month.
48	562	After having it replaced the second time it's been less period all around light spotting.
48	563	For the first year and a half I had rare spotting but I gained about 15 pounds.
48	564	I just keep gaining and spotting all the time.
48	565	I have not had any periods besides a little spotting the first couple months.
48	566	I have random spotting and a very light period every 6 months or so.
48	567	I've had it in for 8 months now and only get my light spotting when stressed.
48	568	No light bleeding, no spotting.
48	569	Starting off being light(spotting) for a week or two, then stopped.
48	570	I believe after a good 6 months being on it I haven't had a period, spotting, nothing.
48	571	I have only had about six episodes of light spotting for two to three days in that time, so it's working as intended!
48	572	No spotting at all, very light and short periods although period pain has been a little worse than usual.
48	573	More like spotting.
48	574	I did not have a period for several months after getting it besides a few days of spotting here and there.
48	575	I just don't remember spotting as much the third year.
48	576	I haven't had 1 period or even any spotting since the day I had it put in my arm.
48	577	I will get a few months with no period, then maybe spotting for like 4 days.
48	578	I have only had spotting when I was extremely stressed, other than that, no periods, no mood swings, no side effects.
48	579	I have had Implanon since September 7, 2012 I haven't gotten my period since or spotting.
48	580	The first year could not have been better, no weight gain, no period whatsoever, no spotting, no moodiness, nothing!
48	581	I was apprehensive to get this a first, due to the possible side effects, but after insertion I had my period for 3 months with very light spotting in between and then they went away completely.
48	582	The only complaint I have with it is, spotting.
48	583	First year, I had a period or spotting for a month straight!
48	584	I have loved it the whole time except when I get spotting constantly.
48	585	(Usually there are only about 2 days of bleeding that are really noticeable but the other 5-8 days are just spotting on and off).
48	586	I look forward to the day when it is just a few days of spotting, or less.
48	587	I've had spotting here and there but nothing major at all.
48	588	I would say that the only thing I did not care for with the Implanon was the somewhat occasional spotting.
48	589	I would say that I got spotting about every other month and it would last anywhere from three to six days.
48	590	I have not gotten pregnant so it is doing it's job but along than the spotting.
48	591	I have had maybe 2 periods which was more like spotting in the last year that I have had it.
48	592	Also I haven't really had periods and when I do it's usually spotting and last for four to five days most of the time it doesn't show.
48	593	I had a mild period 2 months later that lasted most of the month & had light spotting on & off for the next 2 months or so & that was the end.
48	594	Only side effect I have noticed is spotting, normally just a little but it's constant.
48	595	But recently I had my period for about 4 days, it stopped for a couple days, and now I'm spotting.
48	596	I have not had a full period since that first month with only (extremely) light spotting every few months.
48	597	I started while on my period and just started slightly spotting.
48	598	I did notice the day before I started spotting I felt BLAH.
48	599	I felt like crying the whole day but The next day I started spotting and my mood was back to normal.
48	600	I did have the occasional spotting but not an actual period, that is until four weeks ago, I started bleeding, a week went by and it slowed down and just when it seemed to be over I started again.
48	601	Or spotting.
48	602	The first month I did have three weeks of spotting, which was rough.
48	603	But after that I have only had very minor spotting once a month like a period.
48	604	I had spotting for a few days the very next month, but I haven't had any bleeding or spotting since them.
48	605	The first few months were what I was told to expect, spotting on and off.
48	606	Since insertion on June 19th of this year I've had no period or spotting of any kind but keep in mind every woman's body is different.
48	607	I have mood swings and had 8 months non-stop spotting with  loss of sex drive all together.
48	608	I haven't had any spotting or irregular bleeding.
48	609	(Just spotting though), month after got a period around the same time, spotting only.
48	610	At that point I was spotting irregularly.
48	611	Always spotting.
48	612	I get a "period" every 3-4 months or so, and even then it is just 3 days of slight spotting.
48	613	A couple weeks after getting this put in I was spotting constantly for about a month.
48	614	During all this my sex drive had been dwindling, but I didn't want to take the Implanon out because I heard to try it for at least six months to see if the side effects would go away like the spotting did.
48	615	I had the Implanon put in February 2012 and it's been almost a month now and I've been spotting non-stop.
48	616	I had a very light period after having it inserted but the spotting drives me nuts!
48	617	I may have spotting every once in awhile but it is not often.
48	618	I did start out with a little weight gain and some spotting that wasnt quite light but not a period either.
48	619	I have not had a period in 3 months just light spotting and have not had a pregnancy scare.
48	620	No pain other than the first couple days and no spotting.
48	621	I haven't had any spotting either.
48	622	Then, about 7 months into it I started spotting, and my hair has stopped growing.
48	623	After 5 months of straight spotting and gaining 25 pounds my doctor wants me off of it ASAP.
48	624	I have had some spotting about twice, and discharge since inserted.
48	625	It's now Jan 13 2012 and I have not gotten pregnant but there is no way possible I could be pregnant because I have been on my period at least 3 weeks out of the month and the rest of the month I'm spotting.
48	626	On most days it's just moderate spotting however it does get quite annoying.
48	627	I had no period or spotting at all for the first two months.
48	628	Then, I began spotting lightly every other day or so.
48	629	90% of the time, the spotting is so light, there is no need for a panty liner.
48	630	I started spotting very lightly last week but it has not turned into a full on period.
48	631	I have not had my period since it was inserted, there was few spotting but it was not full blown.
48	632	They say in the packet that there may be some spotting but I've had my period for over 6 months on Implanon.
48	633	I had light to medium spotting.
48	634	I been on my period for 3weeks and 3 days I read some people comments and they said they had a period for a long time but only spotting, mines is like that but hoping it come off soon.
48	635	I have gained about 10lbs and I rarely ever quit spotting and when I'm not spotting I'm bleeding.
48	636	My cycle only lasted 5 days as usual, and there was no spotting for 2 weeks.
48	637	I will have heavy bleeding for about a week, then light bleeding for another week, and then spotting for another week.
48	638	Last month I started a week early and it was unusually light, this month I started 2 1/2 weeks early and it has been off and on spotting for the past 5 days.
48	639	On small negative though I have been spotting for about 3 1/2 weeks now.
48	640	I had Implanon implanted early September 2011 and had a little bit of spotting for the first 3 weeks and that was it.
48	641	Have not had a period or spotting.
48	642	The first Implanon was a dream: no periods, no spotting, no maintenance, insertion was easy, bone density returned after 8 years on Depo, no mood swings.
48	643	But I love that I have only had minor spotting, very little weight gain, and a barely noticeable scar.
48	644	I had spotting for the first 6 months which was difficult but I'm glad I stuck with it because I love not having to worry about my birth control.
48	645	I did have lots of spotting the first month after I got the implant and then the occasional spotting afterwards, but I've been spotting and period free for a few months now and it feels wonderful.
48	646	I have Implanon for about 5 months, no bleeding, only spotting.
48	647	I have had only 2 periods since starting and no spotting in between.
48	648	From the start, I had spotting/full period 3 weeks out of the month, then two months a year I would have zero spotting or no period at all.
48	649	Given, I've only had it in for just over 2 months, I have lost 30 lbs -post baby and I have spotted some here and there, but I personally would rather keep a liner in, in case of spotting on and off than to have a normal period.
48	650	I never had spotting or anything negative happen.
48	651	I have had a little spotting over the course of the past few months, nothing I can complain about.
48	652	I had a lot of spotting at first but now I don't really have a period at all.
48	653	I haven't had a period since then, but I have had spotting almost every day, which is extremely irritating.
48	654	I knew my periods would be unpredictable with spotting.
48	655	On Implanon within a year I started paying attention to my periods and it varied from spotting a few days to a period every other week.
48	656	And to top the hated spotting the hormones made me have a bad smell the first day of my period/spotting.
48	657	I have a friend who is a nurse and made a suggestion that sounded bankers to me but I have completely stopped spotting after a week!
48	658	I do have random periods and have gone a few months with no period and then have had 4 periods in the last two months, and every once in a while I have spotting, so the bleeding is pretty random.
48	659	I had lots of spotting but eventually stopped and still have no side effects.
48	660	However, I don't have any spotting in between periods; my period is just extra long.
48	661	But it was more like a normal period with 2 weeks of spotting.
48	662	I've experienced some minor spotting, but it's nothing to cry over.
48	663	I get a lot of breakthrough bleeding and not just spotting.
48	664	The first month was the worst part I had spotting and a swollen arm but that was nothing I could not handle.
48	665	After about 2 weeks of having it in I started to experience spotting but it lasted for around 7 weeks continuously and went and saw my doctor and now I am on the pill as well as to try to regulate my period.
48	666	I have a few friends that are using Implanon and they have all had light spotting for about a week or two, and then it stopped completely!
48	667	From research it seems like the majority of people don't have spotting the whole time, but I absolutely love this thing already.
48	668	Had very light spotting every two weeks and came like clockwork.
48	669	No negative changes, very light spotting for a couple of days a month.
48	670	The only thing is last week I started to spot and am still spotting.
48	671	I have experienced a lot of spotting in the beginning and now I seem to have a period regularly.
48	672	So far I feel fine, no feeling sick like I would have done changing pill, no bloated tummy, no spotting.
48	673	I have only had one instance of light spotting which was about two months ago.
48	674	I've had Implanon since November 2009 and at first I had irregular spotting for up to 3 weeks at a time but it gradually lessened.
48	675	I forgot I had it over summer, only had light spotting for a few days after traveling in September.
48	676	I got the Implanon on September 3 2010 and so far I have had mood swings like crazy and had my period for 1 1/2 weeks (normal for me is 3 days) and spotting for another week.
48	677	The first year and a half I had no period - minimal spotting.
48	678	And it isn't just spotting, it's a full period with PMS lasting around 5 days.
48	679	The first was brilliant had hardly any periods, just a tiny bit of spotting.
48	680	After about 6 months I've started having light periods or spotting which hasn't ceased in the last 2 months.
48	681	I had light spotting the second week.
48	682	I have now been spotting for 6 weeks with weeks of significant bleeding.
48	683	No problems in the beginning; still had my period only lighter, with some spotting.
48	684	Now I've been spotting for the past 3 weeks and all I want to do it eat.
48	685	I haven't got my period at all just some spotting for like a day but that is it.
48	686	Just spotting like once or twice.
48	687	My periods went to very light to spotting immediately.
48	688	Now, the problem is the spotting timing has changed/now more of discharging brownish color and had more concerns.
48	689	I had one week of very very light spotting, and a few headaches.
48	690	Since it was inserted, I’ve experienced slight spotting, but have never had to use anything more than a panty liner.
48	691	I was spotting when I had it put in and it actually stopped a day after having it inserted.
48	692	My period comes on for about 6-7 days, stops for about 1 or 2 and then starts spotting again.
48	693	I've had no weight gain, crazy mood swings or changes to my sex drive, so the spotting is my only complaint.
48	694	Now, I have been spotting for the past 3 weeks and am experiencing EXTREME mood swings.
48	695	Besides that I bleed for almost two weeks with blood lots and all but now I bleed regular with occasional spotting but my mood swings are ridiculous.
48	696	Sometimes they were short and I called it spotting, but then I would spot for about 1-2 weeks.
48	697	I have had two periods since July (it is November), and they were both short and more of a heavy spotting.
48	698	The only side effect is the implant gets sore around the time of the month, so I know when the spotting is coming.
48	699	I had it for 6 months, and only a few days of that I wasn't bleeding or at least spotting.
48	700	At first I had all the normal side effects - spotting for a few days and such.
48	701	My period did not start instead I had all the PMS symptoms and a little bit of spotting.
48	702	I love it because I have not gained weight, I have light spotting to no periods and it's stuck in my arm so I don't have to remember my birth control daily.
48	703	No it wasn't spotting, it was still bright red blood.
48	704	But 6 weeks later, I am still spotting!
48	705	I have experienced no weight gain and after one month of spotting I have not had a period at all since then.
48	706	I was on it for nearly ten years with only minimal spotting.
48	707	When I did spot I took estrogen supplements and stopped spotting in a couple days.
48	708	About 5 weeks later I started spotting and it continued for about 3 weeks with little breaks in between.
48	709	It stopped for about 5 more weeks and now we're on with the spotting again.
48	710	One day I started spotting and haven't stopped since.
48	711	I did have random light spotting every three or four months (sometimes even longer) that would last from 3 days to 7 days.
48	712	Of course there's spotting.
48	713	I had my normal period until day 6 and stopped bleeding for 7 days when I started spotting for 9 days.
48	714	I then stopped bleeding for 7 more days and then started spotting again for 5 days.
48	715	I stopped bleeding for 9 days and have had a period now for 9 days (more than just spotting).
48	716	About 2 weeks after I got the implant I had a period for about 4 days and then I was spotting for a week after that and then it stopped and so far I haven't had anything.
48	717	I touch and feel it on a daily and it is still in the spot the doctor put it in.
48	718	I just spot, but then again it's not 100% that you're not gonna get it or it's gonna be light.
48	719	But my periods stayed like that for a while , then they started lasting 3 weeks , and then I'd spot for the last week.
48	720	For the first 2 - 3 months, I didn't get a period, but I did spot.
48	721	I've gained 5 stone in weight, I have had huge spots come up all over my body but mainly on my face and neck, I've used every spot treatment out there including medications from my doctor, I've had tender breasts most of the time and have no energy at all, I've spent the last 3 years on diets and exercising and even using weight loss pills and the weight will not shift.
48	722	They're spot on with weight gain, personality changes, and irregular period.
48	723	I would spot then stop the next day or get a heavy flow then the next week spot again.
48	724	The first month I had it I didn't have a period, after that I had 2 months of heavy periods lasting about 2 weeks, then I would lightly spot almost every single day without any real periods in between.
48	725	But the next month, there was a very mild spot one time during the day and that was it!
48	726	My breasts get tender sometimes, and I spot occassionally, but its nothing more than a bit of 'pink' on the paper when I go to the toilet.
48	727	I get really off-time periods and spot for weeks sometimes.
48	728	Then after that I never got another period until now, it's getting near the end of the 3rd year and I'm starting to spot lightly.
48	729	I spot bleed every other day.
48	730	I had Implanon put into my arm whilst I was still breastfeeding which was about November last year ( 2014) I noticed no bleeding at all and five months later still not one spot of blood.
48	731	I got the Implanon June 2014, It was fine for the first week then I started to spot, have headaches/migraines as well as being very moody/emotional.
48	732	I do however spot in between periods and as of recently I've been bleeding excessively to the point where I have to change my pad almost every 2 hours and it's completely full or has overflown.
48	733	The second insert caused me to spot for a few days, and after that I've had light, sporadic periods.
48	734	I only spot for about a day or two each month and thats it.
48	735	I would spot here and there in the beginning but it went away and I do not spot anymore.
48	736	Got it taken out today and had the Nexplanon put in the same spot.
48	737	Then, later I would spot here and there.
48	738	If I recall correctly you do spot the first year or the first two years.
48	739	For the first 2 months I did spot every day but that has gone away now.
48	740	Now this year is the same, I would spot every now and then but never nothing serious.
48	741	I received quite the bruise and sore spot but nothing that was unbearable, I am now left with a little scar.
48	742	Arm was itchy for a while in the spot it was inserted and you can tell something is there but thats all.
48	743	You may spot once in a while but its really light.
48	744	2 weeks later after my period is non stop I spot everyday and on days will have heavy bleeding.
48	745	I spot bleed for a couple of days every other month or so, other than that no side effects at all.
48	746	I've also noticed that I spot or fully start my period after sex sometimes.
48	747	I spot every once in a while but its not bad with a panty liner.
48	748	However, whenever I have intercourse, I will spot bleed.
48	749	I spot for about 2 weeks, have 1 week of a normal period, and then am off for 3-4 weeks.
48	750	The first three weeks were great, no side effects but now it is time for my regular period and all I have done was spot for 8 days.
48	751	It's like my period wants to start but all I do is spot.
48	752	I like Implanon because it only made me spot a couple of times and now my period hasn't come again and I've had it in since the beginning of August 2011.
48	753	I had my period for 2 weeks every month and then I would spot for 2 weeks and then have maybe a week without bleeding and then it would start again.
48	754	I spot from time to time but very little and not even every month that I even spot.
48	755	There was little to no pain, and the insertion spot healed very well.
48	756	I was very irregular before Implanon, and still experience my periods irregularly, sometimes they are heavy, other times I just spot.
48	757	I have a little red spot where it was put in but nothing extreme.
48	758	I do have spot bleeding every few weeks but no need for tampons anymore, just the miniature liners which I keep in my purse.
48	759	I had no side effects other than bam like 6 months into it I noticed a bald spot in my head it started to get bigger an more started to appear.
48	760	The spot on my arm was sore for about a week after and I have a very small (nick) of a scar.
48	761	I nursed my baby for a year and at 10 months I started to spot...nothing too bad, but then it just got worse.
48	762	I would rather gain a bit of spot bleeding than have the head pain.
48	763	I did spot for a few days about a month into use and even then, it was very light.
48	764	The spot was tender for a few days and I did have an ugly bruise and now a tiny scar, but nothing that is too terrible.
48	765	I started to spot so my GYN had me on the Vivelle Dot for 3 months.
48	766	I spot here and there I haven't had a real period.
48	767	Some things that i dont really like is i spot here and there ( not to often though ) and the first few months i had it in my arm irritated me really badly.
48	768	I've had no weight gain that wasn't my own fault, im not irritable, I spot from time to time but nothing major.
48	769	It was a little sore after the implant, but I don't bleed, (I never did) I just spot for about a day a month, if that.
48	770	Every time I get rid the infection, I spot and the pH change brings it back!
48	771	I will spot for four days then period for 20 days.
48	772	I spotted constantly for almost the entire 3 yrs.
48	773	First period started 1 week after inserted lasted two and half weeks, and since then I have spotted / light bleeding everyday.
48	774	I spotted once the first week and that was it.
48	775	I spotted about 2 x a week, but after that it went away.
48	776	I spotted one time in 2016 and it was about a month after I got the implant, I think it was just because my body was just trying to get used to the horomones.
48	777	I haven't spotted since then.
48	778	It hurt a little for about 1 1/2 weeks and for the first month bleed and spotted every day but since then have not had any periods at all have been sexually active and not gotten pregnant.
48	779	I had my period in August, and spotted a little in September but I have not had my period since which the doctor said was normal.
48	780	Besides that it completely stopped my period that day and I havent spotted or bled at all.
48	781	I spotted for about a week and then all hell broke loose (literally) I've been bleeding heavily for 2 months now.
48	782	I spotted for about 2 weeks when I first had it inserted and then I didn't have a period for about a year and returned to normal.
48	783	I haven't spotted, but I'm not complaining.
48	784	The first two months were tricky, my period lasted for about 3 weeks then just spotted and then stopped completely.
48	785	I basically had my period for 3-4 weeks, then spotted for 2, and *if* I was lucky, had 2 weeks period free.
48	786	I spotted for a few days then had then had a period once every 3 months.
48	787	When I first got the implant in I had spotted bleeding for like 2 weeks straight, and then nothing.
48	788	I spotted really lightly for 6 months and then I got a terrible period for 7 days.
48	789	Had a regular period the first week, then spotted on and off for about 2 months.
48	790	The first year I spotted once every few months.
48	791	I spotted for a few days right after I had it inserted but then I didn't get my period for well over a year!
48	792	Have not had any periods in 5 years, (spotted a bit the first month only) and plan to continue to use the Implanon until I'm completely menopausal (still perimenopausal).
48	793	I spotted for about 6 months the first year and have not had a period since.
48	794	I haven't bled or spotted but it isn't the time of the month yet.
48	795	I spotted for a little while or randomly here or there, but nothing heavy or bothersome.
48	796	I had my Implanon inserted a little over a month ago and I spotted 20 days out of the 1st month.
48	797	I have had the Implanon for about 8 months and I bled for 2 months straight then spotted for 2 more months.
48	798	I started what I thought was my period that lasted for 2 weeks, spotted again, and then the cycle started again.
48	799	Only spotted for 3 days and nothing since.
48	800	When I got my first cycle after having it inserted, it lasted like two days and I spotted for about a week and a half following that.
48	801	In-between my periods, I spotted a lot and even had a 17 day period several weeks after having it inserted.
48	802	I may have spotted for 2 days after about 15 days of having it.
48	803	I spotted for 6 months straight after I had it put in and then would randomly get my period.
48	804	However, I have "spotted" for 68 of the 90 days!
48	805	I have no periods - I spotted the day I got it and at 1st I was moody but it's great now.
48	806	I can't stand it and on top of that the headache are almost unbearable.
48	807	I am in pain constantly ie back tummy headache I'm exhausted everyday.
48	808	For 2 months no period at all I started to get paranoid thinking I might be pregnant or the other medication I am on made it ineffective, but when I woke up this morning at first felt the same symptoms with tge nausea and lightheaded, my stomach feels hard to touch then suddenly my monthly came back after 2 months now im not sure if this is because of the implant or if theres something going on with my body all i know is that thus implant is causing me a lot of headache as i never know when my monthly will show
48	809	I didn't had weight gain, emotional lability, headache, period abdominal pain or crazy hormones symptoms, nothing!, is like I'm not using anything.
48	810	A few days later I had to get a blood patch, because I got a spinal headache.
48	811	I've had this since 2002 and had an okay experience but recently, I got diagnosed high blood preasure 214/115 (normal 120/70) when I was in with a nasty headache.
48	812	Thinking back I've had headache on and off for about 3 years and now I'm connecting the two, so please beware and check with you doctor!
48	813	I had a bruise in the area and I also experienced slight nausea and dizziness after insertion which ended in a headache but the next day I was fine.
48	814	I believe that the Depo is now finally out of my system, so now I have periods but they are on the lighter side (lasting about 4-5 days) and I may get a small headache on the first day of the period.
48	815	I've been getting some of the not so good side effects (mood swings, depression, headache, some weight gain).
48	816	I haven't had a headache.
48	817	Sometimes light headache, but goes away in few minutes.
48	818	But the only other side effect I've gotten from this is the occasional KILLER headache, but an 800mg Motrin takes that away.
48	819	I've always got a headache.
48	820	I have a headache every other day.
48	821	I cannot take the bleeding, headache and mood swings.
48	822	I got it replaced ( which it was stuck so I now have permanent nerve damage ) and with the new one I have nausea , dizziness, angry, headaches, pelvic pain and hot flashes.
48	823	My second implant well  day to day headaches, feeling low and put on 2 stone in 9 months.
48	824	I gained weight a lot from 110 to 201 if I tried a strict strict diet I would have severe headaches where 3 pills wouldn't work at all sometimes I felt numbness in my arms and legs they said it was normal.
48	825	I have had the Implanon now for 3 months and can safely say it's great, no periods and no more migraines as the microginon pill was giving me hellish headaches!...
48	826	This implant is causing my body so many problems I have headaches all the time , My breast hurt , My back hurts , And it's so difficult trying to lose weight on this it makes me eat unusual I eat all day ..
48	827	But I'm always cold and eat ice a lot, which are signs for anemia and I'm experiencing headaches more regularly than I use to.
48	828	I have hated every second of it more than any other form of contraception (which includes a bad experience with a coil) I have gained weight, I am hormonal and emotional most of the time and I have severe headaches.
48	829	Significant weight gain, headaches, nausea, fatigue/insomnia, no periods for months and then weeks of bleeding.
48	830	I don't have a history of migraines or headaches and now every single day my head is killing me without relief from over the counter meds.
48	831	I do get headaches occasionally, however they are easy to fix with painkillers.
48	832	The headaches are constant!
48	833	I have  headaches,  no weight gain.
48	834	I had heavy bleeding for 2 weeks after, terrible headaches and mood swings and i noticed some weight was packing in.
48	835	It's also given me terrible mood swings and headaches.
48	836	I have lost weight but have been bloated, with constant headaches.
48	837	I've had headaches, body aches and serious weight gain.
48	838	(I always used to be skinny) I get headaches and body pains almost everyday.
48	839	I also had really bad headaches at least twice a month and the mood swings were horrible I just wasn't myself.
48	840	I got really bad headaches as well.
48	841	And I've been getting headaches nonstop ever since I got it in.
48	842	Not just regular headaches but migraine like ones.
48	843	But I have found that I am experiencing many symptoms in 6 months of having it: depression, weight gain (15lbs), no period, PMS all the time, headaches and lowered sex drive.
48	844	No headaches and down 6lbs in a little over a month!
48	845	Severe headaches 21 pound gain in weight and nothing will shift it healthy eating and gym but no loose.
48	846	Now I've experienced every thing from headaches to dizziness to weight gain.
48	847	I had a birth control inplanted in my arm 3 weeks ago and I am having it taken out, I have experienced bad headaches, I break out and have bad mood swings usually I am a sweet person but now I am the opposite I am mean and I don't like that at all.
48	848	I had no side effects such as headaches or irregular periods.
48	849	I had had no bleeding til recently and now it's 2 -3 times a month causing me to feel sick with bad headaches.
48	850	I started getting headaches and very emotional.
48	851	I love it I haven't had any weight gain and the only problem was my period lasted a month but other then that I have very few headaches and haven't gotten pregnant
48	852	The first time i got it i had mood swings, headaches and the last three months before it needed to get removed i had the heaviest period i have ever had.
48	853	No weight gain, mood swings, or headaches.
48	854	I have had it for almost 5 months now and at  first I did get migranes and gained about 20 lbs but after about 2 months the headaches went away and I am just now getting my period for the first time since starting this birth control.
48	855	Heavy bleeding, horrible headaches, and terrible uncontrollable mood swings.
48	856	After second child got it again only this time I have terrible migraine headaches, mood swings and weight gain, I have tried losing weight and  eating healthy and I do lose the weight but it has to be a strict diet and exercise routine or else my weight will just come right back I also get my period about 2-3 time a month!
48	857	I also started getting more headaches and nausea always!
48	858	No weight gain, no nausea, no headaches and no other side effects.
48	859	I never had depression or weight loss or gained any but I do get less headaches then what I did before.
48	860	It works, didn't get pregnant for the full 3 years, however, I had some mood swings from hell, headaches, anxiety, depression, dryness, and little to no sex drive.
48	861	I went through depression, anxiety and had serious headaches.
48	862	The headaches are bad too, lasting days at a time (I've learned to ignore them) but I know this is because my blood pressure is NEVER under 160.
48	863	Within one month of getting Implanon I started getting serious headaches, and in February I began passing out randomly, I had low blood pressure, low heart rate, and was diagnosed with pseudo tumor cerebri.
48	864	I have had back pains, headaches, my cycle is unpredictable I bleed from 5-14 days and have gained a tremendous amount of weight.
48	865	I get bad headaches and stomache aches.
48	866	I have headaches on it, mood swings, low energy but other than that it's great.
48	867	I have crazy mood swings, I get extremely depressed, crave junk food, sex drive is way down, I get horrible headaches, and abdominal pain.
48	868	I've also had more headaches since the implant, (3-4 a week) but I haven't had a period or any random bleeding these past 3 years.
48	869	no weight gain, no headaches, no side effects  I LOVE LOVE IT!
48	870	I didn't mind it, but I was getting a lot of headaches.
48	871	I also get frequent headaches.
48	872	Yes it gives me headaches occasionally but another child would do the same.
48	873	I get killer headaches.
48	874	LOTS of headaches.
48	875	I have actually lost weight, I am a bit more emotional, but I've always cried about everything, I haven't had an increase in headaches or anything, and my sex drive is as good as it's always been.
48	876	I have bad headaches, moody, no energy.
48	877	Over the last couple months, I have been getting a lot of headaches, which I have very rarely ever had and I just wake up angry some mornings or I just don't feel anything.
48	878	No side effects, no weight gain, no headaches and no bleeding of any kind.
48	879	I had a couple of headaches for the first day or so.
48	880	I have headaches all of the time, I am very snappy and cranky all of the time and have to constantly remind people that I'm usually not like this.
48	881	I have horrible rage and depression, headaches, bad skin and weight gain.
48	882	I never once got a period while on it, no weird food cravings or headaches and I've actually lost 50 pounds while on it!
48	883	Despite this minor inconvenience and a few slight headaches, I really don't have any major complaints.
48	884	I have headaches at least two times a week so I have decided to have it taken out and even though medicaid paid to have it put in they WILL NOT pay to have it removed so it will cost me 300 dollars to have it taken out.
48	885	So far so good, the only side effects I have had are headaches and cravings.
48	886	I have not gotten any headaches from Implanon as compared to the pill.
48	887	But for the last month and a half I have been having horrible headaches, no sex drive, mood swings but worst of all I have been having random pains all over my body.
48	888	I ended up gaining weight which is something I can deal with but I started to get really bad headaches and it started affecting my vision and my daily activities.
48	889	Other than the periods I have been having severe headaches.
48	890	I had frequent headaches, and no appetite.
48	891	I have terrible headaches EVERYDAY, severe mood swings, no patience, no sex drive.
48	892	I've gained a lot of weight and I have been getting headaches and been moody.
48	893	I've also had hair loss and headaches.
48	894	I used to suffer from frequent migraine headaches associated with a spike in monthly estrogen levels, Implanon helped me to have fewer headaches.
48	895	My sex drive has also gone way down most likely because I have chronic headaches all the time.
48	896	Other than that don't notice any weight gain, I have been getting headaches but I also have a cold so I'm not sure if that's the birth control yet.
48	897	I have actually had an increase in my sex drive, and my migraine headaches (which I was getting at least once a week) have now greatly reduced.
48	898	I have no pains or bleeding or headaches.
48	899	Yes, it is convenient that I do not have to take a pill or receive a shot; however it is not worth the constant bleeding, and pains, and headaches.
48	900	I have trashed my stomach lining because I was taking so much ibuprofen to control my headaches.
48	901	At present I have very mild headaches on and off, and lower back pain, but not enough to need to take anything to ease it.
48	902	I get headaches, and back aches around time for my monthly cycle.
48	903	I get headaches all the time which I never got before.
48	904	The only other thing I have noticed is I get headaches from time to time, which I never did before.
48	905	Then as I started to get headaches and mood swings, I worried more!
48	906	I have had no problems, not one.... no weight gain, no headaches, no pregnancy and most of all since then I have had 3-4 day periods!
48	907	I am always keeping headaches and mood swings.
48	908	I have had a few headaches but no weight gain or NO PERIODS!
48	909	Tylenol fixed the headaches.
48	910	There have been a few negative side effects (heart burn, some headaches, and slight pain at the insertion sight), but the ease of not having to take a pill everyday far outweighs those slight annoyances.
48	911	I also noticed that I would get headaches if I didn't eat a good breakfast.
48	912	The headaches stopped when the long bleeding stopped.
48	913	I have also noticed headaches very often, lack of sex drive and lower back pain.
48	914	I haven't had ANY bleeding, dischagres, weight gain, lost of sex drive, headaches, etc.
48	915	Some headaches, a little lower sex drive, and NO MORE BABIES!
48	916	I also have had bad headaches.
48	917	Body aches and migraines, headaches everyday.
48	918	I've had Implanon for about 9 months and at first I thought it was the greatest thing in the world but about 4 months I started bleeding twice a month for about 3-4 days, extreme fatigue, terrible headaches, moody, weight gain about 15 lbs(same eating habits as before).
48	919	Then I started getting headaches, light headed or dizzy, panic attacks and slight depression.
48	920	Two weeks before the headaches got worse as did the panic attacks.
48	921	No headaches and weight gain yet.
48	922	I'm not having the problem with weight gain, or hair loss, but I do get headaches and my breast are sore sometimes.
48	923	I have also had headaches, which I NEVER suffer from usually but, unlike many others, I have not gained weight.
48	924	As soon as I put it in I had a migraine lasted 3 days then it subsided.
48	925	I cannot use combined pill due to familt history of cardiac problems and migraine myself.
48	926	My doctor sent me to get an MRI, but nothing was wrong, and they diagnosed "complex" migraine.
48	927	It's one thing to get a migraine once a month but now it's like every other week.
48	928	After going to the ER with a migraine, I stopped the estrogen patch.
48	929	I have had a migraine for the past 4 days that not even migraine medicine and sleep can't take away.
48	930	I had to take tonnes of time off work due to the above along with stomach pains, migraines, sleep problems and the list goes on.
48	931	I would take a little blood compared to migraines, risk of blood clots, hormonal imbalances, or an unplanned pregnancy, which are more common with other BC options.
48	932	Then the migraines started.
48	933	And the migraines were the worst.
48	934	I do get migraines and it works awesome!
48	935	The pill was giving me serious migraines so that's why I made the switch.
48	936	First 3 months were okay, the following 3 months started experiencing very extreme migraines (which I already had an issue with prior to insertion) mood swings very drastic mood swings, no energy to much, always tired and no desire to do anything.
48	937	I had my period twice in one month the first time I got Implanon, but then completely stopped having my period, I also noticed my menstrual migraines no longer came around.
48	938	I used to have migraines but now I get one at least every other day, also I'm very emotional.
48	939	I was switched to this about 6 months ago by my Gyno because Ortho has estrogen and that wasn't good with my migraines and the side effects I have with those.
48	940	At first I was super excited because it was a no fuss birth control that would cause me migraines.
48	941	I have not had my period since I've had it but instead I've had bloating, mood swings, lowered sex drive oh and my migraines have gotten worse.
48	942	I have a history of migraines, usually getting them every couple of months, but during the last six months of having Implanon, I was getting them twice a week, with bizarre symptoms.
48	943	My migraines would make me feel like my face and entire left side of my body was numb.
48	944	Had Implanon removed 2 months later, and the weird migraines stopped.
48	945	I have more migraines which I never experienced before Implanon.
48	946	I've had no weight gain due to it but I've had some back aches, some migraines, and 2 really bad mood swings.
48	947	I've always had migraines so its hard to say which ones are caused by the Implanon, but I do see an increase in them and consistency (although they don't always last too long and not always as intense).
48	948	I have tried over 15 types of contraceptive combined pills, a few mini pills and they all gave me bad migraines.
48	949	My doctor has recommended Nexplanon implant as it is not known yet to give migraines.
48	950	I get migraines with my periods.
48	951	The first time was much like this time round no period, weight gain from 75kg to 120 kg, mood swings, migraines.
48	952	I've also had lots of migraines and had pain in both of my breasts.
48	953	I have no sex drive what so ever and have experienced severe mood swings, migraines and weight gain.
48	954	Since I had the birth control inserted, I have gained about 10 pounds and I was prescribed daily medication for my migraines.
48	955	I was very bad at taking the pills regularly, and the shot gave me migraines like no others I've ever experienced.
48	956	Other than that I would recommend it to other people who like me get migraines from the extra estrogen and are bad at taking pills every day.
48	957	I have had migraines, leg and arm pains, severe mood swings, depression, my periods are so out of control, I wear a pad every day just in case.
48	958	It does not effect my sex drive and I haven't had a period in 5 years except when the three year mark is up and it needs to be replaced.
48	959	I also have no sex drive at all.
48	960	My sex drive was fine.
48	961	My experience was depression, weight gain, hair lost, anxiety, bloating, no sex drive and would get my period every 2 months and when it did it lasted up to 2 weeks.
48	962	My sex drive is great.
48	963	Sex drive has slowed down and mood swings here and there.
48	964	My boyfriend and I used to have sex all the time... Because I didn't want to get knocked up, I got on this thing and well it worked, mainly because you lose your sex drive, gain absolutely tons of weight and can't stand the little things you used to ignore.
48	965	We have been married nearly 20 years but now it looks like it is all over, mood swings and no sex drive.
48	966	No sex drive.
48	967	However throughout the 6 months on it my mental health declined as well as my sex drive and I started to get very anxious and thinking everyone was out to get me.
48	968	I had it out two days ago and I can already feel that I'm feeling better, I can't tell if this is in my mind or the hormone starting to leave but my sex drive has definitely started to improve.
48	969	For the past few months My sex drive is 0.
48	970	The second thing I don't like about it is I have no sex drive what so ever.
48	971	I still haven't gained any weight but my sex drive has been down this last month (it could be from the contestant bleeding) doesn't make me feel sexy and I had a really high sex drive before I feel like it's ruining my sex life with my bf
48	972	My sex drive vanished once I got on it.
48	973	It was great until I had 12 weeks of nonstop heavy bleeding and then went 4-5 weeks of no period which was awesome but now my period has come  back with vengeance I don't think I've gained weight just really bloated my sex drive is gone and I'm more agitated at things easily but I've heard implanon (when you take it out) can cause you not to be able to have a baby ever again.... not sure if this is true but a friend of mine took hers out got pregnant twice and lost both babies at 23 weeks this scares me because I plan on exspanding my family I only have one child can anyone make me feel better on this?
48	974	My sex drive has not changed it seems like it even got better..
48	975	My sex drive is fine but as a single person it makes it rather difficult to meet people when you're literally bleeding all the time!
48	976	5 years later and I didnt get pregnant so thats an A+ but the largest side effect has been my plummeted sex drive.
48	977	The one reason why I am considering getting it removed sooner is because I've lost interest in alot of things,but my SEX DRIVE is completely gone.
48	978	2 months after I had my baby I decided to get the inplonon worst mistake EVERR I had no sex drive at all and my mood swings were so bad that my husband and I almost broke up over me being in such a bad mood all the time I also got  very depressed I knew it wasn't the baby blues because I was soo happy with my new daughter.
48	979	My sex drive is so bad.
48	980	The only things I would say is a bad side effect for me is that I have no sex drive at all, and I also have a lot of dryness when I do try to have sex.
48	981	I am 30 years old and used to have a high sex drive and now my sex drive is non existent.
48	982	But i did have a lack of sex drive, since having it removed it took 6 weeks to get my period and my sex drive has increased drastically.
48	983	The only side effects I experienced were a complete lack of period (which I think is great) but a reduced sex drive as well.
48	984	Zero sex drive and insane mood swings since having it in as well.
48	985	My sex drive isn't as high as it was without any birth control, but it's definitely higher than it was on the nuvaring.
48	986	Also no sex drive, no energy and weight gain.
48	987	My sex drive is dead and to top it all off, I started lightly bleeding in June and it never stopped.
48	988	side effects were sweating problems and loss of sex drive.
48	989	Seemed to work fine for first 3 years, however 2nd time round mood swings are horrendous, weight gain of approx 2 stone no matter how much exercise/diets i never shed a pound, total loss of sex drive, and heavy irregular bleeding - getting it removed now.
48	990	My sex drive is healthy as well.
48	991	I normally have a very high sex drive and that hasn't changed at all.
48	992	So I got the implanon inserted 2 years ago in the last 2 years I have gained about 20 kgs , lost my sex drive , my emotions have been up and down like a yoyo just cry then want to punch something then have no idea what I was even sad/angry about .
48	993	I had this removed yesterday morning and within 24 hours my sex drive kicked back in again.
48	994	The first 3 years were wonderful, I had no periods, I did have low sex drive and some mood swings but nothing like now.
48	995	I've been bleeding constantly for 4 months with a lowered sex drive (dramatically!)
48	996	My experience has been very positive, I have had complete loss of period since getting the implant and no noticeable side effects apart from a lower sex drive which I have only discovered since getting it removed.
48	997	Other things I have noticed are I get pain in my breasts occasionally, poor sex drive, bad mood swings and worsened eczema.
48	998	This partnered with the hormonal changes completely destroyed my sex drive.
48	999	I felt constantly depressed and my sex drive basically disappeared.
48	1000	My sex drive is gone I'm always sick and get the worse mood swings.
48	1001	Well my sex drive is gone!
48	1002	Okay for me the implant didn't work out so well, bleeding, big one was depression, loss of sex drive, and I just wasn't my self.
48	1003	Although I love not having periods, the weight I gained and my lack of sex drive is what made me remove it.
48	1004	My sex drive is normal and it does what it's meant to do not get me pregnant.
48	1005	Unfortunately though, two weeks later and my sex drive was gone, I was having anger outbursts daily and I fell in a deep depression.
48	1006	Sex drive is rockin, I can smile, my energy is back and I've lost 6lbs!
48	1007	I also lost some of my sex drive and I hope working out helps bring it back.
48	1008	My boyfriend loves it but dislikes the lack of sex drive.
48	1009	I will say I do have a low sex drive but unfortunately I think that's just me!!
48	1010	My sex drive completely disappeared, and I had frequent urine and vaginal infections.
48	1011	I was in denial that the zero sex drive, long lasting periods, mood swings, depression and 45 pound weigh gain was because of that.
48	1012	Despite the decent prevention, it has hindered my sex drive greatly.
48	1013	I have an extremely high sex drive, lost/gained no weight at all, and haven't noticed any changes in my hair growth/loss.
48	1014	I'm always moody, tired and have no sex drive.
48	1015	not only that but there are times where I have 0 sex drive and I do not get wet enough I am considering getting it removed soon.
48	1016	I was lost, depressed, no sex drive at all, I would pick fights, was even suicidal.
48	1017	My mood has elevated, sex drive not so much an my hair is still pretty thin.
48	1018	I gained about 10 pounds in those months, low sex drive, awful mood swings, and major depression.
48	1019	I have a sex drive but some times I get a really sharp pain in my lower stomach that makes not want to have sex because the pain it causes is not worth it.
48	1020	I have not experience any mood swings, nor low sex drive.
48	1021	I was moody and had zero sex drive.
48	1022	I used to love sex and this has killed my sex drive completely like I never feel like having sex ever.
48	1023	I also have no sex drive anymore, I have no energy, and I have been very depressed which has never happened to me before.
48	1024	I never have had much of a sex drive to begin with so I don't know how much of an effect the implanon had on that side of things.
48	1025	Lastly, my sex drive completely went away so it almost felt pointless to stay on this.
48	1026	For the first 3 months right after I got Nexplanon I was extremely moody and my sex drive went kaput.
48	1027	I gained over 30 pounds in 5 months, have NO sex drive, extreme abdominal pains, periods for months (MONTHS) straight, very moody, and lethargic all the time.
48	1028	), sex drive has disappeared.
48	1029	My sex drive isn't really that high either which I don't mind but not my boyfriend.
48	1030	Got it 3 years ago and have had it re inserted in the last 6 months ..found it great for the first 3 years rarely had periods but when I did at random times..did not affect my sex drive but my skin has suffered terribly with break outs ..since I reinserted it its is a completely different story very heavy period I'm a complete emotional basket case extreme mood swings not feeling myself ..seriously considering a new form of contraception...
48	1031	I also have ZERO sex drive, bad mood swings, and periods of extreme lethargy.
48	1032	Down side is my sex drive is out of the window, I am not as 'wet' as I used to be, making sex uncomfortable.
48	1033	And just recently my sex drive has almost nearly disappeared.
48	1034	Also my sex drive has gone down tremendously.
48	1035	Negatives; I have NO sex drive, have gained 35 pounds (rapidly) since the implant, I have slight mood swings and have been short tempered since starting this birth control method.
48	1036	My periods are completely random and have zero sex drive.
48	1037	I have gain 5 pounds (I'm less active) and have a lower sex drive but its not that bad.
48	1038	The only major downfall is the lack of sex drive.
48	1039	No sex drive whatsoever, that's the downside.
48	1040	I am 22 and I been on since I was 21, I havent had a period since I have been on, which is fine but my sex drive is out the window.
48	1041	It also killed my sex drive and made me tired all the time.
48	1042	Haven't got pregnant or lost sex drive.
48	1043	or that my husband & I are rarely having sex due to constant bleeding & my loss of sex drive?
48	1044	I have crazy mood swings when I think of sex I just want to throw up  (hence sex drive gone).
48	1045	But all that I could handle well the only thing that had me concerned was my sex drive and weight gain.
48	1046	After the first year my sex drive has slowly come back and I'm also slowly losing weight but I have to really work on it.
48	1047	I'm now two years and 6 months into it and I have a fully wonderful sex drive.
48	1048	However I have a non existent sex drive and it's really rocking my marriage.
48	1049	I have a completely normal sex drive, normal mood swings, and I haven't had a period since it was put in!
48	1050	I've experienced in this very short time, no sex drive whatsoever along with dryness of the vagina!
48	1051	No increase of appetite and no loss of sex drive.
48	1052	I did not experience any decline in sex drive, however my appetite went through the roof!
48	1053	Also, caused my sex drive to become pretty much non-existent.
48	1054	I started having no sex drive and had very dry vagina.
48	1055	My sex drive is the same.
48	1056	It didn't do anything to me sex drive.
48	1057	I have lost my sex drive, I've been bipolar this thing had made me crazy I cannot wait to get it removed and have my life back.
48	1058	I 100% lost my sex drive.
48	1059	I havent lost my sex drive but my husbands job is 1week on 1week off so I guess its hard to tell.
48	1060	I can say I haven't gotten pregnant not only bc I'm not sexual when bleeding which is ALL the time, but bc my sex drive is almost non existent.
48	1061	I don't know how it affects my sex drive.
48	1062	All in all this is the most emotionally stable I've felt out of all the birth control methods I've tried, and it hasn't had much effect on my sex drive,  but I'm not super active anyway so I don't see any difference as I'm sure I would if I were in a long term relationship.
48	1063	Same sex drive, no excessive hair or weight gain.
48	1064	I'm super moody and my sex drive has gone way down.
48	1065	My only negative to it is ABSOLUTELY NO SEX DRIVE and it's making my husband think I'm not attracted to him anymore and that it not the case at all so I'm going to have it taken out a little early and try something different.
48	1066	Overall, it serves it main purpose, but it does come with a lot of extra weight, mood swings, and lowered sex drive.
48	1067	Sex drive did not change at all and I had no problems losing weight on it.
48	1068	And for the most part my mood and sex drive had no change.
48	1069	My sex drive has slowed some but other then that its great.
48	1070	Sex drive is way down, bad mood swings, and constantly tired.
48	1071	My sex drive has gone down and my weight has gone up by about 50lbs and its hard to get off considering I don't have a period to get rid of the retained fluid but all in all I love that I haven't got pregnant.
48	1072	The worst part is my sex drive has gone down so much.
48	1073	I didn't get pregnant, though my sex drive was extremely low.
48	1074	I had break through bleeding almost the whole time, which didn't help the sex drive.
48	1075	I have not put on weight, lost my sex drive or experienced heavy periods.
48	1076	My other biggest complaint is that my sex drive is bad.
48	1077	But lately I've become extremely exhausted, and I have NO sex drive whatsoever.
48	1078	My sex drive was normal and it was a relief not to make constant trips to the doc for condoms anymore specially since I've been with the same partner for over 5 years.
48	1079	No mood swings, not worrying about a pill, my weight stayed the same, and my sex drive increased.
48	1080	After awhile I started to lose my sex drive.
48	1081	The next day it was a little tender but not bad, did have some itching but that is normal for anything healing, had small bruise few days, very light bleeding for about a week, still have no period, and increased sex drive.
48	1082	I have not experienced the decreased sex drive thing so my hubby is fortunate for that.
48	1083	Me and my boyfriend have been together since I've put it on and sex drive is still the same if not better.
48	1084	The only side effect I experienced was a complete loss of sex drive, but it didn't effect the quality of my sex life & I figured there are worse things.
48	1085	I completely lost my sex drive and I had random bleeding.
48	1086	The only downfall is that I have no sex drive at all.
48	1087	No mood swings or loss in sex drive.
48	1088	I never felt like hanging out with my friends, never felt like going to my classes, I gained about 20 lbs, I started getting bad breakouts on my face and back, I had no sex drive AT ALL and always felt tired.
48	1089	It has been almost two years and my breakouts cleared up a lot but I still haven't lost the weight and I still have zero sex drive.
48	1090	I did notice a small decrease in sex drive but that was it.
48	1091	I have gained at least 20 Lbs, feel tired all the time and have no sex drive.
48	1092	I have however experienced a huge decrease in my sex drive.
48	1093	I am now developing anemia, I have lost my sex drive completely which may soon cost me my partner and the bleeds are getting more erratic and with that the mood swings.
48	1094	I have no sex drive and have been bleeding for about 3 weeks!!
48	1095	I still have my sex drive, no weight gain from the birth control and I'm pretty sure any moodiness is just my age.
48	1096	I have however gained weight, had a lot of cravings but have not lost my sex drive or suffered from any severe side effects.
48	1097	Absolutely no sex drive, I'm 21.
48	1098	My sex drive did decrease, but it has gotten better after 1 1/2 years.
48	1099	I have a sex drive and no vaginal dryness which are two pesky side effects I encountered with the NuvaRing and the Pill.
48	1100	Other then that I have no mood swings, no fatigue, no weight gain, no hot flashes, and my sex drive is completely fine, in fact if not better!
48	1101	No change in sex drive or mood and no weight gain- yay.
48	1102	The only negatives I can think of are slightly decreased sex drive (which you can work through) and sometimes feeling a bit depressed (which usually lasts less than a day).
48	1103	A couple more months went by and I was depressed on top of my moodiness, and my sex drive had died completely.
48	1104	I have no sex drive whatsoever and have gained 30lbs.
48	1105	Which makes life miserable, also my sex drive is non-existent.
48	1106	I am depressed and my sex drive is gone.
48	1107	I have had the implanon you're over a year and I have gained 15 pounds and have a two week period every month, very low sex drive and mood swings.
48	1108	I really do love this birth control, no periods at all, but, my sex drive is gone and I have mood swings, but not really sure if its the birth control and that I can't live with, So I'm getting it taken out in 2 weeks.
48	1109	I have weeks of bleeding and no sex drive.
48	1110	I'm anemic and I have no sex drive or energy to do anything.
48	1111	I even got my sex drive back.
48	1112	I have no sex drive.
48	1113	I had the Implanon in 2010 6 weeks after I had my daughter, Since then I have not been able to lose much weight and have mood swings, along with no sex drive.
48	1114	I'm always mad, depressed and have no sex drive!
48	1115	I've had menstrual bleeding for 11-21 days (at the longest) a month, muscle aches, ABSOLUTELY no sex drive (which is a complete 180 to before the Implanon) and I've actually been caught yelling at my 1 year old.
48	1116	Although I have had light bleeding for about 2 months now but it doesn't affect my relationship or sex drive.
48	1117	I'm moody, mean, rude, have no energy I'm tired all the time and have no sex drive at all and I've gained about 20 lbs.
48	1118	I am due to have it removed in 6 months however, for the past year I have experienced decrease in sex drive, weight gain of 30lbs and also mood swings.
48	1119	Since I was put on Implanon I've had really bad anxiety and my sex drive has gone down.
48	1120	I haven't experienced any kind of changes in appetite or sex drive.
48	1121	I have a very low sex drive and I'm only 20.
48	1122	Everyone is different though, I know a girl who has the Implanon and she gets no periods and never puts on weight and gets no mood swings and has a good sex drive!
48	1123	I had no sex drive whatsoever.
48	1124	Acne, mood swings, weight gain, even lowered sex drive could all be things being blamed on Implanon when really Implanon is not the cause.
48	1125	I have noticed a decrease in sex drive, however not having a little one right now is definitely more important to me.
48	1126	My breasts got smaller, I have lost complete sex drive, my breasts aren't sensitive anymore at all like they used to be and I'm so emotional, even crying at times.
48	1127	My sex drive isn't as high as it used to be, which I guess isn't a bad thing for my age.
48	1128	I do get some mood swings and a loss of sex drive.
48	1129	I've also seen people complain about low sex drive, mine has been normal if not heightened.
48	1130	The worst side effect is my loss in sex drive.
48	1131	I also have VERY low sex drive.
48	1132	The cons: my sex drive has gone down to zero (which if you never want to have sex you're not going to get pregnant) my periods only come every couple of months (there was a span of time where I actually went seven months without a period).
48	1133	Yeah it was tough at first but it will pass..no weight gain, still have sex drive, no periods at all, and no sickness.
48	1134	My sex drive didn't go down but I feel as if I'm in a race with my body to see if I can have sex before I start bleeding again.
48	1135	I still have a fantastic sex drive, not too moody, and haven't gained weight yet.
48	1136	My sex drive decreased and after having my period for months I started to get depressed.
48	1137	My sex drive is normal.
48	1138	I get periods every month, no craziness, sex drive has increased.
48	1139	I didn't experience weight gain although I was very depressed and moody, no sex drive which contradicts the point of having birth control!
48	1140	i have lost all sex drive at the age of 22.
48	1141	No moodiness, weight gain, depression, or decreased sex drive.
48	1142	This was 2 months ago, and I still have not lost any weight, and my sex drive hasn't increased much.
48	1143	The 1st time I had it I bleed so heavy with only a weeks break and my moods were all over the place and no sex drive.
48	1144	Now that I've had it for more then 9 months I have my complete sex drive back, bleeding has come more regular but still kind of crazy, my skin has cleared up and I'm feeling less depressed.
48	1145	My sex drive is still the same (awesome).
48	1146	In the first month, my breasts jumped a cup size, my skin suffered marginally, sex drive was still strong and weight gain was not an issue.
48	1147	Positives: I've had a great sex drive, absolutely no period or bleeding and no pregnancy.
48	1148	But so far I have had non stop bleeding, no sex drive, horrible mood swings, crying uncontrollably, hot flashes, so tired all the time...I mean exhausted.
48	1149	I have NO SEX DRIVE and my relationship has plummeted into the ground because of it.
48	1150	A few months after getting it put it I experienced weight gain I'm still dealing with this unexplainable fatigue and I've acquired a thyroid issue as well as the non stop bleeding, almost no sex drive and I'm only 21.
48	1151	Some bleeding some mood swings but not much different than before but no change in sex drive still the same may be a little higher than it was but the bleeding is getting in the way of sex.
48	1152	Reasons being: since Implanon my sex drive is gone..and I'm only 24 years old!
48	1153	My sex drive has gone wild and now my boyfriend can't even keep up.
48	1154	Implanon is my miracle drug, my sex drive has INCREASED and I'm happy.
48	1155	I love it, no major mood changes, no weight gain and my sex drive has increased.
48	1156	But it hasn't killed my sex drive or caused me to gain any weight.
48	1157	I have no sex drive and I am always moody.
48	1158	It has now been in my arm for nine months and I am having to deal with the following: Acne, increased appetite, loss of sex drive and horrible mood swings and I generally feel very low in myself.
48	1159	I am angry, emotional, and have no sex drive at all!
48	1160	NO SEX drive at all.
48	1161	All of these things come and go accept the loss of sex drive.
48	1162	My relationship is on the rocks because I haven't had a sex drive since April and haven't had sex in months.
48	1163	I have had no sex drive for about a year now.
48	1164	Before insertion I had a sex drive, good skin, lost all my weight from my pregnancy and wasn't angry or impatient all the time.
48	1165	My marriage is probably suffering because I have no sex drive.
48	1166	Tired, sad, depressed, no sex drive, weight gain, anger, aggressiveness, sweet tooth, but the worst - THE HORRIBLE mood swings!
48	1167	I then went 3 months WITHOUT a period, with a high sex drive, and feeling really happy.
48	1168	Ever since I have got it my sex drive has gone up, which is great, on the other hand though I bleed like crazy!
48	1169	I also have mood swings, sex drive mostly off.
48	1170	I have had the Implanon for three months now, the first month nothing happened, the second month I had severe mood swings 'pretend periods' (acts like I'm about to get it but nothing) and no sex drive whatsoever.
48	1171	Sex drive off and on.
48	1172	My breasts stay so tender and I have zero sex drive.
48	1173	Sex drive - not there.
48	1174	The only negative side effect I've experienced is a lowered sex drive.
48	1175	My sex drive has stayed the same, my hair also broke off in the middle.
48	1176	You wouldn't think I sound very satisfied but I haven't had any hormonal, weight or sex drive problems which is my problem with all the other types of birth control.
48	1177	My sex drive comes and goes.
48	1178	The most major side effect I have is a decrease in sex drive which is a pretty big downside but considering I haven't experienced other side effects I rate this form of birth control highly.
48	1179	This is the only side effect that I have and it is hard because I have a very high sex drive but other than that I must honestly say that I love the Implanon a lot more than Depo and the pill.
48	1180	The only bad thing about it is my sex drive is GONE!
48	1181	I love it because my sex drive is way up.
48	1182	I believe this is the best birth control I've tried that prevents pregnancy because after 9 months of having it I have gained weight, had mood swings, and have no sex drive to even want to have sex.
48	1183	In fact I had a lost appetite, increased sex drive, and wonderful sex life knowing that babies wont evolve.
48	1184	I also had zero sex drive, and a lot of vaginal dryness.
48	1185	My sex drive is just as high as it has been.
48	1186	I wouldn't know how my sex drive is cause it has prevented most of that from happening.
48	1187	I miss my sex drive!
48	1188	And the most important thing is absolutely no sex drive!
48	1189	My sex drive is awful, I don't even think about it.
48	1190	The sex drive and the bleeding is putting a damper on my marriage, and has made my husband kranky.
48	1191	Mood swings, lots of bleeding, weight gain and no sex drive.
48	1192	I have noticed that after having the second one put in, my sex drive has gone down.
48	1193	I have also had many other side effects: hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings and irritability, no sex drive, and slight weight gain.
48	1194	I barely have a sex drive.
48	1195	No periods, no mood changes (actually improved my mental health), no change in libido.
48	1196	The only downside is that I have completely lost my libido.
48	1197	Along with the constant bleeding, I have terrible mood swings and extremely low libido.
48	1198	Which had decreased my libido almost to nothing.
48	1199	I have gained about 10kg and counting, my breasts are enormous, and have experienced some issues with libido.
48	1200	I wasn't really aware that those side effects in the past were the result of the implanon until I got the third implanon inserted six months ago, I had weeks of heavy bleeding, zero libido, weight gain like crazy in such a short time10kg!!!
48	1201	Emotional as hell, periods all over the place, appetite gone, libido gone - everything got so much better the moment I removed it.
48	1202	After a lot of contemplation and concluding that it's the birth control and not likely the breastfeeding causing this lack of libido (possibly mom-hood too), I am removing it next week and going back on pills.
48	1203	So I got the Implanon and I'm so happy I did, it lasts 3 years, my emotional state is 99% stable and 1% is like PMS, libido is a little lower, did bleed LIGHTLY for 2 weeks but haven't had a period since which I love, fertility is back to normal once taken out.
48	1204	With it came extreme mood swings, low libido, pain in my arm where it was inserted and my period lasted about 2 months.
48	1205	I am moody, no libido and sleep at least 12 hours a day.
48	1206	I have had no weight gain (despite a very good appetite and a love for cooking), but no libido at all (because of the breastfeeding as well).
48	1207	The only draw back is a drop in libido.
48	1208	The first month or so I experienced low libido, but luckily for me that issue went away.
48	1209	The worst is my very low libido.
48	1210	I had insane mood swings, my personality changed, and I had basically NO libido at all.
48	1211	To add to my low/non-existent libido, Implanon made me really dry down there so sex hurt every single time.
48	1212	I have no libido, have been placed on antidepressant from my primary physician and gained over 35 pounds!
48	1213	I'm not sure why but I think my libido has increased a lot since having the Implanon.
48	1214	My libido has been revved up.
48	1215	So far I think it is okay...but with the whole libido boost and the constant unprotected sex...wondering how likely I am to get pregnant.
48	1216	Also sometimes aggressive, and my libido dwindled to nothing (rather defeats the object).
48	1217	Noticeable increase in my libido compared to combined pill!
48	1218	My libido has fluctuated a bit every now and then (very very high just after I got it put in, and somewhat lower at the moment).
48	1219	Year 2 my period came every 2 week then off two mths plus weight gain.
48	1220	I've also experienced weight gain and sharp pains where the implant is inserted.
48	1221	However, my appetite had taken full control and weight gain came along.
48	1222	Had this in implanted on 2015 at first it was working well I had my periods regularly and no weight gain or mood swings.
48	1223	My only problem was weight gain and bloat
48	1224	My only issue is the weight gain, I gained 12kg on the implant in a matter of weeks and I cannot seem to lose it :(
48	1225	No mood swings, no binge eating, no weight gain.
48	1226	No weight gain though which is good.
48	1227	Some weight gain, but that is no bother since most contraception has it as a side effect.
48	1228	The weight gain is just too big a pr
48	1229	I cannot attribute it to weight gain (although this did happen, but was soon resolved when I started at the gym!).
48	1230	He gave me a choice of other birth controls as I have three beautiful kids I needed something as effective as the depo which 100% agreed with me no periods, no weight gain it was great.
48	1231	Worst part is the weight gain and period.
48	1232	In saying that if I didn't have the bar, I would of lost more and five months on GP and specialist both agree that I'm experiencing the side effect of weight gain as my thyroid levels are still high so I shouldn't be gaining.
48	1233	Nor can my partner as he hates how it's affecting my mood and my self confidence due to the weight gain.
48	1234	I was put on implanon a month ago and I was told that there might be some weight gain (like 5 pounds) or a chance of depression and irregular period for a while.
48	1235	Weight gain, no sec drive, depression were common thing I was reading in every thread.
48	1236	No weight gain (but I do work out and eat decently), and I haven't had feelings of depression.
48	1237	(can't say the implant had anything to do with it, but it is possible) I gained 28 lbs, and have read that it can mess with your thyroid (hence another reason for weight gain, other than retaining fluid).

48	1433	I had this is for 3 and a half years the first time , for the first year and a half my weight was fairly ok but after that the pounds started to add on I took it out and started on the injection and the weight fell off me (2 and a half stone) ..after being on that over 2 years I decided to go back on the bar thinking long term protection and hopefully the side effects won't be the same, I now have it in nearly 2 years and it's happened again I gained 2 stone again so I'm now getting it out next month even tho Its still valid for another year and I would never ever get it in again or recommend it to anyone ..even tho the protection is very good the side effects are horrendous

48	1440	10-20 lbs of weight was gained over the course of 4 1/2 years.
48	1441	It doesn't make me gain weight at all.. while I was on this I probably gained about 5-10 pounds and thats it.
48	1442	I've gained over 20 lbs with it in.
48	1443	I stopped dieting for 5 months (precisely the first 5 months I had the implant), and I gained 12 pounds in that time even with the constant physical activity.
48	1444	Even now that I have started dieting again it seems impossible to lose the pounds I gained and even more the fat in the abdominal zone.
48	1445	Also, I have had it for a year and have gained 60 lbs, I plan on switching.
48	1446	I haven't gained any weight I lost 4 pounds I was working out but stopped because I just started school and I'm working don't have the time:(

48	1459	I have gained almost 2 stone and still going!
48	1460	I had this for 4 months and gained 20lbs no matter what I've done I haven't been able to lose the weight.

48	1467	This time.. Well I've been on a constant period which is heavy causing me to feel faint and dizzy and gained weight (in which I am loosing finally) I think it's just shear luck as to whether it actually suits you.
48	1468	I've now gained about about 30lbs since getting my first rod.
48	1469	I immediately gained 30 Lbs.
48	1470	Around October 2015 I stopped having my period altogether, it was wonderful but I had gained 15 pounds.

48	1477	Half way through 2015 I started to break out and gained a lot of weight 30 kg .

48	1483	I have gained 15kgs!
48	1484	Not my first rodeo though, I'm 24 and I got pregnant for my first time when I was 17, I had an abortion then too... After the implant, I gained 30 pounds in a matter of 4 months.
48	1485	with the first one I gained around 20kgs, obviously not from the implanon itself but more likely as a result of a massive hormone change.
48	1486	On top of that, I gained 15 pounds and COULD NOT LOSE IT.
48	1487	I got the implant out 7 months later and lost the weight I had gained and started feeling better.
48	1488	I have gained some weight but not much.
48	1489	I have gained 25lb in a year of having it and I work out 2-3 days a week doing kick boxing and cross fit which I never worked out before this year and I keep gaining.
48	1490	The one thing that is the only reason I would get it out would be the amount of weight I've gained.
48	1491	I've gained about 40 pounds.
48	1492	It gave me mood swings and I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster, not to mention the 25lbs I gained :(  Just had it removed and I already feel much better.
48	1493	I have gained 30lbs.
48	1494	Recently I have ran out of the nueva ring and even with so much time in the gym it's like a gained 5 lbs in my sleep.
48	1495	I had the implanon in for the whole 3 years I gained around 50 lbs I had no energy to do anything.
48	1496	I've gained a fair amount of weight (15  pounds) and it seems to keep coming.
48	1497	I've gained a lot of weight and considering I have bipolar disorder my moods did change but they have gotten worse since I've been on the implanon but other than all the complaints I have it works the way it is supposed to
48	1498	I am excited and I hope my body gets back to normal (I really just want to lose the 25 lbs I gained).
48	1499	I love how easy it is but in 9 months I have gained 20 pounds and am getting really sad.
48	1500	Then I gained a lot of weight, had really bad depression with suicidal thoughts, my body always hurt.
48	1501	I gained 40 lbs, and barely ate anything.
48	1502	Other than that I only gained about 5 pounds.
48	1503	After 4 months the flow did stop how ever I have gained a lot of weight 14lbs.
48	1504	So when 2013 rolled around I gained a dramatic amount of weight.
48	1505	By the time I took it out 2 days ago I had gained 60 pounds in 2 yrs ..
48	1506	I have gained a significant amount of weight since, however my dr pointed out that I had been rapidly gaining weight before(thanks college!).
48	1507	I had this implanted June 22nd 2015 August started feeling pregnant thought it was just the side effects gained 15 lbs all belly!!!
48	1508	After 5,6 months of implanon I gained 15 to 20 pounds.
48	1509	I have a had the Implanon since July 2015 and although I LOVE not having periods, I have gained some weight.
48	1510	Only problem I have is the weight I've gained.
48	1511	I haven't gained weight, and I think a lot of women like to blame birth control for their absent minded decisions.
48	1512	Disadvantage for me, I start getting a lot of spots, and gained 10 kg.
48	1513	I have also gained weight.
48	1514	I gained weight, was moody (like evil moody), I Had period for like a whole month & swear that was a miscarriage too.
48	1515	I gained at least 15 lbs, I go to the gym regularly and it's nearly impossible for me to lose weight.
48	1516	I instantly gained 15 pounds i hardly ever got periods Maybe every 6-7 months rarely had them went a whole yr with out period but had severe cramps.I was Very hormonal but I will say even though I had all these problems Implanon did what it was supposed to do and I do not regret getting it 3 months after getting it removed I became pregnant with my first child.
48	1517	On top of that I gained 10 lbs and no matter what I would do, I could not loose any weight!
48	1518	I have gained about 20kg in 2 years period.
48	1519	Also I have gained 20 pounds since I started on it.
48	1520	I've gained some weight too but my main issue is the bleeding.
48	1521	I had it in for 3 months and gained a rediculous amount of weight and never had a period.
48	1522	The main reason is I have gained A LOT of weight with this, and also I feel is the cause of my acne/mood swings.
48	1523	The first 2 years I gained 30 pounds and I became very depressed and anxious ( which is still going on in year 7).
48	1524	But recently I've been bleeding for two weeks straight, very strange, but I do work with all girls... Why I rated it a 3 is because I gained 60 pounds.
48	1525	Since I went back on it I gained 5 pounds.
48	1526	I gained some weight.
48	1527	I've also gained 15ish pounds.
48	1528	I was always skinny, then gained 30  pounds from this.
48	1529	I didn't get pregnant however it did throw my hormones off & I gained weight (25lbs) from having this product inside me for years.
48	1530	Then i took a small break from it and got the shot (instantly gained almost 10 pounds), so back to it i went.
48	1531	I gained about 60lbs, very emotional and always crying, my hair fell out and is extremely thin now, and I would come on my period 3 times a month.
48	1532	I've read that woman gained weight on this, but for me it was the complete opposite, I lost a lot of weight.. Plus constant mood swings!
48	1533	I have bad sharp pain in my arm, I've gained 44lbs since then, I can't even carry my babies without my arm feeling numb and in pain.
48	1534	I have in total almost gained 30 pounds!!
48	1535	I've gained about 8 pounds within those months.
48	1536	Not only have I gained weight, but its also making me break out really bad.
48	1537	I've gained about 30lbs, my period comes ones every 3 months.
48	1538	I haven't gained any weight (yet) amd haven't had an increased appetite.
48	1539	I've gained weight but I'm also not the healthiest eater lol.
48	1540	I've also gained about 20 lbs since insertion.
48	1541	I used to be on the pill but it made me ill. For me the first 3 months my periods were irregular but afterwards I got one every month for about 5 days, me and my boyfriend have unprotected sex and no babies so far, I get moodswings but what girl doesn't, and I haven't gained weight at all either its the perfect contraception for me plus reduction of breakouts :)
48	1542	I gained 25 lbs in the first two months, I'm irrationally moody, and now going on week 7 of continuous period.
48	1543	I slowly started gaining my weight back and extra weight, I've gained 15 pounds back but I'm eating healthier and exercising more than I did when I lost my weight.
48	1544	I have not gained weight of had any changes to my skin.
48	1545	I loved it at 1st I was on depo before I switched because I got tired of getting a shot every 12 weeks (3 months) once I got on this birth control everything was fine and then all the sudden I started slowly gaining weight and it wasn't coming off I didn't mind it at 1st because I was so skinny I gained at least 60 pounds and I've been on it for 2 years and 3 months I just got off of it today I'm going to c if I can loose any of this weight it also always made me very hungry all day long.
48	1546	So im not so sure as to if I have gained weight from this product or from having a baby or even if it's from one or the other and im just overweight.
48	1547	I've gained 40 pounds and even though I exercise daily.
48	1548	I got my Implanon out 2 days ago after having it for the full 3 years , I loved it for the fact I didn't have to worry about it or getting pregnant, downside is I gained about 4stone and I'm only 20!
48	1549	However, on the other hand I have been on the implant for 1 year and 8 months, and have gained SO much weight.
48	1550	I have gained upwards of 30 pounds, and I have been trying to figure out why.
48	1551	I have however gained almost 100 pounds.
48	1552	Since then I have already gained 20 pounds.
48	1553	I have gained nearly 35 pounds in two and a half years and it's impossible to lose weight.
48	1554	I have gained 20lbs so far.
48	1555	The only downhill is that in the 2 years I've being using it I gained at least 45 pounds which sucks because I tried everything to lose the weight but nothing seems to work for me.
48	1556	But now after 8 months I have NOT gained weight or gotten a period.
48	1557	The only thing that I didn't like was that I gained 30lbs.
48	1558	She didn't have any problem or anything but she just gained weight.
48	1559	No mood swings, gained a little weight but I don't think it all has to do with the Implanon.
48	1560	In the beginning I gained a pound or two but realized its only because Implanon made me more hungry so I regulated my eating patterns and now I haven't gained any weight.
48	1561	Implanon does it's job, but I do have really crazy mood swings and I have gained 10 pounds since I've had it in (even though I workout regularly).
48	1562	I have been on the Implanon for two years and it's OK expect I have gained weight and I still have my period I think it's because the day I got it my period was on and it's lasted for a month then it went off for like 2 months now it's regular.
48	1563	Other than that I have gained weight but like most people that's not just because of the birth control.
48	1564	I have gained weight (10 lbs in 3 years) but I'm not blaming that completely on birth control.
48	1565	I gained about 20 pounds in the first 3 months, which I could not lose no matter what I did.
48	1566	After I had it implanted I gained 30lbs in a matter of 3 months.
48	1567	A month ago my breasts started swelling up terribly, I gained about 7 lbs, and I become very moody.
48	1568	I have a high metabolism and have never gained any weight with it!
48	1569	I haven't gained weight.
48	1570	Its only been 3 months and I have gained 4 kilos.
48	1571	I lost the 20 pounds I gained on this medicine.
48	1572	Over the past three years I've gained quite a bit of weight and this is the only reason I'm moving back to the pill.
48	1573	I have gained weight, 6 kg.
48	1574	I've gained about thirty pounds, but I've also got other health issues going on so I'm not ready to blame it all on the implant.
48	1575	I broke out like crazy gained a lot of weight didn't have my period for like a year and then it would come like 4 times a year.
48	1576	I gained 10 lbs in just one year, and during this second year I have gained 5 more lbs.
48	1577	I gained 30 pounds within two months.
48	1578	I have not gained any weight however I have lost all interest in having sex.
48	1579	My hair is falling out I have the worst anxiety and mood swings and have gained over 30lbs since on it, no amount of exercise and diet can help.
48	1580	I gained 20 pounds in 7 months and it was pretty much impossible for me to lose weight.
48	1581	I have not gained weight i have just lost mad weight and it sucks I weigh less then I've ever weighed before.
48	1582	I gained 50 pounds.
48	1583	The first 6 months were okay only had 2 periods on it not got pregnant but ive gained a lot of weight more than I did when I gave birth.
48	1584	I have gained 20 plus pounds but I know a majority of it is my diet and exercise so I highly recommend this to women who want something long term.
48	1585	Since getting the Implanon I have gained at least 7 pounds.
48	1586	I gained a few pounds but it's my fault.
48	1587	The bad things are I have not gotten my period ever since I mean it is good who wouldn't be happy about that more than 1 year without a period, the bad thing is I think all those things are retained in my body, also I have gained so much weight, I stand at 190 lbs.
48	1588	March 2012 I instantly gained 15 pounds and had a period that lasted almost 2 weeks.
48	1589	I have not gained any weight but I also exercise 4 to 5 times a week!
48	1590	Unfortunately, in these past 2 years I have gained a considerable amount of weight.
48	1591	I've gained some weight but not a lot.
48	1592	I've gained a bit of weight and have found it a bit harder to lose any extra but if you exercise and eat healthy it shouldn't be a problem.
48	1593	I have also gained weight (8lbs) but that could be due to the whole "freshman fifteen" it's hard to tell.
48	1594	I gained only around eight pounds (which was a lot for me because I have always been petite).
48	1595	I have gained weight (5 lbs) but its hard to tell if that's just due to aging, I'm almost 33 or not.
48	1596	I gained 5kgs, and would go through these cycles - two weeks on, two weeks off - of non-stop bleeding, mood swings that nearby altered my personality, and a huge increase in anxiety.
48	1597	I was losing weight and then all of a sudden I gained the weight back.
48	1598	I have gained just a little bit of weight, I'm on & off of my period about every other 2 weeks.
48	1599	I gained a substantial amount of weight even though my lifestyle has not changed and I am constantly having breakthrough bleeding.
48	1600	But, in the past 6 months have gained 20 lbs!
48	1601	I have gained maybe five pounds since starting this, but also haven't been keeping up on working out or eating healthy so who knows which it's from.
48	1602	Within the 1st year I had very few side effects within the second year I gained 14 lbs and now I'm on the last year and afraid I'm only going to gain more.
48	1603	At first I lost weight, now I have gained 15 pounds.
48	1604	I have gained about 5 lbs or so and I continue to have periods.
48	1605	Have gained weight.
48	1606	I have gained roughly 3 and half stone since using Implanon which I am very unhappy about and have tried numerous ways to lose (I even purchased a treadmill for home use and it has had little effect)!
48	1607	I have had a regular period the last 3 1/2 years, the procedure (put in and removed) was a simple out-patient procedure with minimal pain, haven't gained any weight, long lasting protection, don't have to remember to take it, and the most important is that it is doing it's job!
48	1608	I started out weighing 150 and I rapidly gained weight putting me up to 210lbs.
48	1609	I haven't gained anymore weight after those first few months but I am certainly not able to lose any of it.
48	1610	I haven't gained weight either.
48	1611	I have gained 20 pounds since having the Implanon inserted.
48	1612	I've gained about 15 pounds over the 3 years, but think it's mostly because of college and poor choices, not my Implanon.
48	1613	I have also gained a total of 10lbs which I can't say it totally caused by Implanon.
48	1614	I'm almost at a year now, and so far I've gained about 20 pounds and have not changed my eating or exercise habits, and every few months I end up thinking I'm pregnant.
48	1615	I gained about 30 lbs.
48	1616	Oh and I have gained so much weight.
48	1617	I have gained 24 pounds and I have not been able to get the weight off.
48	1618	I gained 15 pounds and had terrible cravings and some hair loss.
48	1619	I have gained over twenty pounds.
48	1620	I gained 20 pounds, I changed my eating habits and was even working out with no weight loss..It was really making me depressed..and I was constantly moody and easy irritated..
48	1621	I gained 17 pounds in 6 months.
48	1622	I had Implanon put in on Mid November of 2009, I have had trouble losing weight and yes I have gained weight easier than normal but other than this I absolutely love my Implanon!
48	1623	At first I had very crazy mood swings and I have gained about 15 lbs.
48	1624	But I have been on it for 10 months now and have gained 50lbs so I am going tomorrow to have it removed.
48	1625	Always exhausted and I've gained weight.
48	1626	I have gained about 5 pounds had one heavy period and feel constantly bloated.
48	1627	I have even gained quite a bit of weight also... My relationship is even at risk, and its not worth it!
48	1628	Along with heavy, long periods, I have gained 30lbs.
48	1629	I also have not gained any weight with good eating habits and a little workout I am healthy and have lost ten pounds since being on the birth control.
48	1630	I've gained just a little bit of weight, but nothing the gym can help with.
48	1631	After trying the pills, and the Depo shot I gained weight.
48	1632	I have gained weight, 10 pounds.
48	1633	I have gained over 40 lbs since getting this in January 2011 it is now November.
48	1634	Barely bled, only gained a few lbs and no other side effects.
48	1635	I have also gained about 30lbs without changing my diet or lifestyle at all, as I am an active, healthy person.
48	1636	Since I have been on it I have gained close to 40 lbs.
48	1637	It was not ideal for me however because I gained about 20 lbs in one year from it and bled every single day of that year.
48	1638	Nor have I gained an abnormal amount of weight.
48	1639	The only bad part was removal: I (intentionally) gained about 30lbs while on Implanon and the doctor had a hard time removing the implant: multiple incisions and significant discomfort.
48	1640	I lost a lot of hair, constantly bleeding mood swings and I gained a few pounds.
48	1641	I gained weight but that is also due to me being away at college.
48	1642	I am always hungry and have gained about 10-13 pounds.
48	1643	I have gained weight.
48	1644	I've gained 10 lbs out of no where.
48	1645	Over the 3 years I gained 65lbs despite a healthy diet and exercise routine.
48	1646	I have gained weight and have a really hard time losing any weight despite calorie counting and lots of cardio at the gym.
48	1647	However, in the first month alone I gained 20  pounds, that despite healthy eating and exercise would not disappear.
48	1648	I gained about fifteen pounds but I was 100 lbs.
48	1649	Also, I gained 5lbs in about 2 weeks, but thankfully I'm dieting and exercising and I lost that weight!
48	1650	I have gained 20 pounds, and I am on my period constantly.
48	1651	I haven't gained any weight either.
48	1652	I was on Depo and I gained a lot of weight.
48	1653	I have had severe mood swings, I gained 110 pounds in the year I've had it.
48	1654	I have gained 25 to 30 pounds but I thought it was all from my eating habits.
48	1655	When I was on the pill I gained some weight but on the Implanon I have been able to keep my weight under control.
48	1656	Now about 9 months later I've gained over 25 pounds, I'm tired and have periods lasting over 2 weeks.
48	1657	Plus I always gained weight from estrogen pills and soon as I went off the pill I lost 23lbs in two months.
48	1658	I've had it for about 9 months now and I've gained about 12 pounds.
48	1659	I have gained 30 pounds on it and have horrible mood swings, exhaustion and fatigue.
48	1660	I also haven't gained any weight.
48	1661	Biggest problem is that I have gained nearly 30 pounds since I have been on it.
48	1662	I also gained weight after being under 110 lbs my entire life.
48	1663	I also got one negative side effect I gained over 40 pounds since I got the Implonan.
48	1664	I have gained about 5-10 pounds but I am not a very active person.
48	1665	I haven't gained weight no mood swings just my normal attitude and I haven't gotten my period for like a year and a half and love it but I came here to find out if that was normal.
48	1666	I haven't gained weight, which I was hoping I would.
48	1667	I gotten hot flashes and gained weight.
48	1668	I also have gained weight, but not a lot.
48	1669	The reason why I am not a big fan of this is because when I got pregnant with my first child I weighed 170 pounds I gained 12 pounds during pregnancy and dropped it almost immediately.
48	1670	Got pregnant again gained 19 pounds, lost 9 pounds by the time got the Implanon put in.
48	1671	I am now a lovely 202 pounds, so on average using this product I have gained about 11 pounds a year.
48	1672	I've gained 25 pounds and have hair loss.
48	1673	I love the fact that I haven't gained any weight the only problem I do have are the mood swings.
48	1674	I have gained 12 pounds.
48	1675	I gained a lot of weight on the Depo, but once on Implanon I lost 20lbs.
48	1676	I haven't gained any weight but my appetite goes back and forth for one day.
48	1677	I have had the Implanon since October 2009 and since then I have gained 50  pounds.
48	1678	Since then, I have gained over 40 pounds!
48	1679	I have gained about 8 pounds in the last year but I'm not sure if it was from the Implanon.
48	1680	And I have gained weight not a lot but about 11 pounds since November.
48	1681	I have gained so much weight, and I can't seem to lose it....
48	1682	I'm not sure if I gained weight because of this product, but I was naturally always skinny before this product.
48	1683	At first it was every other week, now I will be off for like 3 or 4 days and I have also gained 40 pounds, extremely moody, irritable, stomach pains etc.... and drying of my scalp.
48	1684	I have gained some weight but I rather gain some weight then have another baby.
48	1685	Went to the Gyno yesterday and since starting back in August I've gained 30 lbs.
48	1686	I don't get my periods, I don't have mood swings and the weight I gained I lost with a little bit of effort (mind you it was only 5kg).
48	1687	I have gained over 56 pounds and have had really bad back pain and my husband says I have become really hormonal.
48	1688	By December 2009 I had gained 65 LBS.
48	1689	I've gained 50 lbs and counting, constant bleeding ever since I got it; severe anxiety/depression and mood swings.
48	1690	Since then, I have gained 15 additional pounds to the weight I had gained due to pregnancy.
48	1691	I have used implanon since january 17, 2008...At first I didn't feel anything and thought this was the best method of birth control...However as time progressed I have experienced a lot of negative symptoms....I have gained weight, my breast are constantly in pain, I have lower back pain and my mood swings have become the worst.
48	1692	I liked it at first because I was living with my boyfriend at the time and it avoided pregnancy but after having it for a few months I gained 20 pounds!
48	1693	I've gained some extra pounds and my eating habit has been the same.
48	1694	I was moody and I gained about 4 pounds even though I did not change my eating habits.
48	1695	Since then, all side effects have disappeared, I lost the 4 pounds I gained (without changing my eating havits) and I'm completely satisfied with my Implanon implant.
48	1696	I may have gained about 5 pounds, but I won't blame the Implanon, I have been bad with my eating habits.
48	1697	I have gained no weight or have had my mood effected or any other bad side effects.
48	1698	I gained 25lbs.
48	1699	I feel no sexual desire anymore since having the rod put in and I have gained exactly a stone in weight.
48	1700	Since I got this birth control implanted I've gained 20 lbs and have experienced irregular bleeding.
48	1701	I have gained 48lbs.
48	1702	I am wondering if I gained weight from it or if it was just me gaining weight.
48	1703	I haven't gained any weight and any moodiness was probably something I would have experienced without all the hormones.
48	1704	The Implanon has been hurting since I had it done, I have gained 25lbs because of this as well.
48	1705	A few months after getting it implanted I noticed that my mood had gone down, I began to have mood swings, major anxiety and daily nausea.
48	1706	The day following my insertion of the implanon I got extreme nausea and debilitating fever that lasted the whole night.
48	1707	I had no appetite and waves of nausea would occur before a fever.
48	1708	I felt better for a week or two but still had nausea.
48	1709	I was always depressed, horrible mood swings, I got severe nausea and got sick to my stomach on it.
48	1710	I did experience nausea and dizziness in the first couple weeks as my body adjusted to the hormones.
48	1711	And I've had some days when I felt dizzy and nausea.
48	1712	Having it removed also made me very sick (dizziness, nausea ect).
48	1713	I haven't had any other side effects such as the nausea and head aches like it said I would.
48	1714	I had severe nausea, dizziness and spells of anxiety for weeks after removal.
48	1715	A little nausea and a sore arm for about a month.
48	1716	The first day I had nausea but the doctor told me that would be expected.
48	1717	Dizziness and nausea!
48	1718	I have nearly CONSTANT fatigue, nausea a lot of the time.
48	1719	I am in the beginning of my third year of having the Implanon, and the worst part for me is the nausea.
48	1720	I liked it OK at first, had some minor vertigo and nausea when the hormones began kicking in.
48	1721	The only down side I've experienced has been some nausea (particularly in the morning).
48	1722	No mood swings, no nausea, no anything.
48	1723	Also I have had nausea almost every single day for the last three or four months.
48	1724	In the past week have experienced breast tenderness, nausea, lower back pain and slight dizziness which I worried was due to pregnancy.
48	1725	The biggest side effect I've noticed has been my weight, I have lost a lot of weight and have nearly no appetite and when I do eat I feel nauseous.
48	1726	I felt really nauseous when I first got it so I could barely eat but I've lost weight and have remained very small.
48	1727	It started with my period but with that I became very nauseous, depressed, anxious, and worried.
48	1728	I would have times where I would be nauseous for a week and a half at a time accompanied by smell sensitivity.
48	1729	I did also began to feel very nauseous and even have a loss of appetite sometimes , after the the 3rd month of the implant the break outs have went away and I have put on a few pounds but more in my thigh and gluteal region.
48	1730	I'm nauseous and dizzy constantly.
48	1731	I am also nauseous, kind of often, but other than that I am okay.
48	1732	I was nauseous for the first week, and now am noticing a bit of emotional liability (I cry at the drop of a hat, I can't watch tv without crying).
48	1733	The day I got it inserted and the day after I was very nauseous and dizzy.
48	1734	I feel so dizzy or nervous and my period has been going on for months.
48	1735	It wasn't sore getting it removed but constant dizzy spells and weakness.
48	1736	I never wanted sex, my hair was falling out, my back and my head hurt, when I would stand I would become dizzy, pretty much you name it, I had it!
48	1737	I get dizzy alot and it scares me having our little girl while im driving.
48	1738	I was a little dizzy for about 10 minutes after but was fine after that.
48	1739	I'm moody as and I'm always dizzy.
48	1740	I was sick, light-headed and dizzy.
48	1741	The third day after insertion I felt really dizzy.
48	1742	I suffer with dizziness, fatigue, loss of appetite and now anxiety/panic attacks, I can't even go to the grocery store without having these attacks.
48	1743	I’ve experienced some depression & mood swing throughout
48	1744	I chose the implanon after 5 years of being on the deposit injection (I began having the most awful mood swing after 3 years or so on it).
48	1745	I just had it last month and so far so good, I have not had any major side effect except for a little mood swing and I have not had my period since am exclusively breastfeeding my 4 month old.
48	1746	I cry for no reason and mood swing are crazy.
48	1747	Mood swings, anger, irritability is through the roof.
48	1748	It just makes me feel sad and I have a lot of mood swings I really don't want it anymore
48	1749	I do experience more mood swings and often cry for no reason.
48	1750	I've had no other side affects, aside from maybe being a bit more moody and having more mood swings.

48	1752	I have had a period everyday I have been on the implanon and bad mood swings.

48	1754	Severe mood swings almost bipolar type.

48	1756	the mood swings went away in a couple months.
48	1757	It look me about 3mos of mood swings then I stabled out.
48	1758	The constant MOOD SWINGS, TERRIBLE ACNE AND CONSTANT NON STOP HEAVY PERIODS are just too much.
48	1759	I don't have mood swings or feel highly emotional, I don't get bad 'periods' they are usually light.
48	1760	I've only been on the implant since July and its September now and I still have my period...my mood swings are off the wall and worst of all my boobs and behind have both gotten smaller..the thing that worries me the most is I weigh the same but I feel so different.
48	1761	No mood swings.
48	1762	I had the implant inserted in 2014, I've had it in for 2 years and I my periods and mood swings have been dreadful, I was told by the doctors it would take about 7 months to actually settle and not to have intercourse with my partner until it had!
48	1763	I did have some mood swings, but I thought it was just normal considering the extra hormone in my body.
48	1764	Ever since I got it in, it has been a non-stop emotional roller coaster, my mood swings are out of control.
48	1765	My mood swings were horrendous and I was so uptight and moody.
48	1766	All it has done is make my depression and anxiety worse and cause really bad mood swings.
48	1767	I can honestly say I hate this form of birth control I never would get a period until a few months ago and for the past 2 months it has been non stop my mood swings are everywhere I'm gaining weight like crazy this birth control is not even worth it.
48	1768	The only serious side effects were emotional lability (probably the most concerning), rapid mood swings and some slight depression but honestly?
48	1769	This is my second Implanon would not recommend at all....first one was okay for the first 2 years until I started bleeding which never stopped when I woke in the morning I would stand up and be absolutely covered in blood it was that bad.....I lost 2 stone in weight my mood swings were all over the place and it affected my relationship.

48	1779	After having it inserted 6 months ago, at month two I started developing horrible, debilitating anxiety, sadness...mood swings.
48	1780	I really can't stress enough how much it affected me mentally though, it was intense and everyone around me had to go through my terrible mood swings and anger too.

48	1874	I have had some mood swings but I can contribute most of them to everyday life stressors.

48	1895	I loved not having a period however I began to experience mood swings, since August 09.

48	1897	I've had my occasional mood swings and excessive periods but I would rather deal with that then to have a baby!
48	1898	The only negative thing I can say about Implanon is that I have experienced temporary mood swings, but other than that I love it.

48	1912	My mood swings are making me reconsider this birth control because I feel it's affecting my relationship.
48	1913	The mood swings I have now are ridiculous.
48	1914	Sometimes I have mood swings but I'm unsure if it's a side effect of the Implanon or due to the fact that I've had depression in the past.

48	1916	Random mood swings sometimes.
48	1917	Compared to previous attempts at birth control my temperament and mood swings have leveled out.
48	1918	I cannot get aroused, have vaginal dryness, abdominal pain, and mood swings.
48	1919	I don't really care about the random periods because I've suffered from this my entire life, but I'm coming to the end of my 3 years, and my mood swings around the time of my period are HORRIBLE.
48	1920	I had really bad mood swings so I went to my doctor and she put me on Prozac to calm me down.

48	1923	I have ups and downs with mood swings.

48	1943	Mood changes, no drive.

48	1945	Besides the major mood changes, Implanon was good for me.
48	1946	I haven't had any real mood changes depression like I would get while I was on the pill.
48	1947	It makes me quite nervous!
48	1948	It made me really, depressed, had major weight loss, nervous, paranoid, anxiety, and I wasn't myself.
48	1949	I can go a month without a period then I'll have one then go a week without bleeding then start again for another week or 2, I have gotten to the point of always being nervous about driving going to work or even being surrounded by people which I grew up in and around a big family so not myself at all!!

48	1956	I was nervous and first and had a list of questions for my doctor.
48	1957	After reading the negative reviews of implanon I will admit that I was slightly nervous to get the birth control.
48	1958	I was a little nervous as I've never been on a progestin only birth control method (always been on combination hormones), but so far, so great!
48	1959	I did have a bruise that lasted about 2-3 weeks and my period that I had when I got it implanted lasted about 2 weeks as well (which made me nervous I was going to be a constant bleeder on this!
48	1960	I started looking into Implanon several years ago and was very nervous about all the negative reviews I found.
48	1961	I was really nervous about trying Implanon because of all the reviews I read.
48	1962	Insertion was quick and simple and nothing to be nervous over.
48	1963	At first I was a little nervous because of all the bad reviews I read but went along with it anyway.
48	1964	I also got this put in when it first came back on the market and was nervous about it but now I wouldn't choose any other birth control.
48	1965	I never write reviews but I was SO nervous about getting the Implanon after all the negative reviews and I wanted to let people know that is NOT the case for everyone.

48	1970	I'm constantly feeling lazy, depressed, and suuuuuuper anxious.
48	1971	I also got super depressed & anxious and no one believed the birth control was doing it.
48	1972	In the beginning I had no emotional or hormonal side effects...about 6 months in I became very paranoid, moody, anxious, emotional, and was becoming depressed before I finally had it taken out.
48	1973	I think I am going to remove it because I have also noticed that it has made me super anxious.
48	1974	Since the insertion I’m emotional, sensitive, irritable, anxious, depressed - a constant state of PMS.
48	1975	My marriage has taken a hit from all of this and I am anxious to have Implanon removed!
48	1976	I'm anxious for the bleeding to stop completely but other than that it's GREAT!
48	1977	Not to mention, in the past year that I have been having these problems, I have become depressed, anxious, moody, and my patience has worn very VERY thin with not only my fiance and daughter, but with people in general.
48	1978	I was anxious to get it after having my son.
48	1979	Although a good form of contraception for preventing babies, I have found it made me moody, anxious and at times down-right depressed.
48	1980	Since March I have also been very depressed, anxious, and just felt PMS all the time; my OBGYN put me on antidepressants for a few months, she said that it should not be related to the Implanon, but I cannot help but feel that it is since it coordinates with my bleeding.
48	1981	I've had this birth control for a year now and at first things were going good, I only had a period once and never had one since but now I have super bad anxiety, I would constantly think I was pregnant, would waste my money on pregnancy test even though I am NOT pregnant and my depression was very bad and honestly , I really don't think it's worth it at all.
48	1982	I suffered terrible anxiety and depression which worsened to me not even wanting to leave the house and waking up daily thinking I'd be better off not here.
48	1983	Developed/diagnosed severe OCD, severe physical generalised anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder.
48	1984	I would be extremely fatigued, I had extreme anxiety at night whether eating or no sleep at night, I did exercise and diet but still had a lot of obsesive cravings all the time.
48	1985	I really do think Nexplanon made my depression & anxiety so much worse.
48	1986	Ever since I've had Implanon inserted, my anxiety became worse than ever.
48	1987	If you suffer from any type of anxiety or depression, DO  NOT get the implant!
48	1988	I have also experienced decreased anxiety and more regular moods.
48	1989	I have my own bouts of anxiety and depression so that may contribute to some of my issues.
48	1990	I was so caught up worrying that my depression and anxiety would arise as a side effect that I didn't realise it was actually the bar causing the sudden change in my skin.
48	1991	Well, it got worse, and a few months ago I was put on medicine for anxiety.
48	1992	It's been ruining my relationship with my boyfriend because I constantly ask myself if he loves me anymore and things like that (I know he does but the implanon says different) it's given me severe anxiety, super upset and breaking down in tears everyday and have an empty feeling in my stomach.
48	1993	I had terrible anxiety and depression.
48	1994	I have put on 10kgs, sometimes I don't have my period for 2 months then other times it will be every week on and off heavy bleeding, I am so lethargic and never feel like going anywhere or doing anything and I've also been diagnosed with anxiety since being on this.
48	1995	I am 20 and have always had anxiety about BC and not trusting that it is working (I could always use it exactly like I'm supposed to and would still make myself sick over if I was pregnant or not) this has definitely lessened that feeling!!
48	1996	For the first 4-5 months that I had Implanon I suffered some pretty terrible mental side effects, including depression and some pretty brutal anxiety.
48	1997	I get anxiety and depression so badly this past year.
48	1998	I lost a relationship that was very important to me because the anxiety made life unbearable.
48	1999	The Implant caused me to suffer with the most crippling depression and anxiety and I had counselling for this (all gone now since its removal)?
48	2000	It made my anxiety uncontrollable which made me depressed.
48	2001	I have now been on the birth control pill for almost two months so everything has subsided except the anxiety.
48	2002	I have never had anxiety in my life and now deal with it on a regular basis thanks to the implanon!
48	2003	The day right after getting this put in, I was very suicidal (never happened to me before) and my anxiety was through the roof.
48	2004	This calmed down after a few days, but the anxiety stilled showed up on and off.
48	2005	I did not gain weight, nor did this change my appetite, but the bleeding, anxiety, and depression were enough for me to quit.
48	2006	I am having massive anxiety, depression.
48	2007	I've always been depressed and have had anxiety for awhile now but it's not stopping me and I surely don't freak out on my husband nor my children.
48	2008	I had a little anxiety about the insertion but it really was quick and pretty painless.
48	2009	I'm depressed and have bad anxiety.
48	2010	Since November of last year I have become horribly depressed and my anxiety is through the roof.
48	2011	I'm on antidepressants and anxiety medicines since I've gotten the Implanon in.
48	2012	At first I did get anxiety pretty bad but it went away quickly.
48	2013	The anxiety leading up to the insertion is the worst part.
48	2014	Insertion was SUPER easy, the anxiety was the worst part.
48	2015	The insertion caused some anxiety for me but it was over quickly and essentially painless.
48	2016	Oh and did I mention the anxiety!
48	2017	HOWEVER, the Implanon made me more moody, emotional, depressed, and anxiety ridden.
48	2018	Now I have to take antidepressants and anxiety medications.
48	2019	I am now taking depression and anxiety pill because they think it was postpartum depression.
48	2020	I cry all the time for no reasons and I am now taking depression  and anxiety pills.
48	2021	The anxiety is the worst part.
48	2022	Recently though I have been experiencing horrible breast pain like you get when starting your period or when pregnant.
48	2023	(Never been pregnant but friends say it's similar) and it's been going on for almost 3 weeks.The only issue is every few months for about a week I get bad breast pain.
48	2024	I had the Implanon inserted Feb.15 2011, now it's a little hard to to compare to some experiences because I was on Depo before the insertion, but the only side effects that I have had is the occasional breast tenderness.
48	2025	I do experience breast tenderness around the time of my menstrual period (which by the way is regular.. 3-5 days a month) and that only lasts as long as the menstrual cycle itself.
48	2026	The first three years I had no side effects, other than some breast tenderness and the implant site was sore for a few days.
48	2027	Also sore breasts irregular periods and insomnia.
48	2028	Though I do have mild PMS (sore breasts, bloating).
48	2029	A side effect which I experience quite often, is sore breasts.
48	2030	I'm now getting sore breasts and hoping that the next 18 months go okay.
48	2031	I figured it was a yeast infection but they don't smell.
48	2032	On top of constant yeast infections and discharge.
48	2033	I haven't had a period, but I have had more yeast infections.
48	2034	I used to have NuvaRing and it caused many yeast infections and bacterial vaginitis.
48	2035	I keep having yeast infections.
49	1	Never have I had such severe acne in all my life.
49	2	The worst part of it was the humongous cystic acne it caused all over my face.
49	3	I am on month 2 & can say that the current side effects I experience are acne, loss of appetite, striking pains/cramps, & DEFINITELY nausea.
49	4	Since I started it 5 w ago I've gotten acne, stomach pains, cramps but most of all, I am angry, sad, all symptoms of PPD.
49	5	Finally called my doc and switching off it to something with out hormones mainly to fight  this bad case of acne.
49	6	While on Nora-BE I had a lot of painful acne and breakthrough bleeding.
49	7	I've been on several types and have never experienced acne like I did on Nora be.
49	8	It caused me to have painful cystic acne all over my face, the worst was by my mouth and chin.
49	9	Cons: horrible mood swings, more acne than ever and I've always had great skin-this has made me more self-conscious than ever, lowered libido, I'm mean and nasty to my boyfriend for no reason and it seems uncontrollable.
49	10	I had issues on this medication the first few months like extremely bad headaches almost everyday, horrible acne, mood swings and irregular periods.
49	11	My migraines have lessened now however it is horrible acne that bothers me the most.
49	12	I got a little bit more acne then usual.
49	13	Only downside is I do notice a few more acne breakouts at time, but it's better than having pregnancy scares!
49	14	Hardly any acne, no weight gain, no moodiness.
49	15	This pill is great I been taking it for 2 months no weight gain, no acne, my period is normal, my sex drive is very high..I do get moody but I can control that so I say that this is a great birthcontrol...especially since I'm breast feeding
49	16	I had no migraines but what I experienced was worse: acne breakouts all over my body which I have never experienced before this pill, frequent spotting but no actual period, bloating and cramping all of the time, drastic weight gain, zero sex drive, foggy brain and worst of all it made me so moody.
49	17	I didn't break out in acne, I didn't gain weight, (I'm very active, if that matters), I say it takes a couples months for your body to get used to the new hormone, but it's nothing intolerable once time has passed.
49	18	I've actually noticed my acne improving and haven't noticed any weight changes.
49	19	My boobs have been sore, acne at first but that's gone.
49	20	I've always had hormonal acne but it has not made it any worse.
49	21	The first time I was on this (before baby #2) it was effective for almost a year then decided to stop taking it after experiencing anxiety, chest pain, acne and I swear it made my BP go up.
49	22	Neck/back/chest itchy rash and terrible acne.
49	23	Some back and facial acne but NO PMSING!
49	24	I originally wanted a combo birth control to help with acne.
49	25	Destroyed my face in the first month, never had this kind of acne AND dry skin patches in my life, also never been on this kind of BC in my life, I've been off it for almost 2 weeks and still recovering, if that!
49	26	Headaches, weight gain, depression, panic attacks, super dry vag and cystic acne.
49	27	I experienced acne, mood swings and my cycle would come on at weird times and stay on for 7-10 days as opposed to my usual 3 - 5 days.
49	28	Weight gain, acne, anxiousness, depression, fatigue, and BLOATING.
49	29	I did feel like I lost a lot of hair and my acne flares up once in awhile, but drinking a lot of water helps the acne.
49	30	I finally stopped taking it the second week into the 3rd month because I got terrible acne like I've never had in my life and my period, again.
49	31	I don't really have PMS, but on this drug, I get mood swings, painful constipation, acne and a sore genital tract.
49	32	After starting this birth control, I experienced mood swings of irritability and anger within taking the first pill, I also experienced severe bloating and bad acne.
49	33	What I've experienced: breakthrough heavy bleeding the second week of pills, no period during last week of pills, nausea, headaches, weight gain, acne, cramping, and just an overall feeling of not feeling well.
49	34	Only thing is I had a little more acne than normal but I had no pregnancy using this, its good if you don't wanna get pregnant
49	35	I have been taking this medication for 2 months with no side effects: migraines have stopped, no acne, no mood swings, no weight gain, no spotting, and sex drive is still intact.
49	36	The only complaints are tender breasts practically constantly and 2-3 constant acne spots on my chin.
49	37	Since starting the pill I've gotten horrible acne, I'm bloated and gassy all day, every day, I'm extremely moody, my period is typically every 14 days with the occasional 5-7 week break (very rare though) and very heavy with horrible cramps, and I've gained 14 lbs; I was losing lots of my baby weight until I started this pill, since I've started this pill it doesn't matter how much diet and exercise I do, I can't lose the weight...
49	38	No blood, no period symptoms, no acne, no nothing!!
49	39	I had mood swings, irregular periods and slight acne issues the first 4 months but everything has evened out now.
49	40	Short menstrual, less acne
49	41	Aside from that I've gotten bad acne.
49	42	Worst acne of my life, heavy periods, weight gain, and discharge.
49	43	Break-outs have been more common in these 6 months just before my period starts, frustrating but controllable with sleep, a multi-vitamin and an acne cream to help.
49	44	I am back down to my pre pregnancy weight, no acne issues like others have experienced and no mood changes as I did with the Depo Shot.
49	45	I have experienced some acne but besides the tender breasts and acne I'm a happy camper.
49	46	Worked great at preventing pregnancy, but caused acne, severe anxiety, chest pain, tiredness, bloating and just overall blah feeling.
49	47	It also made my milk supply low which has me supplementing with formula and I have never had acne this bad in my life.
49	48	I've never had acne and my arms are now completely broken out.
49	49	I think it must be great for keeping you from getting pregnant though...who wants sex when you feel fat, tired, hungry, while covered in acne!
49	50	I've experienced mood fluctuations, moderate acne (unusual for me), hair loss and inability to lose weight.
49	51	Worst part: weight gain of 15 lbs and some facial hair and acne.
49	52	I've gotten increased acne, but not too bad.
49	53	I have been on the pill for 3 weeks and I've been expierencing hair loss, acne, sore breasts, fatigue, mood swings, and it lowered my milk supply.
49	54	It gave me extreme mood swings, frequent migraines, problems with my vision, depression, hair loss, extreme bloating, no sex drive at all, vaginal dryness,  increased acne on my chin , numbness in my feet,  and lack of sleep.
49	55	However, since taking this pill I have back acne like crazy!!!
49	56	I am 21 and am blessed to say have never had acne in the past.
49	57	I'm hoping my body adjusts to the lack of estrogen and weight gain subsides and acne clears up.
49	58	I've had headaches almost every day, and hormonal acne has increased (chin and forehead) also my hair has been falling out in clumps!
49	59	It doesn't help my acne, but I don't think it's making it worse.
49	60	I am acne prone and have broke out badly on every pill/ring I have taken before Lyza.
49	61	I'm a 16 year old girl who uses birth control for maintaining clear skin due to acne, nausea in the morning, and a heavy flow.
49	62	I typically don't have too much acne (about 3 pimples per month, if that).
49	63	I have NEVER had this much acne before.
49	64	I just picked up a new birth control today so hopefully when I start using this one the remaining acne on my face will go away.
49	65	But, it has not helped acne like my old birth control.
49	66	I've had terrible acne, breast tenderness (to the point of walking is painful) and I've put on about 15lbs.
49	67	I just switched to norethindrone about 4/5 months ago and sometimes I get extremely sensitive/sore nipples, vaginal discharge heavier than ever before, and a little bit of acne.
49	68	This medicine also made me have acne and I normally have very clear skin.
49	69	BUT now I have acne!
49	70	And now I have severe acne on my forehead, and slight acne on my chest, neck, chest, back and shoulders.
49	71	Headaches, acne (and I have amazing skin normally), urine smells funny and emotionally very unsettled.
49	72	I've been on this for 2 months and I have experienced cramping, acne breakout, low sex drive and breast tenderness.
49	73	Next thing ) I started breaking out in what looked like hives on my neck, chin and face.
49	74	HOWEVER while taking Errin I have gained two or three pounds so far and my skin is breaking out.
49	75	But this month I'm having mood swings.. My face is breaking out & I've always had nice clear skin & so far I've been bleeding 8 days straight & cramping every day as well which I've Never done!!
49	76	I was on the pill for 4 months and I started breaking out more than I ever had before.
49	77	Increased hunger,  non stop bleeding,  sore breasts, breaking out on face,  and I'm 30yo, don't need that.
49	78	Since I've been on Lyza I don't think I have gone more than 1-2 days at a time without breaking out.
49	79	I've only been taking Lyza for 3 weeks now and I started breaking out the first week and I have never broken out on my face before.
49	80	My face has been breaking out a little more than usual but I'm still trying to figure out whether or not the birth control is the culprit.
49	81	My skin was more oily & I've gotten the worst case of breakouts (big, red pimples on my cheek and a series of breakouts along my jawline).
49	82	With that being said there are two things I've noticed a few months into taking this, one is I have noticed an increase in pimples and my skin has gotten a bit more oily and the second one is my body hair (underarms, legs especially) seems to be growing much faster.
49	83	I've had a few pimples which is unusual for me.
49	84	I only took this med for 1 week and before starting had clear skin, well within 7 days I had broken out in a pimply rash on my face almost looked like mini pimples, was extremely emotional and moody, very very hungry, and worst of all my post partum bleeding instead of slowing down increased !
49	85	My Dr. changed me to the .35 dose and still the same weight but now more pimples and bled for 2  weeks.
49	86	One plus was no more zits!
49	87	I started it the first day of my cycle; bleeding seemed to get heavier with large clots (normally med-heavy with very small clots), constant headache, and I've broken out with very painful zits on my chin and forehead (skin is generally clear).
49	88	Haven't gained weight or gotten zits so I guess that's okay.
49	89	I'll finally get it cleared up for one day and then boom the next day painful zits pop up.
49	90	I’ve been taking Camila since July and the first few months were good; no cramps, no bloating, even no period.
49	91	I also have cramps now all day long.
49	92	I’m truly thinking about switching back to my combo pill because these cramps and long periods are killing me!
49	93	I experience bad cramps nausea starting a full week before my period.
49	94	I'm moody, cramps all the time, headaches....it's makes me sick.
49	95	However leading up to when my period is usually due (I tracked my cycles for years) I started having cramps feeling bloated & lasted for a few days (almost a week).
49	96	The cramps are deadly.
49	97	I’ve always had bad cramps but this is different now.
49	98	Along with that cramps came along.
49	99	After starting this pill I got cramps and by the 3rd day I had a full period with large blood clots.
49	100	I had such bad cramps during my period that I was in tears.
49	101	I have a few more cramps then usual.
49	102	I have had mild cramps every now and then.
49	103	I was on the combination pill which made me nauseous , tired and in the end I constantly kept spotting and getting my period along with worsened cramps.
49	104	I originally began taking this pill to lessen the pain of my period cramps and make them lighter.
49	105	It did make them lighter but my cramps did not improve.
49	106	Immediately, I get horrible mood dives, I get painful cramps in my legs and arms from the high cortisol estrogen was causing me.
49	107	Now my cramps are so horrible that I actually pass out from the pain and puke until the point where I would rather die.
49	108	Normally, my cycle would last about 4 to 5 days with little to no cramps or bloating.
49	109	I haven't been on any birth control in ten years (I always used condoms and have no kids) I am in a serious relationship so I got Movisse ( I am a smoker and this is what the Dr recommended) I started it the first day of my period as directed , I had the worst cramps ever!!!
49	110	My first day is always rough on my period and then goes away, with this is pill it went on for 3 weeks so bad, I couldn't leave my bed, I am crunched over in pain , it feels like my day one forever, I heard that if u stick through it your body settles but I just couldn't do it , I stopped taking it yesterday, I still have cramps and hoping it goes away soon, it was my only symptom but it is debilitating
49	111	I have awful mood swings and terrible cramps and I'm so bloated I don't even want to eat.
49	112	Half way through the second month on this pill, I got mass amounts of break through bleeding and such severe cramps that I ended up going to the ER!!
49	113	Normally, I get severe cramps and I heavily bleed for most of the 5 to 6 days I get it.
49	114	This period was very light and I barely had any cramps at all.
49	115	My cramps have been the worst ever and more clots coming out then ever before.
49	116	Next day cramps and felt like i was having a period/ bleeding feeling without bleeding.
49	117	This month 4 days prior to the end of the pack I developed abdominal cramps I mean really bad and a lot of breast tenderness now I've been bleeding very heavy with terrible cramps for 3 days .
49	118	For months at a time I didn't get no period and that was awesome because my cramps on period are terrible so that was a plus.
49	119	I would get bad cramps and my breast  would be so tender & painful for weeks!!!
49	120	I started to get a lot of cramps but even more that I used to get with my period..
49	121	I got on this birth control at 47 because I was tired of having bad cramps.
49	122	I had horrible cramps, broke out, was moody, and it killed my sex drive.
49	123	No pregnancy and no more cramps.
49	124	I was on Micronor for 3 weeks and had to stop it, I was getting different side effects, my breasts were so sore I could barely touch them and I was getting cramp constantly (upto the point I was taking tablets every four hours) and then I started getting really weird cramps which I can only describe as contractions, I felt hot and sweaty with these pains and felt like I was going to pass out, I stopped taking it after I had 3 of these attacks as it was making me feel unwell.
49	125	So they gave me this...severe cramps from the beginning and horrible back pain.
49	126	I have read other reviews and see this is common but I have had good swings,headaches, dizziness, cramps,bloating, increase appetite and heart flutters.
49	127	Normally I would have 10 day periods with excruciating cramps.
49	128	I don't get cramps much any more.
49	129	The first 2, I was concerned about how heavy my periods were and had quite possibly the worst cramps of my life.
49	130	I am also irritable,  moody and have cramps all of the time.
49	131	I have a very regular periods each month, which are naturally heavy and painful cramps.
49	132	I did have light cramps but not as bad like normal.
49	133	I had my period, then nothing for two days, then slight cramps and another light period for another 4 days, then nothing for about 5 days and yet again cramps today and next thing I know, I'm bleeding again.
49	134	And almost instantly after my 4 day trip , I started spotting and a day later it switched to a full blown period(cramps and heavy flow).
49	135	I did not get my period which is usual for me but I do have cramps.
49	136	Some cramps the first couple of days.
49	137	However, no cramps or anything like that is great!
49	138	I don't bleed as much during my period but my cramps are still the same.
49	139	I have been on this pill for a month and I have had my period 3 times, get headaches, cramps and worst of all its dried up breast milk which is why I went on the mini pill to avoid it.
49	140	No cramps to really reports, occasional night sweats, no headaches.
49	141	Lots of random cramps as well.
49	142	Now, this past week I've had on and off light bleeding and cramps during the last week of pills.
49	143	Oh, if you miss a pill by a few hours.. you start to cramp & bleed.
49	144	I do occasionally cramp every now and then between periods and I've also spotted for 2 days.
49	145	The only things I have noticed so far are some bloating, light spotting, very little fatigue (nothing compared to other birth controls), and a slight stomach cramp before my alarm goes off to take the pill (perhaps when its almost run out?).
49	146	Other pills had horrible side effects with my mood, and made me feel worse than ever, but since I've been on Heather (about 6 weeks) I feel great.. no bad moods, my skin has always been bad, so no changes there, my breasts have grown for sure, I'm just starting to spot and cramp mildly, but if that's going to replace my normal excruciating period, than I'm perfectly fine with that.
49	147	I don’t get any cramping, bloating, pain, weight gain and my periods were very light and short (2-3 days).
49	148	My mood is pretty normal, except for when I’m cramping & bloating.
49	149	I started my period today but I’m not cramping a lot or bad like I normally do which is abnormal for me!
49	150	Countless pregnancy tests bought -- because surely all of this bloating, cramping, weight gain, fatigue, EXTREMELY sore and swollen boobs means I'm pregnant!
49	151	I started it on Saturday the 19th and 6 days later period free, no cramping, no bloating, no back pain - nothing.
49	152	I am constantly bloated and always have severe cramping since I started.
49	153	For the first 3 months, I had some side effects ( tender breast, bloating, cramping, breakthrough bleeding) But after those 3 months, it was PER-FECT!
49	154	However, I've been on it 4 days and just have been feeling cramping and bloating.
49	155	I had cramping so bad that my DR ordered an emergency CT scan because he thought my appendix was going.
49	156	My period was shorter and less cramping.
49	157	I've been taking it for about a week and then started cramping and bleeding very heavily, about as much if not more than I was bleeding immediately after giving birth to my son.
49	158	After suffering from horrible depression, weight gain, fatigue, nausea, constant breast tenderness, unpredictabe periods and constant spotting, dizziness, trouble sleeping, and cramping.
49	159	Not having the intense cramping every month like I used to is nice though.
49	160	I'm not cramping so I suspect that this is what is referrred to as breakthrough bleeding.
49	161	It has helped my cramping and I no longer have periods.
49	162	At first I was skeptical cause I had a period that lasted about a week but after that they went away..I've experienced a little weight gain and tender nipples but for the most part I no longer have cramping and periods so it's all good :)
49	163	I also had cramping, hardly bleeding just spotting.
49	164	No weight gain, no cramping, nothing.
49	165	There has been severe cramping as usual and I feel awful and it's worse because it's happening so much more than before!
49	166	Normally no cramping, spotting, nothing.
49	167	He put me on Nora-Be and after 3 week I started with these side-effects: cramping, bloating, breast sensitivity, trouble sleeping, itchy scalp, and constipation, and still had a few migraines.
49	168	No cramping, bloating, weight gain, mood swings, nothing.
49	169	I don't even want to be on birth control, but my cramping and periods are so terrible without it.
49	170	I have experience every kind of mood swing possible, severe cramping and abdominal pain, headaches, nausea, heartburn, moodiness, and had severe irritability, and uncontrollable bursts of tears before and during my period!
49	171	At first I had mild cramping, but now everything is good.
49	172	I have been taking it for 7 days and I'm moody, crampy, my face broke out (I have clear skin),no sex drive, spacey, I'm extremely tired and I'm so overly hungry.
49	173	I started the pill again about a month or two later I've been on it for almost 2 months now and I'm still experiencing longer periods and spotting for two weeks or longer, I've gained a bit of weight but not sure if that's from the pill or not.
49	174	Overall I don't have any side effects other than the crazy amount of time I bleed and spot and some bloating, I'm trying to stick it out for at least a few more months to see if the spotting will stop if not I'm definitely not staying on the pill.
49	175	It started with random spotting everyday and I couldn't lose weight.
49	176	This is my first month on it and I started spotting the week before my actual period and now my period is so heavy I am changing my tampon (supers) every hour-2 hours.
49	177	After 3 months the non stop bleeding and spotting did stop.
49	178	I have absolutely no complaints, for the first month I had some slight, and random spotting but have not had a period since I started this pill!
49	179	Around my 5th week the spotting had just about disappeared to very light pink, hardly noticeable.
49	180	I started it on the first day of my period and since then, I have had some spotting, but doesn't bother me.
49	181	After two years, I had gained like thirty pounds (without ever changing my habits) and started experiencing constant spotting.
49	182	Sure enough, the weight AND the constant spotting has returned.
49	183	When I started taking it I felt pregnant, I've gained about 15 lbs since, last month had light spotting for 2 weeks.
49	184	Less heavy and painful period with only a little spotting.
49	185	I am about ready to stop this also last month I had break through spotting for 2 1/2 weeks.
49	186	However, I have a lot of spotting with this pill and it drives me insane.
49	187	(First time being on birth control) my period came a week ago and I'm still spotting.
49	188	I had light spotting for about a week and a half four days into taking the pill, then it completely stopped.
49	189	Now that I'm no longer breastfeeding, my period is lighter than normal and I have random spotting.
49	190	This is the only hormonal BC pill that doesn't give me mood swings or headaches, however, I do get frequent, heavy spotting throughout the month :(
49	191	I wouldn't even know I was taking anything except I have had spotting here and there on it.
49	192	I had still been spotting a little when I went to my post partum appointment and my doctor assured me that once I started taking the jolivette I would stop bleeding.
49	193	Continuous spotting.
49	194	I'll bleed for 4 weeks then be off for 2 days and start spotting again.
49	195	For the past two months, I have been spotting almost everyday, some days actually seem like a full-blown period.
49	196	It will stop for a day or two at most, and then I am spotting again.
49	197	I haven't experienced any other negative effects, but with this birth control being less effective than others on top of the months of spotting, it is not the best option for me.
49	198	I also had spotting and got my period 4 times in two months.
49	199	My doctor put me on lyza norethindrone tablets 6 days ago I started spotting on 5th day n still spotting today 6th day is the spotting ever gonna stop or am I gonna have a period nexted ?
49	200	I sometimes have spotting between periods, but now after about a year, I only get a period every 3 months or so.
49	201	I had no spotting otherwise (this time anyway), no other side effects other than my next period came almost a week early.
49	202	I have been on Lyza for almost a month now, I have had almost no spotting, no mood swings, no headaches, no troubles with blood clots/wheezing, nothing like my other experiences!
49	203	Nothing but spotting headaches and dizziness!!
49	204	My periods were completely unexpected and I had very random spotting for the first 2 months.
49	205	I just finished week 4 with no spotting or side effects so far!
49	206	I'm not sure about weight gain (as I did just have a baby recently), but I have had A LOT of spotting... and it feels like it's never going to end.
49	207	Plus so much spotting between periods.
49	208	I get my period every two weeks, my breasts are extremely sore all of the time and I'm constantly spotting.
49	209	A week into taking the pill, I started spotting.
49	210	I haven't had my period yet, but have been spotting randomly since I started the pills.
49	211	I've been taking Lyza for almost year now and I've had the usual irregular spotting throughout the months!
49	212	The only difference I've noticed is that the irregular bleeding went from one whole month of spotting to every other week!
49	213	My results: The first two months I had irregular spotting and two periods a month lasting 4 to 5 days each (the periods were 2 weeks apart so 4 in 2 months).
49	214	After that, the next 6 months I have been very consistent, one period per month starting on the same day each month and only lasting about 5 days and no spotting in between.
49	215	No physical side effects yet- spotting or bloating-which I was expecting.
49	216	First of all she is 2 months old and in that entire time I have been on a period except for 3 days of very light spotting.
49	217	After a month bi-weekly periods, I started spotting every other week and as a result it felt like I was constantly PMSing.
49	218	No weight gain, no cravings, no lack of sex drive, no moodiness, just spotting.
49	219	I'll take the spotting over everything else.
49	220	Well, I've gained 5lbs and had my period or spotting 27 out of the 42 days I've been taking it.
49	221	Sometimes it's light spotting and then sometimes it's heavy DARK blood within days of my normal period ending.
49	222	No spotting between periods.
49	223	For the first 3 months, the spotting seemed never-ending.
49	224	This past month, no spotting.
49	225	I also had a little spotting.
49	226	Than the next month I was spotting.
49	227	I've been taking this pill for over a year now and the only side affects I've experienced are spotting and not exactly knowing when ill be getting my period.
49	228	If I don't take the pill within my hour time frame, I'll usually encounter some spotting or even starting my period.
49	229	I had NO problems with my previous birth control, however with Camila I have not stopped spotting since I started it a month and a half ago.
49	230	I do not have spotting, weight gain, etc.
49	231	I think people may be having issues with spotting and heavy bleeding because they are not taking the pill at the exact same time every day.
49	232	The only downside is occasional spotting but my overall period is much lighter with little to no side effects.
49	233	I feel like I have had a period now non-stop or I just have spotting and no idea when my actual period is due anymore.
49	234	I would rather have no birth control pill at this point than all this spotting constantly!
49	235	Have had 3 different spotting occasions that haven't lasted more than 3 days at a time.
49	236	I've been on this medication (Nora-Be) for a little over a month now and my only complaint is that I have no idea when I'll get my period, the random spotting and the length of the period.
49	237	Each time I have spotting, I'm not sure if it's my period or spotting then when I finally got my period, I had no idea how long it would be (still having it 6 days later).
49	238	Some people would get spotting when they were even a half hour late taking this, I had no problem whatsoever when I'd take it late.
49	239	Sometimes the second one would be more spotting than bleeding, but still very annoying.
49	240	Two full periods, not spotting.
49	241	Also, no periods or spotting to speak of.
49	242	Light spotting then light bleeding.
49	243	I haven't experienced spotting.
49	244	After that I was spotting for several days which I have never experienced.
49	245	This past month I have either been bleeding or spotting and its incredibly frustrating!
49	246	Had spotting for weeks at a time.
49	247	I feel really great and aside from light spotting, I can't really tell that I'm on the pill.
49	248	The timing was an issue also, with other pills it's not that big a deal if you are half hour late but with this pill even as little as 30 minutes caused heavy spotting.
49	249	Also I had a complete menstrual cycle as well as spotting.
49	250	I love it I did spot and have 7 day periods for the first couple months, but I haven’t got my period since.
49	251	I did spot in between but no major bleeding.
49	252	I would have these horrible emotional PMS symptoms for like 3 weeks, spot for 2-3 days, normal for a week, and then back to the horrible symptoms.
49	253	My experience with this pill has been okay but my periods do last longer now for about 8 days and I also spot in between which is very annoying.
49	254	I'll sometimes get them every two weeks, sometimes I won't have one for 2 months, and sometimes I'll spot all month long.
49	255	I only spot when I forget to take the pill.
49	256	I started taking this pill in October of 2017, I was on it for about 2 1/2-3 months before I stopped it because I hated the fact that I bled and spotted for about 18 days.
49	257	I've never spotted so much in my life while being on any pill until I got on this one..and not to mention it gave me a period at least every other week.
49	258	At first starting Errin, I spotted for about 2 weeks but I figured that was because of not having a period for nearly 2 years.
49	259	I've never spotted before and I have taken this pill on time every day.
49	260	I spotted the whole month...
49	261	I spotted for about a month when I first started taking it, and then didn't get my period for about three to four months.
49	262	I also have a horrible headache and I’m bloated 24/7 which isn’t normal for me as well!
49	263	I have a constant headache almost daily ever since I started taking it.
49	264	I was put on micronor 4 months ago because I had headache with previous pills.
49	265	I also had a headache almost everyday.
49	266	I took it with toast and two hours later felt tingling in my face, was itchy, disoriented, had a headache, a sore throat, felt anxious and dizzy.
49	267	I woke up with paralyzing fear and had a headache will hallucinations all day long.
49	268	I had a minor headache the first couple of days.
49	269	But I was put on it since other birth control pills give me a headache and so far this pill has never given me a headache so at least that has worked.
49	270	It wasn't until I started getting headaches, becoming confused and couldn't concentrate where it became a problem.
49	271	It can cause significant weight gain, it can cause overall body aches and pains (headaches, sciatica pain, ankle and knee pain, muscle pain, tingling sensations from your nerves), tiredness, dizziness and moodiness.
49	272	It caused me to have severe headaches every single day, mainly behind my eyes.
49	273	I got pretty severe headaches.
49	274	Since I started the norethindrone, I have experienced just about every side effect listed on the medication: weight gain, hair loss, breast tenderness, mood swings, headaches, breakouts, the whole lot.
49	275	I literally felt like I was on a period 24/7, I even had headaches everyday, it got so unbearable I felt like crap 24/7 I couldn't take it.
49	276	I had tried Alesse, Yaz, Nuvaring, all of them giving me the worst headaches and weightgain.
49	277	I have had headaches, hairloss, mood swings,low sex drive, and irregular bleeding.
49	278	Other than that I've only had minor headaches compared to my usually intense headaches so that's a plus.
49	279	It's made me moody, I've gained 20 pounds, I constantly feel like I'm furious with everyone, it's given me consistent headaches and my doctor told me to at least give it a try for 3 months.
49	280	The first 2 days of taking Jolivette I had major headaches, nausea and dizziness so I bought complex B vitamin and took along with almonds and blue berries which helped me a lot.
49	281	I mean I love the pill the only problem I seem to have with it is headaches and trying to remember to take it every day at the same time....
49	282	But then again I exercise and eat fairly healthy on a daily, but I do get headaches and I'm pretty sure it's not from the pills it's more from me not wearing glasses and I have terrible vision!
49	283	I had to go off of it because it was giving me headaches, gained a lot of weight on it (even though my eating habits stayed the same), I was extremely forgetful while taking it.
49	284	First week brought some headaches, a little irritability, but it went away.
49	285	I have had headaches behind my eyes and some weight gain.
49	286	I had to switched out of the Ortho Tri-Cyclen combo pill because it gave me headaches.
49	287	I am still thinking this is too good to be true, but it has been a blessing so far to not wake up dizzy, fatigued, headaches, or nausea.
49	288	Some headaches with it.
49	289	I also have chronic migraine headaches, occasionally with auras, so that limits my options again.
49	290	I had terrible mood swings, weight gain, increase in appetite and low sex-drive, and the headaches were TERRIBLE.
49	291	I could no longer use estrogen because I started developing monstrous headaches and lost my sex drive while on Nuvaring.
49	292	I was on Gildess (hate that pill) and had HORRIBLE headaches.
49	293	The only problem is that I've broken out on my chest, but that's a lot easier to deal with than headaches.
49	294	So far I have experienced headaches from time to time.
49	295	On top of all this I've had migraines, sudden and very severe headaches.
49	296	Then I started having headaches all the time and nauseous so I thought I was pregnant.
49	297	I had horrible headaches and abdominal pain, I looked up the side effects one day on a hunch and all my symptoms were serious side effects.
49	298	I have not had a migraine since I switched to Lyza!
49	299	Due to my history of migraine with aura,  my doctor suggested I went with a non estrogen birth control.
49	300	Yes, my migraine wasn't as bad as how it was before but my period was very irregular.
49	301	After being on the combined pill for 5 years to help my menstrual migraines, a well informed doctor told me that I should have never been taking the combined pill if I have a migraine with an aura because apparently it can cause a stroke....
49	302	So I switched to this pill, and haven't had a migraine since!!!
49	303	The only plus side to this is I haven't gotten a killer migraine before the start of my period.
49	304	I was put on Lyza due to my hormonal migraines and it has helped but I would rather suffer the migraine than gain weight so I'm getting off these pills.
49	305	The migraine was gone for good, no pain at all.
49	306	Due to migraines I switched to this, which gave me no migraine.
49	307	It made me suffer from terrible migraines, bad stomach aches, mood swings, nausea, some dizziness and all on a daily basis.
49	308	I was switched to this birth control from Yaz because I’ve experienced aural migraines in the past- even though the Yaz helped them go away and made my periods lighter.
49	309	Had to go on the progesterone only pills do to migraines and stroke symptoms.
49	310	But I’m not pregnant and the migraines are gone so I’m giving this pill time to adjust to my body.
49	311	I was previously on Nuva Ring (which was amazing when I was in my early 20s), but in my early 30s I started getting aura migraines and my body was physically rejecting the ring.
49	312	My doctor put me on Lyza and the aura migraines went away, along with my period!
49	313	My Dr. suggested I switch to Lyza because I was getting frequent migraines with the last pill I was on.
49	314	I was extremely happy with my combination pill, but was forced to switch to Lyza about a month ago due to my aural migraines.
49	315	I have been on this birth control for years because of my migraines with aura.
49	316	I started this pill back in July because I was having migraines with auras and my doctor thought this would help.
49	317	I was put on Jolivette because I suffer from migraines and I can't have estrogen or I experience stroke like symptoms.
49	318	Due to my migraines with aura I can't take anything with estrogen in it.
49	319	I've been on previfem until recently when my doctor decided I needed a non estrogen birth control for my migraines.
49	320	I had pretty bad migraines the first month but decided to stick with it.
49	321	The migraines went away after the first month.
49	322	Because I have migraines, my doctor did not want me on a combined pill due to increased risk of stroke.
49	323	I am on this medication as I get migraines with an aura...preferred something I had control over vs an IUD.
49	324	I was put on this because combo birth control made me super dizzy with migraines and throwing up.
49	325	Was put on this due to terrible migraines.
49	326	I'm completely bloated,irritable and I have constant migraines.
49	327	I had constant migraines and I’d wake up very dizzy and nauseous.
49	328	I have been on Errin for 15 months and stopped taking it a week ago due to severe migraines, weight gain, moodiness and decreased interest in things that I usually enjoy.
49	329	After having awful hemiplegic migraines with aura (which mimics a stroke and is really scary) on the combined pill, my OB prescribed this instead.
49	330	I have not had one of these debilitating migraines since.
49	331	I got switched to this because I get auras with my migraines.
49	332	It gave me menstrual migraines, and periods every other week.
49	333	The menstrual migraines went away after three months, the first month the period pain went away.
49	334	I was put on Lyza at Planned Parenthood because of my history of migraines.
49	335	My doctor prescribed Micronor because I experienced depression and migraines with other pills.
49	336	I have pretty awful migraines, this PoP doesn't seem to contribute to them other than the first week of taking them.
49	337	My periods aren't as regular as they were with the patch, but, migraines.
49	338	It's the first pill I have used for contraception, and like a lot of other women here, I was recommended this one because I have a history of migraines.
49	339	I was prescribed micronor because I get migraines and I can't take combination birth control.
49	340	I am not allowed to take a combo pill because I have migraines.
49	341	My doctor prescribed this to me because I was having horrible migraines with one I was taking before.
49	342	I had been on an estrogen pill for 8 years, but new onset of migraines prompted my doc to give me this one.
49	343	I was on this pill a year and a half ago, I had no insurance at the time so I went to planned parenthood and they put me on this due to migraines.
49	344	I switched from combinations pills to this birth control because the estrogen gave me migraines.
49	345	No side effects, my migraines are gone.
49	346	I was on Ortho-Cycln for 16 yrs with no issues but had to switch to this one because of age and my history of migraines.
49	347	I was put on Nora-be because I was having ocular migraines and have symptoms of raynauds phenom, apparently these are contraindications for the combo bc pill.
49	348	I switched from a combined pill to Nora-Be about four months ago because the doctor said I couldn't take estrogen because of chest pain and migraines.
49	349	The pill is 100% very effective and no mood swings, no migraines.
49	350	I switched from a combined pill because of migraines, and will never go back.
49	351	I haven't been on this pill long,  but so far I haven't gotten any migraines, which is the main reason I switched to micronor.
49	352	I have migraines and I've found this pill to work really well for me.
49	353	I've been taking Lyza after being switched from my combination birth control at planned parenthood because of migraines.
49	354	I had heavy migraines with my previous pill so doctor recommended Jolivette.
49	355	I used to take Yaz for 2 years but had to stop due to migraines.
49	356	One of the main reasons I went on birth control was to control my period, since I have migraines however, I'm no longer allowed (per PPNE) allowed to have estrogen in my birth control which takes out that ability to control my period.
49	357	This particular pill was prescribed to me because of my chronic migraines.
49	358	I asked my doctor to change my birth control because of migraines.
49	359	It's also great because I no longer get migraines as opposed to being on an estrogen pill.
49	360	I was on Yaz for years and absolutely adored it, but had to switch to the mini-pill when I found out estrogen pills could cause major medical issues with my tunnel-vision migraines.
49	361	Switched to this after Ocella was causing severe migraines.
49	362	My doctor urged me to switch due to my risk of stroke on Loestrin because of my migraines.
49	363	I was prescribed norethindrone as an alternative to combination oral contraceptives because of the severe migraines with aura that I get with other oral medicines.
49	364	I have chronic migraines so many other birth control options are out of the question for me.
49	365	On Nora-BE/Camila I experienced heartburn, breast tenderness and increased migraines.
49	366	I also believe it has lowered my sex drive.
49	367	Also, I have no sex drive whatsoever.
49	368	I've tried several and always ended up with decreased sex drive, depression, and anxiety.
49	369	Extreme stomach pain, bloating, fatigue, and low sex drive.
49	370	Sex drive has been low.
49	371	Well mirena wasn't for me, it caused weight gain and loss of hair not to mention no sex drive and was still bleeding so I had the mirena removed on 6/18/16.
49	372	Oh yeah, and I have no sex drive at all.
49	373	I lost weight that I gained on previous birth controls so I liked that about this pill but now I've been on it for 6 months and I've noticed the past 2 months I've had little To no sex drive and it makes discharge REALLY thick I don't like that , also it's making it so it's nearly impossible to orgasm all of a sudden and I'm getting acne.I'm not super happy with this BC and I'm going to switch but I am glad it worked well for 4-6 months considering how sensitive I am to BC pills.
49	374	I used to be on Mirena and had great results with my cycle, moods, energy, sex drive, but the side effects were so bad I had to get it removed (constantly felt it poking, constipation, motion sickness), so after spending 5 years with hormonal imbalance after getting it removed (bad PMS, fatigue, low libido, no energy), I finally went into the doctor and told her I wanted to be on the same hormone, without the IUD.
49	375	I have no complaints about this pill besides a lack of sex drive.
49	376	I was depressed and my sex drive was altered, and my orgasms were sad.
49	377	Since being on this pill, my sex drive is through the roof (which my husband is so thrilled with), I don't have emotional highs/lows (and it may even be blunting my affect bc I don't really get sad at all anymore), and my skin looks great.
49	378	The worst side effect of all was my sex drive, it was practically non existent.
49	379	My sex drive has decreased and I have little or no interest in my husband.
49	380	I still have a sex drive although I have lost my period now for 3 months.
49	381	I had no sex drive what so ever, my head/eyes would bother me often, I became depressed and completely unhappy with life.
49	382	I have no problem remembering to take the pill, my sex drive hasn't changed and my periods are only two days long.
49	383	I have no sex drive and still am moody.
49	384	I was so frustrated I finally stopped using it , switched to FAM got my sex drive back , and have regular periods.
49	385	Spotting for the first 3 weeks and now it's all normal, plus my sex drive has gone through the roof!
49	386	Only thing is lower than normal sex drive.
49	387	So I've only been on the pill for a month and a week and its been good in comparison so the estrogen based birth control I was on previously because I have a sex drive and I'm not flipping out and acting crazy at all - but I keep getting what seems to be my period.
49	388	My sex drive increased after the first month and has remained strong.
49	389	No mood swings, decreased appetite, upped sex drive, bigger boobs, regular periods, and no babies.
49	390	It has NOT decreased my sex drive, thank goodness.
49	391	I got off of Ortho Tri Cyclen because it was making me SUPER moody and decrease my sex drive.
49	392	I haven't experienced any breakthrough bleeding like a lot of other people did (and I hope I never do), my sex drive is up, and I'm a lot more easy to get along with.
49	393	I have lost all of my mood swings, I feel so much better in general, I have lost weight and most of all ladies my sex drive is THROUGH THE ROOF.
49	394	The biggest con to this pill is that I have ZERO SEX DRIVE.
49	395	I also have a decreased sex drive and feel bloated almost all of the time.
49	396	I was moody as can be and experienced a painfully low sex drive (with equally painful intercourse).
49	397	I also didn't realize it at the time, but Errin seriously lowered my sex drive.
49	398	I switched from the Nuvaring (not sure if the bad mood swings, multiple yeast/UTI infections, and INSANELY low sex drive were because of the ring or because of a really bad relationship), and it's been great.
49	399	After the first pack, the tenderness was gone, my period went back to normal, and my sex drive increased.
49	400	I don’t think it messed with my libido but I do think it made me a lot drier during intercourse.
49	401	Here I am a year later, gained 60 pounds, on depression medication, lowest libido ever, moody, horrible periods, oh AND I'M PREGNANT after the first time not using back up birth control like condoms.
49	402	My mood swings are out of control, not to mention my complete lack of libido.
49	403	I switched from Vestura (generic Yaz) to Jolivette about a month and a half ago - I thought perhaps the Vestura was causing me to have a lower-than-usual libido.
49	404	I asked my pharmacy to switch me back to Vestura - the constant discomfort is not worth the possibility of a slightly increased libido
49	405	Jolvette made me gain weight bloat break out on my face feel depressed have low libido and very swollen soar breasts.
49	406	So far the only side effect increased libido, and I mean it's increased a lot.
49	407	As well as a decrease in libido.
49	408	I experienced some decrease in libido and severe vaginal dryness during my first month, but Replens (available in any drug store) took care of that right away.
49	409	I also experienced high levels of mood swings and weight gain.
49	410	And that from a woman who had to supplement with first 2 babies within their first 3 months because of low supply and low weight gain.
49	411	1 year in and the bloating and weight gain are out of control!
49	412	I’ve been on this pill for about 2 months, I wanted to try a low hormonal pill to hope for no or less weight gain.
49	413	NOW the weight gain is no joke.

49	417	I have also had weight gain, hair loss, and I am way more moody.
49	418	The huge issue I had with this pill was the mood swings and weight gain.
49	419	Since I exercise, I haven't noticed any weight gain or significant side effects after the first few days of taking it.
49	420	I never really experienced bad side effects like bleeding for an extended period of time or weight gain.
49	421	On Micronor, no weight gain, I was dieting so I managed to go from 130 to 115 pounds in two years on that pill.
49	422	A bit of weight gain as well.
49	423	You also get the bonus of horrible bloating, quick and noticeable weight gain ( I gained 15 pounds in 2 months, and I have an excellent diet).
49	424	To the point of where I'm crying with this medicine, weight gain, and my face has broken out like it has never in my life.
49	425	My periods are EXTREMELY heavy and lasts forever , bloating out of this world and minor weight gain.
49	426	Not to mention instant weight gain and constant hunger.
49	427	Very bad side effects; my Dr. recommended this pill because I wanted to avoid weight gain and have reliable birth control.
49	428	I have noticed a little weight gain.
49	429	I have noticed a lot of reviews mention weight gain, I can't say I experienced that per-say but I do notice that after a couple of weeks off of it I have stop craving carbs as much.
49	430	I haven't yet gained weight, since I was expecting a weight gain I started dieting and that helped.
49	431	Major weight gain, I'm a few pounds away from my pregnancy weight at 8 months.
49	432	(knock on wood) So I'm not to terribly worried about excessive weight gain.
49	433	I have had extreme mood swings,depression, and major weight gain.
49	434	As a result, I felt depressed because of my weight gain.
49	435	I'm already on anxiety meds but I don't take them and this doesn't change a thing in my mood I'm fine 100% I love this PILL-no weight gain either.

49	441	I haven't experienced any weight gain, or hair loss.
49	442	Weight gain aside, my periods are only about three times a year and only 2-4 days when I do get them.
49	443	Weight gain is ridiculous and it makes you feel so emotional.
49	444	While I have noticed a slight weight gain (5 lbs) my biggest concern is how tender my breasts are!
49	445	Not worth the additional weight gain after birth and the excess bloat is crazy!!!

49	449	No pregnancy, which is the point and no mood swings or weight gain.
49	450	Having given up hope that I could find a decent pill that didn't cause weight gain and depression, I made an appointment to get a Mirena IUD or the implanon.
49	451	However, a month and a half in, I have no weight gain, no moodiness, the only negative thing for me was my periods.
49	452	I've only noticed around a 8lb weight gain and it pretty much all went to my chest, I went from barely a B to a full C. Can't complain about that, lol.

49	456	I loved it, no weight gain, no side effects.

49	458	No weight gain, Acne, or anything.
49	459	I also have had a 15 pound weight gain.

49	467	I also experienced some water weight gain during the first few weeks, but Diurex helped.
49	468	I have gained some weight but nothing that isn't manageable.
49	469	I’ve gained 10lbs in a couple of months, I’m insanely bloated, I always have pressure in my lower abdomen and my my hair is thinning out like crazy!
49	470	For the few people saying they haven't gained weight on this pill, all I can say is, GIVE IT TIME!
49	471	If anything, the longer I stayed on it, the MORE side effects there were and the MORE weight I gained!
49	472	I’ve gained 6lbs in one month!
49	473	I have gained 30+ lbs but I also started methadone treatment around the same time so that could be the culprit.
49	474	Sure I've gained like 20 pounds in the few months I have been taking it.

49	485	I was extremely bloated and gained 5lbs since I started taking it.
49	486	I don't use scales because they are discouraging but if I had to guess I would say I've gained 15 to 20 pounds if not more.
49	487	My breasts got really sore at first and gained a cup size, but that normalized.
49	488	Then tried combined pill (lucette) and gained weight rapidly-even went up a cup size in a week.
49	489	I have gained weight but need to change my diet anyways.
49	490	I gained 16 pounds in 3 weeks taking Eerin.
49	491	I have since lost all the rapid weight I gained.
49	492	I haven't made any lifestyle changes, but in the past couple of months I've gained about 20 pounds seemingly out of nowhere.
49	493	My appetite has stayed pretty consistent, I haven't had access to a scale for a month or more, so I'm not sure if I gained weight, but my clothes fit the same and I work out regular, so I don't think I have.
49	494	I have not gained weight, but struggle losing it.
49	495	It makes me extremely bloated and I have gained 9lbs.
49	496	I gained about 8 pounds of water weight and I felt uncomfortable and bloated almost all day every day.
49	497	I have gained 7 lbs despite only eating soups and salads and cutting out carbs.
49	498	I gained 17 lbs in 4 weeks which is awful considering I was finally getting rid of my baby weight.
49	499	I had a period every other week, I broke out, I gained weight, I had mood swings.
49	500	I've also had an increased appetite and gained about 15lbs!
49	501	I wasn't eating well either, but I've NEVER gained weight this fast!
49	502	I haven't gained weight, and haven't bled at all either.
49	503	I also gained weight very fast and gained a lot of abdominal perimeter.
49	504	And I've gained about 8-10 lbs in a month, overall not good for breastfeeding moms.
49	505	Have gained 11 lbs!!!
49	506	On norethindrone my skin completely broke out, I gained 10lbs and started growing some facial hair.
49	507	I gained a lot of weight on birth control with estrogen and have not on Errin, which I liked.
49	508	I gained 30lbs while being on the shot and couldn't lose the weight until I tried Ortho Cyclen, which gave me extreme nausea so I wasn't able to keep any food down which caused me to lose the weight so yay but it was awful at the same time.
49	509	Otherwise, I have not gained weight though I have had chest pains.
49	510	I have gained about 5 lbs.
49	511	I have gained about 10 pounds on this pill and I had bad abdominal pain.
49	512	I did get some slight nausea the first two week of taking it, and my boobs where sore for the first two months but they also grew to a nice handful - I had rather small boobs before, so it was a nice perk.
49	513	Initially I went through the range of side effects including nausea, pmt etc but that was just for a couple of weeks.
49	514	Right now this would be my second month in this and I am experience nausea like I have to throw up has anyone else had this ?
49	515	And I get nausea once in a while, no vomiting though.
49	516	I do have slight nausea about 2 hours after I take the pill each night.
49	517	Had some of the more mild side effects like moodiness and nausea around my period.
49	518	I've been taking this only for two days but I'm experiencing dizziness, nausea and mood swings already.
49	519	I started this pill due to daily nausea and Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Diarrhea.
49	520	Took at night and was nauseated, lightheaded, and blurry mind.
49	521	I do feel nauseated when I take it without a meal.
49	522	I also felt nauseated and very cold.
49	523	I was nauseous and moody mostly but when I say moody I mean full on psychotic episodes...
49	524	The first three days on the new pill I was too nauseous to function.
49	525	The third day on this, I was feeling a bit nauseous for a couple hours.
49	526	I do get nauseous after taking my pill but I can live with that.
49	527	I will say every other birth control that I've ever tried made me nauseous.
49	528	However, I feel nauseous every morning and sometimes during afternoons.
49	529	I literally only took it for a week I had extreme dizziness also terrible bloating to the point I could hardly eat and I was constipated and super gassy.
49	530	I didn't experience any other side effects until the next week: dizziness, lightheadedness, and something I can only describe as a "mental cloudiness."
49	531	I had some severe dizziness that I my Dr thought was from Jolivette, it was not, so I went back on it.
49	532	The first week was a bit rough with some dizziness, increase in appetite, and slightly more emotional.
49	533	Just a little mood swing when I'm on my period.
49	534	First day on the new pill and already experience horrible bloating not to mention the massive amount of mood swings.
49	535	This has Been The WORST birth control i have ever been on , It has darkened my skin , gave me the worst mood swings & lets not begin on irregular periods.
49	536	My mood swings are horrible and I feel really anxious and depressed.
49	537	And on top of that, my mood swings are so intense that I find it hard to control the way that I'm feeling, and it is causing my friends to no longer want to hang out with me because I am cranky all of the time.
49	538	First off, my mood swings and depression were crazy.
49	539	I still feel like myself - without the mood swings or crying.
49	540	No symptoms, no mood swings ( unless PMS), and sometimes, I would just not have my period, which was fun on summertime.
49	541	Horrible pill gave me terrible mood swings one minute I was crying the other I was jumpy, I was feeling so tired and hopeless, worst contraceptive I've been I only took it for a month and throw the rest away
49	542	No mood swings or anything.
49	543	I have suffered from PMDD which is basically extreme PMS with really bad mood swings.
49	544	I rarely get periods, unless I'm super stressed out, no mood swings and no pregnancy (though that didn't become a concern until last year).
49	545	As soon as I started taking it I began to have intense mood swings, and was constantly emotional.
49	546	The mood swings does down after about a month or so on the pill, but I have also had multiple periods a month, with only 7 days in between.
49	547	So far it's been good no mood swings or bloated, I will continue to take it.
49	548	I always had strong mood swings and because I now rarely get a period I do not have ANY PMS MOOD SWINGS!
49	549	I highly recommend to anyone with terrible mood swings.
49	550	BUT the frickin mood swings that go along with it!!!
49	551	I was not having any side effects until recently I have been having very tender breasts, mood swings, and bloating.
49	552	Within days all side effects stopped, but my gp put me on Cerelle, which made me have insane mood swings and depression.
49	553	That's when I had constant bloating, break through bleeding and mood swings.
49	554	My mood swings were bad.
49	555	Has anyone else experienced such mood swings from changing minipill brands?
49	556	Horrendous mood swings.
49	557	I have been experiencing severe mood swings, anxiety, fatigue, and depression.
49	558	My mood swings were ridiculous, I am normally a happy person and chill.
49	559	Bleeding is very heavy and the mood swings and aches can be intense.
49	560	My mood swings are weird as well.
49	561	I had a miscarriage but my obgyn says it had nothing to do with the pill...I have horrible mood swings too.
49	562	The mood swings are so bad I'm considering getting off the pill altogether.
49	563	The thing I did have a problem with was the extreme mood swings and increased yeast infections.
49	564	My doctor and my husband didn't believe me about the mood swings, but I knew I wasnt *really* that emotionally unstable!
49	565	They were the first ones to believe me about the mood swings, so I finally got the courage to stop Nora-Be.
49	566	I am on a different POP (for almost a year now) and no more mood swings!
49	567	Way less mood swings than other pills I have been on.
49	568	But now I've been experiencing mood swings and depression in overdrive.
49	569	And it caused severe mood swings, specifically deep depression, irrational thoughts, and anger.
49	570	I've never had mood swings with it until here recently.
49	571	The only negative side effects I've had is longer bleeding per cycle and mood swings when I go off and onto the pill.
49	572	The mood swings happen with every type of birth control I've used, so that isn't so abnormal.
49	573	And sometimes my mood swings are very intense.
49	574	Everything was fine at first, in the last 2 months I've had serious mood swings which is atypical for me but the worst of it all is I have had SERIOUS HAIR LOSS!!
49	575	I've been on this pill for about 9 months now, and while I love not having a period and no mood swings.
49	576	I've also had extreme mood swings that seem to be driving my family insane.
49	577	It made me have mood swings that my husband noticed.
49	578	I also have mood swings, anger and very sensitive nipples a week before period.
49	579	It has given me some anxiety and increased my mood swings.
49	580	Abnormal bleeding all month long and severe mood swings.
49	581	Also have felt huge mood changes, anxiety depression easily irritated.
49	582	I was nervous to start this pill due to all of the negative reviews of it.
49	583	I would wake up and feel nervous and freaking out for no reason
49	584	I have been depressed, anxious, nervous, angry, it's been a nightmare.
49	585	Upon readings Errin's reviews, I was nervous.
49	586	Not only did it make me a raging bitch for months, it also made me more depressed and anxious than ever before, and gave me the most severe "period" in my whole life.
49	587	I feel overwhelmed, anxious, bloated and very emotional.
49	588	I will never take this again, I have a cloud over my brain, I yell at my children, angry at my husband for having freedom to leave without 2 kids, anxiety, paranoid.
49	589	I’m not moody, no depressive episodes, no anxiety, nothing.
49	590	I've taken different BC pills before and always suffered severe anxiety and depression just before starting my period.
49	591	So far I have had more anxiety and I feel random pains I only been on this for a week now
49	592	I was having horrible crippling anxiety everyday for most the day and I already have depression and anxiety disorder.
49	593	The first week I had very high anxiety levels which was difficult to push through but after 10 days it subsided.
49	594	And on top of that, it gave me horrible anxiety.
49	595	After about a week of taking this pill, I started to experience heightened anxiety.
49	596	Mood is better, no anxiety, I can sleep!
49	597	I was totally skeptical about taking Jolivette after reading the reviews, I was convinced that everything that happened to everyone here i was for sure going to experience, specially because I suffer from anxiety,  constipation and other stomach problems.
49	598	Also, I noticed that my eating habit has gotten worst, I became tired but sleepless and often get anxiety attacks.
49	599	It caused me to have depression over my weight loss anxiety.
49	600	I started Micronor because the other birth control made me have high levels of anxiety.
49	601	My doctor put me on this bc of the no estrogen and I was suffering from postpartum anxiety.
49	602	The chest pain and anxiety was enough for me.
49	603	For someone like me who is predisposed to anxiety, this can be stressful.
49	604	Then 2 weeks later I started getting breast tenderness like now I normally do before a period but it was too soon so I was confused, but then today my period came almost a week earlier than normal, and it seems heavier than how they usually are on the first day.
49	605	This month I have had a little breast tenderness, but not significantly, and a couple of days light breakthrough bleeding.
49	606	The only thing I really noticed is breast tenderness for the first month pretty much constantly but it wasn't unmanageable.
49	607	I've been on this bc for 2 and a half weeks and so far the only thing that I have experienced is breast tenderness and more tired than usual.
49	608	Some breast tenderness and back pain about a week before my period.
49	609	I've been on this pill for 1 month and its been treating me good so far, only side effects experienced was breast tenderness, increased appetite, itchy scalp.
49	610	My job is very physically and mentally demanding, and it hasn't affected it, accept maybe my breast tenderness.
49	611	Like many others, this pill causes me extreme breast tenderness.
49	612	I do have breast tenderness at times.
49	613	I experienced a heavy period and breast tenderness at first after I switched from Ortho Novum 7/7/7.
49	614	I have only been on for a month but I had the tender breasts as well.
49	615	Sometimes I get very tender breasts as well.
49	616	I can say for sure Nora-Be calmed my breakouts and moodswings which is great....but it definitely gave me a heavy period, bloating, fatigue, depression, aloofness, itchy/dryness, and tender breasts.
49	617	I've now had my period twice in less than a month and sore breasts since I started it.
49	618	The first month I took this pill I had extremely tender and sore breasts.
49	619	Gave me a terrible yeast infection And I will never take this medicine again.
49	620	I love it, doesn’t make me feel sick, and since I switched to this birth control I haven’t had one yeast infection, which was very common with my birth control before.
49	621	But all of a sudden I got a uti,yeast infection,always hungry.
49	622	Finally, I had a recurrent yeast infection, which may or may not have been related, but it certainly didn't help.
49	623	This has been my 5th contraceptive and I like it the best.When I was on nuvaring and cryselle I developed vulvar vestibulitis (similar, but not vulvodynia).My GYN thought that I had chronic yeast infections for about 2 years and she finally realized it could be the hormones causing this painful condition.Since sharobel has no break in the drug (no sugar pill week) my horomones levelled off.
